While the data set may be much smaller, you can already make initial comparisons between someone who's been in MMA for 10 years vs someone who's been boxing for 10 years.<MrKoontar>: has there been? i have yet to read this study, if you could find it again and provide it id love to see it. if you're going based off of simply \"hurr durr he hit his head more\" then im sorry to inform you there are many mechanisms involved in concussion and brain trauma that can cause encephalopathy just as often as taking a punch to the head, how often does a football player get punched? in MMA you can take knees, elbows, get ground pounded, get suplexed into the mat etc etc<CaptainK3v>: https://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/Citation/2016/07000/Combative_Sports_Injuries___An_Edmonton.12.aspx You can buy it there or the relevant summary is here <https>://www.thejournal.ie/the-journal-factcheck-mma-boxing-safety-injury-2713577-Apr2016/ I'll reproduce here &gt;Head injury Probably the biggest concern about MMA (and boxing) is the prevalence and long-term effects of blows to the head, concussion, and traumatic brain injury. So how do the two sports compare on this score? Only one peer-reviewed scientific study has included a comparative analysis of injuries across MMA and boxing in the same study \u2013 a 2015 paper by Dr Shelby Karpman from the University of Alberta in Canada. The research, which attracted widespread media attention last autumn, found: Professional boxers were more likely to sustain no injuries in a given contest MMA fighters were more likely to sustain injuries in general, but those injuries were more likely to be relatively minor (bruising, and so on). Professional boxers, on the other hand were significantly more likely to suffer severe injuries, including loss of consciousness and serious eye injuries such as retinal detachment. Boxers were almost twice as likely to sustain a concussion that involved a loss of consciousness Average medical suspensions for boxers were 26 days, compared to 20 days for MMA fighters, which also suggests a higher prevalence of serious injuries You should drop the thesaurus and focus more on making cohesive arguments instead of trying to sounds smart. &gt;then im sorry to inform you there are many mechanisms involved in concussion and brain trauma that can cause encephalopathy All this shit is getting bonked in the head. Bonk head, bruise brain, brain work worse. Boxing bonk head lot, brain break more. Why does it matter if you got knocked out by a punch, kick, door, car, whatever? Or did you just want to use the word encephalopathy since you just learned what it meant watching Greys Anatomy?<MrKoontar>: why does it matter how you get knocked out? because the force that a punch transmits to your brain \"bonking around\" is smaller than if your head hits the ground or you take a knee to the head Also if you actually bothered to read even the summary the data compiled is a post-fight analysis, nothing in this study has shown any definitive proof of increased incidence of CTEs (which as a mentioned earlier is definitively examined post-mortem) which going back to my original point that there is not enough significant data collected on the relatively infantile sport of MMA to show conclusive evidence that MMA fighters dont end up \"retarded\" as often as boxers. Just last year we had Parsons become the first MMA fighter to die at the age of 25, and guess what, he was diagnosed with CTE post-mortem. im sorry if my diction flies over your head, i dont usually copy/paste articles verbatim to get my point across, they discourage that in medical school<CaptainK3v>: Right sorry, makes perfect sense. Every punch, kick, knee, baseball bat, tackle, and slam all hit with consistent force. Since they're all the same every single time, it totally makes sense to nitpick over the tool used to apply force to the skull. Too bad you can like measure the amount of concussions people have practicing in a given sport. Not that it would matter, it's not like there's a link to concussions and CTE. <MrKoontar>: but...you cant definitively measure the amount of a concussion. concussion protocols are growing almost every year with more understanding but the methods used are still for the most part rudimentary and not specific/sensitive in diagnosing the amount of damage actually done <CaptainK3v>: 0&gt;1?<MrKoontar>: i guess concussions are all the same to you, go figure, sounds like you've had plenty<CaptainK3v>: Have fun at \"med school\"!", "num_messages": 16, "avg_score": 1853.875}

They are making no sacrifice. I don\u2019t get it. I have an idea, let\u2019s honor all the billionaires who sacrifice their humanity and the environment in the name of profit. God Bless them. Edit Lol. The Onion. Just noticed lol. Im a jackass.<DrButtLicker69>: Are most soldiers doing it or free? No, they are getting paid what they are worth, just like the NFL players. If you don\u2019t like that you don\u2019t like capitalism or America. <Livy_the_Modern>: Soldiers are not being paid what they are worth in the same sense as a football player. The army isn\u2019t a business or run by capitalist principles. It does not create wealth. It\u2019s literally the exact opposite, it\u2019s a drain on wealth. But then you can argue it protects wealth and so on. That being said you can hold the sentiment OP holds and still love capitalism, a Soldiers worth is not measured in quarterly sales. (even though it\u2019s the Onion and his opinion was out of place to begin with.)<DrButtLicker69>: The vast majority of soldiers join up because of the pay and benefits, which is often the most they can get with their education and skill level. In that context they are getting paid exactly what they are worth. <Livy_the_Modern>: Is the nfl any different? By your argument I have a higher education than most players, but I\u2019m in the Army and making waaaaaaaaaay less than the average nfl player. On average 80% of Majors have a masters or higher and still get paid waaaaaaay less than an nfl player. That being said higher education does not equal intelligence or competence. <DrButtLicker69>: NFL players are world class athletes and their job generates billions. There are only a few thousand people in the world that can play NFL football. Any schmuck with a high school education can join the army. <Livy_the_Modern>: You are the one that brought up education. Now you\u2019re deflecting to skill. The NFL is a business, the Army is not. Your worth is not based on the income you create because it\u2019s not the purpose to create any. Any schmuck can\u2019t join, There are still requirements and one if the reasons less than 1% serve. It\u2019s the same reason the retention rate is very low as you move up in ranks. To get anywhere above E7 or O4 requires some of the best and smartest leaders in the world within the profession of the military. People who can manage hundreds to thousands of Soldiers and millions of dollars of equipment on and off the battlefield. You\u2019re dumbing down the Army based on false presumptions and assuming the army only consists of private\u2019s with no training.<DrButtLicker69>: Less than 1% serve because most people with better options take those options. Which is why they typically don\u2019t get the best and brightest to sign up. Sure there are some great and talents people. But most are bottom of the barrel guys who would be working at McDonald\u2019s if the army didn\u2019t take them. <Livy_the_Modern>: The NFL is what you see after filtering out all the rest, decades of lower level playing, highschool, competitive leagues, college then pro level. You only see the best at this point. The army doesn't have a lower level to train before you're a Soldier. We are bunched together from the start. I train the new Soldiers ( think high school player) to hopefully become a NCO or field grade officer (pro player) all the while we work together, no separation by leagues. The Army, over time, creates the best or you don't make it. Everyone cannot make it 20 years in the Army. 1% of the 1% make it. To go back to your initial statement, again, just because many join instead of going to college does not make them stupid or incompetent. Just today I had one of those \"mcdonalds\" level Soldiers working on a $25,000 piece of commo equipment and fixed my problem. There is a very small group of Soldiers I've met that joined because they had no other option, your opinions are coming from 0 experience and lots of action movies and false assumptions like this dumbass idea that they'd only be able to work at mcdonalds. <DrButtLicker69>: I grew up in a navy family. Both my parents are navy vets. My brother has been in the army for 12 years. I know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. He was an idiot, barely passed high school, and would have likely ended up in jail if not for the army getting him out of trouble when they wanted to send him to Iraq. Every guy I grew up with that went into the army was an absolute moron with nothing else going for them. Granted they all joined during the Iraq war when the army was desperate. <Livy_the_Modern>: Wow you had family that served that must give you lots of experience. I apologize for trying to teach you about the military; Thanks for your service! /s you know exactly | | that much. =/ AGAIN! Joining the NFL doesn't make you smart. Giving me a few examples of dumb people joining the Army does not reflect the entire army, especially when I just explained the training process leading to a pro player compared to a Soldier or sailor. You are generalizing. I've made my points and you haven't countered a single one with any facts. &amp;#x200B; Also are you parents complete idiots too? Like going to jail if they didn't join?<DrButtLicker69>: 99.99% of people in the military would quit if given the choice between the military or playing in the NFL. Ipso facto NFL players are better. <Livy_the_Modern>: K, guess you win. Now \"better\" means what you'd rather do. =/ So back to my question, your parents? Complete dumbasses; felons?<DrButtLicker69>: They are definitely not educated. But they are fine people. Probably upper tier for military folk though. <Livy_the_Modern>: \"Upper tier for military folk\" So probably much smarter than you or the average American. Because upper tier is at least a masters and more than likely a PHD; probably in business or something like Logistics Management. Plus Naval war college? Maybe trained at a foreign military institute to broaden their training, and I'm assuming commanded a vessel or at least close it it?<DrButtLicker69>: Nah they got out into the private sector. Because they are smart. <Livy_the_Modern>: Okay so they are smart! They joined the military as an intelligent person; weird huh? Have a good night!<DrButtLicker69>: Yeah they did. I said 90+% of military folks are morons. Not everyone.

The details of the issues have been subject to much speculation, but Celtic's manager described them just as mental health issues. There are plenty of rumours, but because they are just rumours I won't repeat them - if you really want to see them they're not hard to find. \"It's OK not to be OK\" is a statement used to try and take away the stigma of talking openly about suffering from mental health issues, and to combat the idea that somehow it is a fault in the person if they're not feeling okay sometimes. Putting it all together: the banner held up in the picture is from last night when Celtic played FC Salzburg in the Europa League. The game was held at Celtic Park and it was held up by Celtic fans as a showing of empathy and support for their player. Griffiths wears the number 9 shirt for Celtic, and the picture is from the 9th minute of the game when cheers of support were made by the fans, and the camera broadcasting the game showed the banner on TV.

Also, more people have heard of major and minor league baseball as opposed to mountain west college football.<owlbrain>: Well except the minor league teams are effectively owned and operated by the major league teams. That's not how the tiers work overseas. A minor league team couldn't compete against a major league team no matter what as all the good player would be reassigned to the main team. In CFB mid major teams beat major teams all the time. Also in college football the power five conferences get automatic invites to (better) bowl games that the MWC doesn't. Which would be very similar situations to getting invited to the champions league and things like that overseas.<luzzy91>: Idk, I agree with you but I still think that in a comparative, uh, descriptive sense, a single A team going to AA, a AA going to triple, and a triple going to the \"premier\" league makes more sense.

I don\u2019t mean she hit the net or served out of bounds sometimes. I mean she went full on physically retarded every time she tried to serve. Sometimes she\u2019d toss it up and whiff it, complete swing and a miss. Sometimes she\u2019d sail it 15 feet out of bounds on the far side. Quite often, she\u2019d send some weird angle shot into the stands, or hit the bench. Sometimes she\u2019d just tip the ball and it would sort of roll away. It was fucking terrible.

When you punch an object, the force is literally coming from either your body's change in momentum, or from the friction of your feet on the ground. <TheFlyingSaucers>: You are aware that players can control their friction by adjusting the position of their skate blades right?<nate1235>: Yeah, and they seem to be doing a fantastic job of that in the video.. <TheFlyingSaucers>: Because every person has the same amount of fighting skill...Jamie Benn is a skill player who is also super tough. The really good fighters will put theirs skates at an obtuse angle for power. Here\u2019s an example from a while ago: <https>://youtu.be/yJJPivHWy2k Skip to 1:13 for fight<nate1235>: Dude, you're missing the point. Someone said earlier that the power of a punch comes from the torso, but all I'm saying is that the torso merely transfers the force from the friction of the ground to the offending party's face. <TheFlyingSaucers>: It seemed like you were saying they couldn\u2019t get friction though <nate1235>: Obviously they can. These guys aren't doing a great job of it, though. I would say that they would hit harder if they had shoes on and weren't standing on ice.", "num_messages": 11, "avg_score": 109.2727272727}

I have never understood how this sport is called football, when the ball is thrown? More like National Handball League. <WompSmellit>: Football is a very old term for a game played on foot, rather than on horseback. There are a lot of kinds of football: American, Australian, Gaelic, Association, Rugby, probably more. They're all descended from British schoolboy games that were called football because they were played on foot. <GoPadres69>: Then why isn\u2019t tennis, racquet ball, basketball, baseball, etc., also called football? Aren\u2019t those sports played on foot? They all use a ball too. Any idea? <WompSmellit>: They didn't evolve from British schoolboy games called \"football\"? [I mean, I'm not making this up, this is where the name comes from.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_public_school_football_games)<GoPadres69>: I hear you. But I did some research and the actual understanding or qualified term is the act of kicking a ball to make a goal. The term has derived into different variations today. <WompSmellit>: Read the article I pointed to. In the **17th century** they were talking about \"football\" that was more like rugby or US football: &gt;There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball before [another player] does\" or to \"snatch\" it (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the \"charging\" and pushing/holding of opposing players (\"Keep him out\" above, \"drive that man back\" in the original, \"repelle eum\" in original Latin). This game is likely to have been similar to rugby football.<GoPadres69>: Interesting. However, I have also read sources stating football dates back as far as the 9 century. Nonetheless, I know many people will say it\u2019s my personal view; but I consider true football using the feet. To each his own. I find the NFL very slow and boring, plus all the commercials are a killer. <WompSmellit>: Watch what you want, I don't care. I'm just talking about where the name comes from. \"Football\" = \"game played with feet\" is probably a false etymology, is all I'm saying. Anyway, I'm done.

Until then, I dont care if he is illiterate and needs help ordering off of a McDonald's menu. He isnt getting paid to read us bedtime stories, or solve an organic chemistry formula. He is paid to play basketball, which is why we all watch him. You let me know the next time the 4 foot 0 inch asian chem/bio double major hits a shot like Doncic.

But now we have athletes who some look up to as gods and often try to imitate them but they probably got coddled their whole educational career so who knows how much they actually learned during their athletic scholarship at whatever university/college they went to. Now they're trying to say they don't think something happened (Kyrie flat earth is another example)? Bro you weren't even born yet when the moon landing happened.

My three year old does all the time...<LORD_BIKO>: oh pls<OohMatron>: You've never been playing with friends and done this? This has never occurred to you? Come on. <Bradytyler>: I think there\u2019s a bit of a difference between doing this against friends and a fucking NFL defense. One of the best NFL defenses too. <OohMatron>: Yes there's a bit of a difference. But this isn't this astoshing thing people are trying to hype it up to be.<KarlHungusIII>: By a bit of a difference, you mean an entire universe of difference. This was an incredible play. <OohMatron>: LOL. Okay. Other than the fact that there was no one around him and he wasn't going to pass to anyone else I'd say that defense was indeed, absolute beasts....<KarlHungusIII>: He evaded the pass rush while keeping his eyes downfield and threw a dart to a receiver whom he wasn\u2019t looking at and was decently covered. You can minimize it all you want, but it\u2019s a great play and just a tad more difficult than picking up your fork without looking directly at it. <OohMatron>: So he: had people move out the way by team mates, threw a pass which is what he does all day every day, and his team mates did their job too. So what HE did was throw a pass. You're right, it is just a tad more difficult. <KarlHungusIII>: Actually, he had to evade pass rushers that his teammates didn\u2019t move out of the way, and then threw a pass across his body WITHOUT EVER LOOKING AT HIS TARGET. If you tried that, guaranteed you throw it in the dirt five yards away from you. I\u2019m not saying other quarterbacks couldn\u2019t make that play, but there\u2019s a reason they don\u2019t (it\u2019s fucking hard and high risk), and it\u2019s hilarious that some Jimmy Lipper on the internet who probably can\u2019t tie his shoes without looking is desperate to downplay it. <OohMatron>: How you never played the sport before? Go try this with a friend. It's not difficult at all. They throw passes to each other all day. He knows the plays he knows where he's gunna be and when. He could have done it with his eyes closed. The reason it's so rare to see this is because players in this sport are just chess pieces. They're not paid to think or have flare and be fun to watch. They're paid to just do that one task they do. He would still have gotten an ear full for doing this even though he made it. Any player reading these comments is probably laughing their heads off or eye rolling. <KarlHungusIII>: &gt; He would still have gotten an ear full for doing this even though he made it. Any player reading these comments is probably laughing their heads off or eye rolling. Chiefs coach Andy Reid: \u201cIt\u2019s something to do in a practice, but then you start throwing it in a game, and a game against the No. 1 defense in the National Football League, that\u2019s a little different,\u201d Reid said. \u201cYou gotta have tremendous confidence in what you\u2019re doing there. ... I haven\u2019t seen a lotta guys do that. I was around (Brett) Favre, he did some amazing things that way, Donovan (McNabb) and those guys, but no... that umm... No, not quite like that.\u201d So that debunks your theory that he got chewed out for it and that it\u2019s commonplace and not that difficult. Also... &gt; How you never played the sport before? Go try this with a friend. It's not difficult at all. Anyone who has played or just has an ounce of knowledge of football knows trying something with your friend in the backyard is not remotely the same as doing it in a game against one of the top defenses in he league. <OohMatron>: That tv interview he did debunks what happens in a dressing room? This is explains why you think this is some crazy sporting achievement.<KarlHungusIII>: It\u2019s better than your assumption (based on absolutely nothing) that he got reprimanded for making a great, unique play. And your second \u201csentence\u201d explains why you\u2019re an idiot. <OohMatron>: He threw the ball to the player he was supposed to. What. A. Thilling. Play. It honestly beggars belief that this is only a US citizen watched game when incredible things like this happen. Why is it that Wembley is full of ex Pat's and not British people desperately trying to watch an NFL game? Idiots. Which passes like this happening only ever once, why wouldn't they go? Why isn't this a global game yet? Why?<KarlHungusIII>: Ah, you prefer 90 minutes of running and minimal action when you watch sports. It all makes sense now. <OohMatron>: No I prefer a sport. By athletes who don't require oxygen after each play. A sport where people aren't amazed by catching a pass or gaining a yard. Have you never wondered why the world watches rugby and football and basketball and hockey but not NFL? Wait, hang on, someone just gained two yards!!! I gotta rewatch this and over analyze this for the next ten minutes with some advertising shot in there before we can see them lose the two yards in the next play! Amazing!!!!!<KarlHungusIII>: If you don\u2019t like or know anything about football, why are you here making yourself look dumb? Soccer and basketball are the most popular sports in the world because they\u2019re cheaper and easier for anyone to play. <OohMatron>: I know more than enough about gridiron. I enjoy playing it. But to watch it is absolutely fucking excruciating. Celebrating a catch to gain five yards? Nothing short of sport comedy. <KarlHungusIII>: This was a completion for more than five yards, and it wasn\u2019t just an ordinary throw. Your insistence on shitting on it is odd. It was a cool play you almost never see. Also, everything you\u2019ve said in this back and forth indicates you know a lot less than you think about football. <OohMatron>: Why do you never see this? Answer that question. Just make sure you don't say because it's really hard because you wouldn't see someone like Mahomes make it. You'd have to see someone like Brady do it. If it's that hard how come PM can do it?<KarlHungusIII>: Mahomes is different than Brady. He\u2019s a better athlete with a stronger arm, which is why he was able to throw on the move and across his body and not lose much velocity. As far as the no-look part, that\u2019s just an instinct that Mahomes has. You never see other quarterbacks do it because it\u2019s risky to throw where you\u2019re not looking, but Mahomes has a penchant for free styling. Mahomes can do a number of things Brady can\u2019t or just doesn\u2019t do. Even Andy Reid, who has been around some great quarterbacks and improvisers, said what Mahomes did is unique. I\u2019m not even sure what argument you\u2019re trying to make anymore.", "num_messages": 23, "avg_score": 1943.5652173913}

On ice you have to carry all that equipment and all of your thrust must be directed into two 4mm blades (even less so since it's just edges on those blades).

Need to visit the ufc sub more often.<G-Shiznit>: yeah man, Jones won the first fight but it's widely regarded as his toughest fight and the closest he's come to losing (some people actually thought he lost the fight).

Subbed to that sub.. Since tony vs pettit and khabib's fight i have been drawn back to ufc... Would love a tony vs khabib..<G-Shiznit>: no worries man. Oh yeah, I think that whole sub has been wanting that fight. 4 times (i think) that they've tried to get that fight to happen and it's fallen through. Khabib rushed to the hospital because of his weight cut, Ferguson tripping on a cord and messing up his knee/leg. The mma gods don't seem to want that fight to happen<mercified_rahul>: Haha, but with dana I think anything is possible, if you don't know I would lile to suggest you joe roegan podcast, you will like it.<G-Shiznit>: oh for sure.

Both teams were good enough to get there regardless of the bracket they faced. Neither team put out slouch squad, and if losing was the goal, they both did an extremely poor job of trying to lose in that game.

Everyone wants to talk up Brazil but they were awful and lucky to make it as far as they did. If they spend less time trying to get players booked for diving and actually played the game, I would have a different opinion but that's exactly what they did.<Flinko2010>: &gt; I think they were a lot better than both Japan and Brazil You don't know what you are talking about lol You really only got that far because of how weak the lower bracket was. Your wins were shaky and you lost every game against a good team<tehDarkshadE>: I actually know exactly what I'm talking about. Brazil were absolute trash outside Willian. If they would have had proper officiating in their group stage games, they wouldn't have made it out of their group. Neymar too busy rolling around like a baby every time someone got near him. He should have been sent off 3 or 4 times for diving but because he's a big name player, they were scared to do it. It took most of the world making fun of him for his cheating antics before anyone had the backbone to not call fouls on his dives. As for Japan, I don't think they had enough quality to get past the first round of the knockout against anyone. Their coach was reluctant to start Honda which ended up costing them as he was their best chance at scoring. When he and Kagawa were on the field together, Japan looked their most dangerous. e You can shit on the bracket all you want but England still had to win against teams that were good enough to make it through their groups. Croatia deserve to be in the final; they've looked more convincing that a lot of the \"better\" teams in the tournament. In the end, it doesn't matter how much talent a team has; its all about results and execution. England had that up until today.", "num_messages": 14, "avg_score": 1517.5}

It's good hockey and people play quite hard at the upper levels...but everyone is looking to go home with all their teeth so that's more compatible with my old man body. In my 'real' playing days I played in the ECHL and at the varsity level in college. (obviously all the MN youth stuff too) Why do you ask? [deleted]: MN wild adult league is the worst if you\u2019re not in A league Bunch of middle aged men looking for a fight, have been asked to \u201cmeet me in the parking lot multiple times\u201d once had this loser intentionally shoot a puck at my head. <lowcrawler>: They dropped the A league (which just resulted in B becoming 'A' and C becoming 'B' and so on... it was stupid) A lot of it depends on the refs you get... if you get the scarecrow looking jackass and his partner... yeah, the game might get out of hand because they just want to go home. Ron's good at reading the vibe and keeping things under control, as are a few others. I think a lot of it has to do with the demeanor of your own team, too.... I've been on a few in that league and some had chips on their shoulders and almost every game ended up with a scrum. Then I was on a very live-and-let-live team and we almost never had issues. My current team is in the middle and we only have flair ups a couple times a season. Even then, it's normally just 'pushing' and stuff. In my time in the league, I've only ever once seen a true 'fight' and even that, no one got hurt. That siad, compared to the AHA, yeah... it's got more boneheads. I think part of that is that the AHA is sooooo much more expensive and more strict about appearances that it only attracts a certain type of adult. The MN wild league certainly has it's share of \"still living in a trailer near my parents and re-living my high school glory days\" guys... and they all seem to be pricks. [deleted]: By scarecrow do you mean the red haired guy with no teeth? I haven\u2019t played in that league since summer 2017, it just wasn\u2019t worth the risk of getting injured because some adults can\u2019t control their temper. Not only that but there are a bunch of Gary-go-hards that make dangerous plays, like trying to get body position on an icing while both players are skating full speed. There\u2019s a way to play competitive hockey without it being dangerous. Also I have to get up for work at 5AM so I\u2019m not trying to play an 11:10 pm game on a Sunday, by the time I get back to Anoka it\u2019s nearly 1AM. <LaconicGirth>: Anoka?
