I am making this post a part of my English 102 paper as a real-life application, and help bring it to the public eye. So what is the Kessler Effect and why should I care about it? Well, the main reason is those magnificent rocket launches and space projects will cease to exist. The Kessler Effect or sometimes known as (Kessler Syndrome) is the growing collision rate of space debris, most prominent in low earth orbit. These collisions are a problem as debris have \u201caveraging speeds of 22,000 mph\u201d (NASA 2017) which are extremely dangerous. For comparison, a sabot round from a tank moves roughly at 5,200 ft/s well above normal gun calibers, while objects in the atmosphere move around 32,000 ft/s. It\u2019s clear that an object no smaller than a baseball can easily damage or completely obliterate a rocket. The chances of destruction increase the more massive the object is, as it has more force. This problem should be addressed early as we can still control the problem because it has not reached the critical amount. Think of the atmosphere being the equivalent of a trashcan and the critical amount being debris. When the trash gets full we take it out or it starts spilling everywhere and makes a mess. So the atmosphere has a set trash limit before problems start occurring. If the limit is reached, the number of collisions in the atmosphere will increase at an exponential rate encasing us in trash. This encasement of debris would make space travel far too risky, as rockets and their payloads have a high chance of collision with foreign debris. With this threat, launches would gradually fade away as the rocket business is not cheap, and sending them up would be a waste of money. The only notable things on the management of the Kessler Effect right now is SpaceX. Their revolutionary reusable boosters help keep a little less litter in space and while saving them a substantial amount of money. Although rockets are not the only victim of the Kessler Effect, satellites are also a major piece in the puzzle. Satellites play a major role in the contribution of to the Kessler Effect as they resemble a double-edged sword. On one edge satellites are highly beneficial to humanity as they serve a wide array of functions, like GPS and weather prediction. Although the other edge of the blade fuels the Kessler Effect. This contribution is caused by deactivated satellites, as they no longer have the ability to perform evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision. These \u201cdead\u201d satellites constantly collide with other debris creating more and more debris. Overall the Kessler Effect could serve as a massive barrier to the expansion of our knowledge to the universe. If you like cell reception or streaming services you should be worried. In conclusion, if want to learn more about it just look it up, it\u2019s fairly new so not too many articles will be on it. Corbett, J. (2015, September 17).

I was thinking it would have to be strictly capture and return. Maybe something like a squad of the X-37s to stay in orbit long term, essentially maneuvering around scooping up objects then jettisoning them back to the ground? Again a long term effort due to the millions of dangerous objects right?<fearlessnetwork21>: Why not simply push them out or back in? :O That's what she said? No, but for real. Is there no way to land on a satellite and attach some type of thruster thingy and then aim it away from its prior course? <EmptyRamenBowl>: This would be a bit cost inefficient, as sending something up for the sole purpose of bringing back down would be a waste of money. Current research shows lasers and some sort of capturing system are the best solutions.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 5.1666666667}

It's not quite your own personal X-15 flight but it's getting there. <nokianich>: Keep in mind how much are first-class ticket on a plane so $250k not really much<makoman115>: First class tickets are like a 2-20 grand depending on distance and timing Sooooo it\u2019s a lot more than that<Acepox>: Think about it. &amp;#x200B; If you can afford to fly first class, paying 20k$ for half a day of flight, you can definitely afford to spend 12 times that for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.<CaptWoodrowCall>: I could afford to fly first class to most places if I really wanted to. (Not $20k, but $3-5k, which is what most first class tickets cost in my experience) I could not, however, just whip out my checkbook and pay $250k to fly to the edge of space. There is a huge difference. <xkegsx>: &gt;if I really wanted to I think the previous poster meant people that only fly first class and do so regularly. I'm sure a lot of people could take out a good chunk of their savings and fly first class if they really wanted to.<hahaigotkilled>: That's how I took it too. But the point is moot either way in my opinion. First class tickets on airlines are going to be dirt cheap once sub-orbital flights become common, so it's all a matter of perspective IMO.<Theycallmelizardboy>: Except aside from the experience of being in space, you're not really doing anything. You're literally just there for the experience. People fly in planes to get from point A to point B. This is more of a luxury that a service.<hahaigotkilled>: You're completely right, but the same thing could of been said about regular flight 100 years ago. Oh, you're just a few hundred feet above the ground, you can still just take a train. It's missing the point if you ask me.<Theycallmelizardboy>: Well in how much time we are talking about here? I mean, you and I are going to be long dead before space flights become commercial. They aren't going to be used for anything other than \"visiting space\".<hahaigotkilled>: I'm obviously no clairvoyant but I'd guess that within 20 years we'll have the capacity for manned sub-orbital flights with reusable spacecraft. It's a challenge that is well within our reach at this point, it's really just a matter of the right people getting funding and a decade or so of development and testing, and another decade of refinement, before the technology comes into the mainstream. Absolutely nothing about reusable SSTOs is outside of our technological capability right now, it's just a matter of bringing the costs down to commercially viable levels.<Theycallmelizardboy>: I mean how economical are they though? I'm not trying to argue, I'm geniunely curious. Because it seems with the amount of fuel and resources that it would take for even sub orbital flights isn't superior of getting from point A to point B.<PrimeLegionnaire>: Sub orbital flights can put airline travel times in the dirt though. It's gonna start just like planes did, high power executives will have their companies foot the bill to get to business deals faster than the competition.<Theycallmelizardboy>: I mean even with the prelaunch and landing? The longest flight in the world is under 18 hrs. If all conditions were perfectly met, a suborbital flight might be able to reach locations in just a few hrs but I'm wondering what the difference would be other than just reaching point B faster. As in, what purpose would this serve with a discrepancy of a few hrs. Medical transportation? I'm asking what the actual benefits would be. &amp;#x200B;<PrimeLegionnaire>: The difference between a normal plane and a Concorde was big enough that if Sonic booms didn't prevent over land travel it would have beat out traditional airlines. Spaceships don't have the problem of a Sonic boom over populated areas.<billthedwarf>: For that we should focus on low boom super sonic flight.<PrimeLegionnaire>: It's not a very promising avenue. The quiet spike is pretty cool, but even suppressed the planes still made a Sonic boom. Rockets promise a theoretical ~90 travel time to anywhere.<billthedwarf>: Low boom planes have promised books about as loud as a car door closing when percieved by people on the ground. Also when talking about loud noise, a rocket launch would have to be far enough away from major populated centers because those are extremely loud. Then, in order to fly somewhere, you would have to drive to a rocket airport like thing and then fly in the rocket, before having to rent a car or take public transportation to your final destination. With low sonic boom planes, you could have planes going into airports such as DCA that are right in the city.<PrimeLegionnaire>: &gt;Then, in order to fly somewhere, you would have to drive to a rocket airport like thing and then fly in the rocket, before having to rent a car or take public transportation Congratulations you have described airports. Why exactly is this a strike against rockets? You have to do this with every single flying transport method as well as a few land based ones (trains) and boats. &gt;With low sonic boom planes, you could have planes going into airports such as DCA that are right in the city. For more cost and less speed of travel. Rockets promise a theoretical ~90 minute trip to any location on Earth, and don't have to land at airports. <billthedwarf>: Sorry I should have phrased that better. I meant that you would have to go farther because rockets are significantly louder taking off and a rocket launch has to have a lot of space for heat. Sure a plane makes noise but it is significantly lower. <Edit>: could you also explain what you mean by \"doesn't have to land at airports\"? I'm not trying to dispute it but I don't understand what you mean.<PrimeLegionnaire>: So I can drive 20 minutes to the airport and take an 18 hour flight (longest flight I know of) or I can drive 40 minutes to the rocket port and be touching down ~2hrs later. Even with 3hrs of driving its going to be drastically faster for global travel. It seems like a no brainier. the main obstacle right now is launch costs and limited launch sites, but both of those problems affected early airlines.<billthedwarf>: This isn't a low boom flight but boom supersonic lists Sydney to LA, a 15 hour flight on a standard airliner, as 6:45 minutes. I'm not saying this is true for everyone but a 2 hour space flight plus 6 hours of driving (3 hours each location) is longer than a 30 minute drive to a airport each way and a flight <PrimeLegionnaire>: &gt;3 hours each location You don't have to land at a spaceport. You can land at basically any runway and even a few spots that are no good for airplanes. <billthedwarf>: And then the whole rocket has to be transported to a new launch site?<PrimeLegionnaire>: No? You don't land with a whole rocket. If SpaceX has it's way the launch vehicle will be back at the pad refuelling. Moving the crew parts of a launch vehicle is already something we do, look at how the shuttle worked.<billthedwarf>: IIRC the space shuttle took a lot longer than preparing for a commercial flight. Also I'm not trying to say that using space flight for transportation around the Earth is a bad thing, I just don't think we should dismiss the much nearer low boom supersonic jets.", "num_messages": 29, "avg_score": 2474.6896551724}

A red giant (surface temperature of about 3.000 K) would have the peak of the emission at a wavelength of about 1000 nm (infrared region then), while blue stars (with a surface temperature of 30.000 K or more) would have the peak of emission at the wavelength of just 96 nm (ultraviolet region). These calculations has been made according to the Wien Law assuming that stars can be considered black bodies (ideal objects that have the maximum emission associated to their temperature) and that life could be sustained around stars different than our sun. The general reasoning should be valid even if this assumptions are not 100% correct. Feel free to correct me if I have made any errors in my reasoning. <TizardPaperclip>: You're missing two key limiting parameters: 1. Most (all?) animal visual systems rely on the breakdown of chemicals by ionization. The lowest frequency with enough energy to ionize molecules is around 400 THz (red). 2. The highest frequency that isn't hazardous to delicate molecules, such as those involved in light sensing, is no higher than 1000 THz (ultraviolet). So any vision system that could work outside those parameters would have to operate on a different principle. <winterfresh0>: Don't some snakes \"see\" infrared by using heat sensing hollows in their face? <Edit>: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_sensing_in_snakes &gt;In spite of its detection of infrared light, the infrared detection mechanism is not similar to photoreceptors - while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the pits of snakes is a type of transient receptor potential channel, TRPA1 which is a temperature sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than chemical reaction to light. Edit 2: I'm not sure if this part is relevant, it's just interesting &gt;It has been found that the snake\u2019s visual and infrared maps of the world are overlaid in the optic tectum. This combined information is relayed via the tectum to the forebrain.<EnclaveHunter>: Hold on. So they see an animal in infrared through warming up the pits in their face with the heat bouncing off the animal? What the fuck<winterfresh0>: It's basically always sensing the temperature of that membrane in the pit, to a very high degree of precision. When an animal goes in front of it, the radiant body heat is enough to warm that membrane just enough to be sensed by those nerves. The shape allows it to work like a rudimentary pinhole camera. You could also think of it like this. You know how you can feel the radiating heat from a fire or oven on your face? They can basically do that with stuff that's not nearly that hot, and they can tell exactly where/what it's coming from. <Threat-Level--12am>: So if I open the open when I'm cooking a pizza, I just feel a bunch of heat on my face, but a snake could tell me how many pepperonis are on the pizza?<BeesOfWar>: Yes because the snake made that pizza specially for you! &lt;3<PapaSnork>: Can I just say how much of a pleasure it is to ponder both the possible vision systems of organisms adapted to life on a planet orbiting a red dwarf, and snakes making pizza?", "num_messages": 8, "avg_score": 118.25}

It'll be more informative if you can pick your way through the math, but it usually isn't essential. I did a lot of reading for meteorite behavior in atmosphere, and average rates of meteorites per year. I had some difficulties with the math, but eventually parsed my way through it well enough to write small programs that gave reasonable results based on their summaries. <Why>: A superhero game where one of the players is a physicist peripherally involved with LIGO. You like to have your science relatively straight before you use it in game. We even got to calculating the effects of a near light speed tungsten dart of the sort you throw in a pub. What sort of fusion/fission products would you get; before the GM pointed out that (a) he wasn't going to give us nuclear darts, and (b) as soon as the dart left his hand the explosion would happen. He'd be the only character left alive because only he stood any chance of out running the blast.<NearABE>: So what spalls off of tungsten-nitrogen? <spindizzy_wizard>: Remember, I'm not a physicist, but I was talking with one about this, and that I made LOTS of simplifying assumptions to keep the process within my reach. I also misremembered what we were doing, it wasn't a tungsten dart, it was a rock (SiO2), so I've had to work through the same process for tungsten-nitrogen. When you fuse tungsten and nitrogen: * Copper 61 * 19.9 MeV Decay products of Copper 61: * Half life: 3.3 h * Neutron + Nitrogen 60 (stable) Because of the half-life, you can basically ignore the decay products because the next iteration will happen before any significant portion of the Cu-61 decays. Since I chose an iteration of 1 second, another simplifying assumption was that you don't have to consider decay products until the half-life is two seconds or less. Considering only the nitrogen branch: * Iteration 2: 75% of Cu-61 is converted to Kr-75 (radioactive, half-life 4.3 min, 9 MeV); * Iteration 3: Tc-89 (radioactive, half-life 12.8 sec, MeV 5.9). * And so on. Did you notice the MeV numbers? This is the amount of energy released during the fusion operation. That energy becomes available to drive further fusion, but as you work your way up the atomic masses, you eventually reach a point (around iron) where it costs you more energy to achieve fusion than you get from the fusion. How long fusion continues depends on the excess energy you've built up from earlier, and what energy starts getting released from fission of radioactive isotopes with sub-second half-lives. As with the XKCD example of a baseball, the dart becomes effectively a point of plasma, which turns into an expanding wave of radiation and blast effects. I didn't get around to calculating at what distance that would happen for the rock, because whatever it was, no one other than the fellow throwing the rock had any chance of survival; and that was only because he had the 'no physics' benefit, which allowed him to run FTL, thus escaping the radiation and blast wave.<NearABE>: Titanium dart? <spindizzy_wizard>: Sorry, but at this point I think you should start looking into it for yourself. \ud83d\ude01 Primary sources of information Wikipedia \"isotopes of X\" and the following web application: <http>://nrv.jinr.ru/nrv/webnrv/qcalc/ Good Luck!

Venus is an interesting place. My favorite thing about it is that if a base could somehow be established in the clouds there the flight time for missions to other parts of the solar system would be shorter.<ThatAnnoyingDutchGuy>: It would make no sense to use Venus for that... it's an inner planet. Only if you'd like to go to mercury this perhaps could be an option, but it wouldn't give you more time. Easiest way is just use it as a gravity assist. <LurkerInSpace>: The attraction is that it reduces the time between launch windows - the Venus to Mars launch window happens every 11 months instead of every 26 for example. A *well-developed* colony on Venus would complement one on Mars or in the asteroid belt as a result. The problem with Venus, though, is that there's not really any incremental benefits to setting up a colony - it's useful when it's big and can build things like nuclear rockets, but not really before that. I'm not even sure how one could do a flag-planting mission there without a nuclear rocket - the delta-V requirements are so large that chemical rockets seem insufficient. Still, it would be good to see more missions to the planet - just not anything that we'd want to bring back! Putting a balloon carrying a probe, or even a solar power plane would be an interesting mission.<kabloems>: I guess if we were to build a flying basecamp in the clouds, flag planting would be much easier. From a cloud base, you still need lots of delta v to reach orbit, but in a more reasonable range of 8-10 km/s. The ground would be reachable with conventional means like helicopters or balloons.<LurkerInSpace>: That's how it would need to be done, which is why I favour Mars first. With a large Mars colony capable of building and launching its own rockets it would be much more feasible to build a base before sending any humans - since a pre-existing base would be needed to actually leave (and nuclear rockets would be helpful). The travel to and from the surface from the cloud base would still be a bit unconventional though - whatever method gets used needs to resist 90 bars of pressure and carry all of its oxidiser as well as fuel!

Ask away! <Joonicks>: Why isnt the fairing filled with low pressure (like, &lt;0.5 ATM) instead of being left open to interact with the atmosphere? Or maybe even hydrogen, considering a rocket is literally a big bomb anyways. It would reduce the launch weight (and helium is cheaper than $1000-to-orbit). Most significantly maybe, it would vastly reduce sonic vibrations in the payload. Drawbacks... helium/hydrogen could seep into sensitive electronics (but would probably seep back out quickly after reaching orbit). Difficult to make the fairing air tight?<lutusp>: The problems that would be caused by having the fairing at a different pressure, or filled with hydrogen, would likely make this riskier than not doing it. Spacecraft should be as simple as they can be, but no simpler, even if this sometimes means taking a pass on an optimization that might introduce new risks. <Joonicks>: Hmmm... Im not so sure... In human rated it might be \"avoid risk at all costs\" but not so with unmanned. Reusability is a huge risk and adds lots of complexity and probably extra points of failure, but SpaceX still did it. Simply reducing the air with helium at sea level pressure would decrease the \"payload\" up to the point of booster separation by 200kg+ Using helium would significantly reduce soundwave energy, which is an actual hazard to the payload. Lowering the pressure amplifies both these benefits and the risk is probably quantifiable. The pressure only needs to be lowered for maybe 30 seconds as well.<lutusp>: I immediately thought of the implosion risk to the craft and payload if the reduced pressure option was in place. And for the other options I don't think the fairing should be airtight. Can you guess why it cannot be airtight? Think about the pressure changes it would encounter during launch, after which it would probably explode with a differential of 14.7 PSI. BTW I have some spacecraft design experience -- I designed part of the NASA Space Shuttle.<Joonicks>: Id imagine having equilibrium ports opening at the appropriate time would be rather simple. Emergency relief valves as backup. Sudden drops in pressure would be unwanted. The pressure isnt the main idea though, its the helium. The thing I like about it is that it both lowers the mass and reduces the energy of sonic waves just by being there. Shuttle design is cool. Actual design or manufacturing/construction work?<lutusp>: &gt; Id imagine having equilibrium ports opening at the appropriate time would be rather simple. Yes, but to assure a successful launch with no extra massive and complex equipment, how about not doing it at all? &gt; Emergency relief valves as backup. Extra mass, extra complexity. Both work against reliable launches. &gt; The pressure isnt the main idea though, its the helium. A pressurized fairing would explode just as violently if filled with helium as with air. And the fairing does have to open, and when it does, the pressure differential must be zero. The easy way to assure a zero pressure differential is not to pressurize it. &gt; Actual design or manufacturing/construction work? Electronic designs. High-efficiency, man-rated solid-state inverters used throughout the fleet. <Joonicks>: &gt; A pressurized fairing would explode just as violently if filled with helium as with air. And the fairing does have to open, and when it does, the pressure differential must be zero. The easy way to assure a zero pressure differential is not to pressurize it. You dont need to pressurize it to get the benefits. Inject it at the tip, the air is forced out at the bottom. Nothing else required, mass is saved and sound supressed. <lutusp>: &gt; You dont need to pressurize it to get the benefits. Of course you do. Think about what happens when the craft ascends and the fairing is not sealed against entering air, and the craft approaches the speed of sound.<Joonicks>: If its not air tight at the top it'd be a pretty shitty fairing. If air was allowed to blow through the fairing unimpeded you have bigger problems....<lutusp>: &gt; If its not air tight at the top it'd be a pretty shitty fairing. Airtight is airtight. One cannot have a fairing that's airtight only in some places, especially at supersonic speed. Therefore current fairings aren't airtight. They cannot be airtight and still meet their design requirements. In any case, airtight or not, a fairing cannot contain helium, because helium attacks integrated circuits. [If Your iPhone Stops Working, You Might Want To Check For Helium Gas Leak!](https://fossbytes.com/apple-devices-break-down-after-exposing-to-helium-gas/)<Joonicks>: your version of a fairing sounds like the inside is a wind tunnel with supersonic winds blowing through it. as the whole purpose of a fairing is to reduce drag and protect the payload from the outside environment, your wind tunnel fairing sounds very ill suited. so your expertise is in electronic engineering, or do you have any actual experience with fairing design? a fairing only needs small holes in hidden away places to allow the inside atmosphere to escape while it ascends, you know that right? such holes could even be outfitted with valves to minimize outside air influencing inside environment. and if you necessarily require no moving parts, etc, then put in tesla valves. &gt; because helium attacks integrated circuits. false. helium interferes with vacuum-dependent enclosed microscopic silicon oscillators. over a time period of 30+ minutes. as an electronic engineer, I hope you know that. If you want to make a point of it, name one more common component that dies in the presence of helium.<lutusp>: &gt; your version of a fairing sounds like the inside is a wind tunnel with supersonic winds blowing through it. That's not my version, that's what a fairing is -- it must withstand that environment. It cannot be airtight, it cannot contain helium. This conversation just ended. <Joonicks>: I see.

I think this is less about American exceptionalism and more about lining pockets. The old phrase holds true: follow the money. The first time I heard about this ludicrous Space Force, I immediately thought, \"Well, okay: that's another 100 billion dollars every year of tax money that isn't going to something useful\". American exceptionalism is an issue, but the American military industrial complex is a much more 'Occam's Razor' solution. Especially when the loudest voice - Trump - is a dyed-in-the-wool businessman. In other words, I don't think the people calling for this are genuinely interested in keeping America safe; I think they're only concerned about their own financial interests. Of course, regardless of where this is coming from, other countries will certainly see it as American exceptionalism, and will respond accordingly... as you said, dick-measuring.<Posca1>: I think your understanding of what the Space Force will be is flawed. This 2017 article, from long before Trump ever heard of the proposal, should shed some light<https>://www.cbsnews.com/news/congress-aims-to-develop-new-military-space-corps-branch/ [deleted]: I really don't understand why this is such a contraversial issue. It will happen eventually as the USAFSPC, SMDC, and the NSC continues to grow. Not long from now the growth of all the programs will get unsustainable and it will need a new branch. Better to do it now before shit gets wasteful funding and disorganized <Posca1>: I think the size of the force is too small right now to make sense. It would only be around 24,000 personnel. That's too small to be a separate service. If the issue that's driving this is the need to protect space budgets from raiding by Big Air Force, that can be easily accomplished by legislation. But, yeah, eventually this will happen. People are up in arms because, let's face it, \"Space Force\" sounds a bit silly. Combine that with everyone thinking Trump came up with this (and he is not really that smart a guy), plus not really knowing what it would entail (\"oh, it must be building spaceships, and space marines, and putting weapons in space\") [deleted]: See my comment above about the name. I think that's pretty reasonable considering it pays homage to how the Air Force formed. Personally, I think US Space Command sounds cooler though. As for the size; I agree it would be a small brqnch, but it's better to form a branch when it's small rather than waiting until the various programs become too big to run effectively. That'd keep wasteful spending down<Posca1>: &gt; Personally, I think US Space Command sounds cooler though. Well, you're in luck then, as the Command is being brought back to life <https>://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Command<DanaEn803>: That is the biggest problem, the Navy does things our way, Air Force does their thing, and Army does their thing with very little coordination from development to operations to basic procedures between the branches. They are turning Space Command into a Warfare Commander equal to CENTCOM or PACCOM, in Cyber Attacks or direct physical attacks on Satellites he will be the one responsible for a coordinated response. Space Force if created will be a compilation of the personnel with standard training and advancement. Then you will have Development and Acquisitions that will happen as a coordinated entity between the branches so each Branch isn't duplicating the efforts of the other branches. The initial consolidation they are doing now will help smooth things out even if the actual Space Force Branch is never created and becomes a Space Corps under the Air Force with a similar relationship to the Navy and Marine Corps under the Dept of the Navy.", "num_messages": 9, "avg_score": 8.2222222222}

I have this conversation with people all the time who've watched way too many movies that think light speed travel is 'right around the corner', its not (my personal opinion is we'll never get that fast). And even if it was, at light speed it would be 5 years travel time to the nearest star assuming you could speed up and slow down instantly.. people just think Im lying.<Hi_Im_Wall>: It's sort of my personal theory that right now Humans are going through the Great Filter part of the Fermi Paradox. If we managed to make it another 1000 years I think that eventually we'll crack something in the regard of, if not light speed or faster, at least something crazy effective. If you look back across all of human history we're actually super good at disregarding the limits that nature intended for us. Between boats, trains, plains, oh my, medical advances, technological leaps, knowledge increases at an exponential rate. It look less than one human life time to go from the first airplane to landing on the moon. Maybe I'm the optimistic type, but I don't see a future where some stubborn and brilliant peoples don't find a way to get past the light speed barrier too<SetBrainInCmplxPlane>: Speed of light isn't a technological barrier. It is **fundamental**. Anything going faster the the speed of light would have effects literally happen before causes. The speed of light is actually the speed of causality and will never ever be broken.<StaticMeshMover>: That's only if you assume a theory to be 100% correct...... Which you really shouldn't or else it wouldn't still be a theory.<SetBrainInCmplxPlane>: I don't think you know what the word \"theory\" is.<StaticMeshMover>: Please enlighten me then oh wise one....<mcochran1998>: Not the person you responded to but I'll anwer anyways. Theory has a layman's definition and a scientific definition. The layman's version is that of speculation or a hypothesis. The scientific version is different. A scientific theory is an attempt at explaining the observations made about our universe. It isn't a theory unless it provides a means of falsification, meaning it should make predictions about what will happen in a given system. A theory has to explain the observations &amp; if the results of experiments don't match the predictions then the theory needs to be amended. All of our observations have pointed to light being the fastest thing in the universe &amp; it's rate of speed is constant. Nothing has been discovered to upset our understanding of this. We would need to be fundamentally wrong about physics to be able to go faster than light. We are not fundamentally wrong, if we are then you're receiving this message on a magic machine. What we can do is learn how to warp space. What we know says that gravity can warp space-time &amp; we could in theory create a gravity well to shorten the space we'd be traveling through. Who needs to go faster than light if you can create a shortcut through space? The energy requirements are the real problem in this scenario.<Suspicious_Code>: &gt; We are not fundamentally wrong Not the person you replied to either, but you lost me here. Saying \"we are not wrong\" goes against everything science stands for. At best, we can say that nothing we've observed or measured up to this point has given us any reason to believe that we are wrong. But we still very well may be wrong.<mcochran1998>: I get what you're saying but it's a matter of refinement, not the kind of upheaval something like traveling faster than light would imply. You're right that in science it's levels of confidence and never absolute certainty but we would have to be more wrong than Newton was compared to Einstein if things can go faster than light. In science we always progress towards less wrong. Given what our current understanding sits at, the technology that we produce as a byproduct being testament to our understanding and manipulation of our reality. Either we aren't fundamentally wrong, or every electronic device is magic. <StaticMeshMover>: \"In science we always progress towards less wrong.\" This is exactly what I'm saying. The problem is you say that then contridict yourself by claiming that means we must have everything correct. No one is saying all the things we know are incorrect, like the science that makes our phones work. All I'm saying is we don't know anything for sure. We are only less wrong. We could discover anything in the years to come.<mcochran1998>: Fundamentally wrong would imply that we are wrong about everything. Me saying that we aren't fundamentally wrong doesn't imply that we don't have things wrong with our models of physics. It does imply that we are on the right trail. <ThePoultryWhisperer>: No it doesn\u2019t. You can easily be fundamentally wrong about something and still use what you think you know to make progress. One day, you find the right piece of data to clarify everything and you have an entirely new theory. Thinking that can\u2019t happen is _fundamentally_ arrogant and unscientific. I say this as someone who uses physics and engineering on a daily basis specifically for non-terrestrial communication. We do the best we can with the information we currently have while continuing to refine our current theories. That does not mean they are infallible in any sense of the word. It\u2019s unlikely given the wealth of data and experimental repeatability, but everything could change when we sample the inside of a black hole, for example. Is it impossible? Maybe, but we have overcome impossible many times in the past. Calling this a fundamental, impenetrable barrier is arrogant at best as if we know enough to know anything fundamental about the universe yet.<StaticMeshMover>: Thank you for helping try to explain how simple science works to this guy. I don't understand how people can think they know or are into real science but then are still close minded. I'm no real scientist myself but at least I take the time to understand the simple concepts of it like what a theory is. Still can't believe he tried to tell me a theory in science somehow has a vastly different meaning and somehow means that thing is \"fundamentally\" correct.

If we are so terrible at doing our job to keep Earth as sustainable as possible for the entire human species and all the different species that exist on Earth, is it possible that we will not do a good job at managing an efficient and sustainable colony? And if we do find and manage to come into contact with other species on Mars, whether they are microscopic or not, will our species cause huge irreparable damage to the ecosystems that are on Mars?

I think that the last few centuries have been focused on competitive development based on the idea that the world will just deal with what we are doing.

We've only just started trying, in earnest, to create sustainable solutions that provide an acceptable standard of living. Have we gone too close to the edge to pull back? I don't know, but I feel like (finally!) this is a mainstream idea and that we are going to give it a go. <Relaxed_Engineer>: &gt; My question to you is: Do you think we've really tried? No. That's my point. We've yet to figure out how to sustainably manage and be good stewards to our relatively hospitable home planet.

[deleted]: Are you absolutely sure what you said is fact or are you speculating?<Cethinn>: I'm sure. In order to \"stop\" an object and bring it to the magnet it would need to be strong enough to counter its current momentum. Unless they are really close and near the same velocity you would need a really strong magnet to have a large enough field to pull stuff in. Also, since energy is conserved, the magnet would change velocity by the difference in velocity of the newly captured object. A magnet could be used to gather the material up, but it would be a part of a larger craft that flies to debris first.

Making, flying, and landing a rocket is incredibly *incredibly* difficult, but even the smallest most basic colony on another planetary body dwarfs the challenge of rocketry. Mars is not an easy place for Humans to survive by any means and the tech to do so is going to be extravagantly expensive. The creation of a Mars colony may easily dwarf the cost of the ISS and the Apollo program and likely can't be done by any single company or country. This stuff is going to have to be a pretty major joint effort if it's going to work and will take quite a while to develop the technology.<Senn5>: Even though I agree what most people don't get is that under the best conditions 4 years for SpaceX to get a probe on Mars is really optimistic [deleted]: I'd say a probe is realistically doable in that time assuming their Starship plans continue on-track and don't suffer from feature-creep. I'd question how advanced the probe might be, but that ventures into speculation since SpaceX probably won't be building probes, only transporting them. Even the Falcon Heavy should currently be capable of putting a probe on Mars under an efficient transfer window. Iirc, the Falcon Heavy has a 40,000lb payload limit for a Mars transfer which I'd assume would allow a large enough stage to land a decently sized probe. <Senn5>: That sounds fair. My only rebuttal is that the whole conversation here is about nothing Elon Musk dates staying on track. Personally I don't think ~~BFR~~ Starship will stay on track [deleted]: (Also, see my edit above. SpaceX probably already has the capability to put probes on Mars without the BFR) I think the manned portion of the BFR project will get delayed a bunch, but they'll be pushing their engineers pretty damn hard and may stay moderately on-track with the unmanned portion. I think the biggest factor here is whether or not they'll have sufficient funding to stay on track, which I think they may get thanks to Starlink and investor optimism. <Senn5>: I can agree with that, just that money may not be the limiting factor.

But we could never get anything nearly this high on Earth basically because of erosion. Shield volcanoes form by a cycle of eruptions, lava flowing down, then cooling off and hardening. Do that thousands of times and you'll get a big build up. But on Earth we have two things that disrupt landforms that Mars doesn't--water and tectonics. Tectonics move shit around, sometimes thrusting land upwards like the Himalayas, and other times tearing shit apart like the crack in the middle of Africa. Water is the real key though--we have wind and snow and ice and rain, freezes and thaws, all of which slowly chip away at mountains. The Appalachians for example used to be as high as the Alps but that was hundreds of millions of years ago. They're some of the oldest mountains on Earth and the reason they're quite a bit shorter than the Alps and Rockies today is because they've been exposed to so much erosion (which also explains why they're much more 'rounded' than the more jagged Rockies and Alps). Mars has none of this, so Olympus gets to erupt, spew lava out and build up without any of the forces that tear shit down. So as long as we got water we'll never be able to come close to building something that high on Earth.<Sionn3039>: Doesn't gravity play a factor as well?<invertedshamrock>: I suppose so yeah, but I think whatever extent to which it does would be minor compared to erosion and tectonics.

There will be exercise and communal spaces on the ship just like there is on the ISS and alot of the stuff we've learnt from long term mirco-g habitation on the ISS will be applied to helping keep people healthy on the trip.

They can also download new stuff from Earth though it would be slower than downloading things here (dependent on your internet connection). 3)We can use electromagnetic waves (usually radio or laser) to send information back and forth and there is already a network of satellites settup to allow the commutation from deep space and interplanetary probes back and forth from Earth. Since things are soo far away though there is a time delay since these communications only travel at the speed of light (its about an average of 8 min to Mars at light speed) Though if we send lots of people to Mars we will probably need to upgrade this system to meet the demand for communication back and forth. 4) Likely we will send pre built habitation modules that will be pressurized and might have green houses attached to supplement the food and water supplys sent with the people (think the Martian style). Alot of this will probably be sent of unmanned missions before we send people. 5) If something happens on Earth well there's not much they can do. depending on how self-sufficient they are they will either run out of supplies then die or keep on living and try and make new civilization on Mars.

Because there is no air or resistance in space, if we could travel the speed of light wouldn\u2019t the spaceship still be fine? <TheRamiRocketMan>: The issue with light-speed travel isn't air-resistance it's physics. It is literally impossible to make anything with mass travel the speed of light or faster. That-said, even if it were possible you'd have a major problem with interstellar dust. Colliding with even a single tiny particle like a grain of sand could be devastating for a spacecraft travelling close to the speed of light because of the amount of kinetic energy involved.<Brvndvnmw>: This is a big eye opener, in videos they never give the reason they just say it\u2019s impossible but now I know! Thank you. <BG_Misonary>: &gt;This is a big eye opener, in videos they never give the reason they just say it\u2019s impossible but now I know! Potential collision with dust is not the thing that makes going the speed light impossible. Were that the case you could, in a literal sense go that fast. What keeps things from going the speed of light is that the faster an object goes the more massive it becomes, at the speed of light an object would have an an infinite amount of mass which would require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate any more.<soadinc>: Firgive me if this is a silly question, but why is the mass of a photon constant (or is it constant?) travelling at its speed? Is it due to not having to accelerate to that speed? Or am i getting this completely wrong<BG_Misonary>: &gt;Firgive me if this is a silly question, but why is the mass of a photon constant (or is it constant?) travelling at its speed?

We call this Planetary Protection, and in fact there is a Planetary Protection Officer at NASA whose job it is to oversee all of this. For our project specifically, we use the same approach MSL used for the Curiosity rover to clean spacecraft parts before, during, and/or after assembly, and then to collect \"swabs\" that are analyzed for microorganisms. We pay special attention to what we call \"spore forming\" organisms (e.g. Bacillus) -- these organisms can survive environmental extremes like heat and radiation that would kill most other living things, and thus these are the most likely to survive a trip to Mars. We pay attention to all the organisms, but we track the spore formers specifically and keep them below a tight lower limit. It's not currently possible to completely sterilize a spacecraft as complex and capable as Mars 2020 without destroying it, so we work very hard to get what we call the \"bioburden\" down to a very low level that we do not believe will affect our ability to do astrobiology at Mars during our mission and in the future.<mattd1zzl3>: How do you feel about the possibility of dozens of humans possibly being on mars in the next decade, dumping bags of human waste on the surface after all this hard work? :)<Blarg_117>: If you think we\u2019ll just dump random waste on the surface of Mars, you have MUCH to learn.<mattd1zzl3>: Here do some learning with this source: https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a13598/is-there-poop-on-the-moon-17630231/ Human spaceflight sites are garbage dumps. Full of discarded experiments, packaging and waste. For the same reason that Mt. Everest is a garbage dump: When you're in mortal danger, ecological protection takes a back-seat.<SpartanJack17>: At the same time, remember the only example of human spaceflight sites are from the 60s and 70s, when concerns like that weren't as prevalent. While you're right that people wouldn't care about ecological protection if they were in danger, I'm not sure that would apply to people in a base on Mars. Yes, if something went wrong they could all die, but that would be unaffected by what they did with their poo. It would be entirely possible to use a system that didn't involve putting it exposed on the surface, and that would have no effect on the dangers of the mission.<mattd1zzl3>: Thats true, but dont forget my Mt Everest point. Go there in 2019 and you're going in a sea of shit, corpses, discarded oxygen bottles, flags, clothing, food wrappers and millenials taking selfies. Exploration is inherently wasteful. Spacex depositing 75 peope on mars on 2 ships (something i see as likely, or at least possible) is going to ruin mars as a pristine, earth-sterile world.<SpartanJack17>: But Mt Everest is almost fully unregulated and visited largely by people with no qualifications or real knowledge of what they should be doing. There's also no alternative there. Making a system for Mars that properly disposed of waste would be easy, and at least at first Mars would be populated by experts who would understand the necessity of keeping i as sterile as possible.

That would be one tiny missile.<I_Automate>: Well, you can fit a 20 kiloton nuke into a 155mm cannon projectile, so it's not like you really need a whole lot of volume. Use the satellite's maneuvering capability to orient the missile and make the munition itself as dumb as possible. No reason to duplicate complex guidance packages when you already have one aboard. Basically just a warhead, a known impulse de-orbit rocket, and enough heat shielding/ airframe to make it through the atmosphere in a sufficiently predictable fashion. <Odd_so_Star_so_Odd>: Have fun aiming and guiding that one \"home\" lol. You could achieve the same from the ground or without flying into space, far far cheaper too.<I_Automate>: Also....not really. A strike from orbit could have much shorter defence response times than one from inside atmosphere. Think the difference between stopping a cruise missile, and stopping incoming ICBM warheads. One is coming in, at best, mach 2 or 3. The other is moving 7+km/s. Entirely different ballgame. Also, getting the warhead on target is not unrealistic. Again, ICBM warheads have had that technology nailed down for decades. All that this idea does is use a satellite as the warhead bus, instead of a dedicated booster <Odd_so_Star_so_Odd>: To deal damage you'd need it to explode in the lower atmosphere and travelling there at that speed isn't possible without the object disintegrating on its own from the forces at play before making any impact or detonation. Either it'll be slowed down or it doesn't make it and either way the shielding would shadow the warhead if you were to try. There's too many challenges and unanswered questions to consider it when we have a better cheaper alternative already. Don't forget as well that there's a very real concern towards keeping space free of weaponry in order to avoid Kessler syndrome.<I_Automate>: While I have no argument against keeping weapons out of space, that won't help if war breaks out. Communication and recon satellites make good targets for ASAT systems. Past that, though.....we already have plenty of experience getting warheads (and people, who are far more fragile) through the atmosphere. Like....lots. Accurately, too. Ever heard of a M.I.R.V.? Or a fractional orbital bombardment system, such as certain variants of the SS-18? Where are you getting your information from? Some reading for you, because I think you have some gaps. <https>://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle <https>://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Orbital_Bombardment_System <https>://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry <https>://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon<Odd_so_Star_so_Odd>: I'm aware, thank you, the point still stands that it's unnecessary and the fact that speed is somehow attractive while we're talking nuclear warheads - it's the least of all to worry about or view as something that is gained instead of added challenge. It takes a lot to put something into orbit and launching a missile that you intend to come down again anyway, it's just much easier and cheaper to have it ready on the ground instead of parked in orbit. When launched you can choose whether you want it to go high into space before coming down or fly across the sky through the atmosphere. Of course it's all MAD and a waste of time and money to have arms races while people suffer and live in fear of the \"other\" while lacking purpose. <I_Automate>: I don't think you understand the basics of modern missile technology, defense systems, or nuclear war in general at all there, stranger. On top of that, this entire thread is concerned with the plausibility of weaponizing a fleet of satellites that you already intend to launch. That scenario kinda implies that you're OK with the extra cost and complexity associated with that. High incoming velocities make warheads more difficult to intercept. There are definite benefits to pre placed warheads in orbit. A ground launched missile can be detected during the boost phase and it's trajectory accurately plotted, while cruise missiles can take hours to reach their targets, allowing your targets to GTFO, and their much lower velocities make intercepts far easier to achieve, to the point where conventional radar controlled guns can do the job in many cases. Orbital weapons can be on-target in minutes or less, with minimal launch signature, very high velocity, and, consequently, very small intercept windows. Those two categories of weapons really don't have much overlap. Cruise missiles are air-breathing, ballistic missiles are not. Again, where are you getting your information? Because....not much of it checks out. Read up on F.O.B.S. They weren't taken out of service because they didn't work. They got taken out because they worked far, far too well for anyone's comfort. <Odd_so_Star_so_Odd>: &gt; They weren't taken out of service because they didn't work. They got taken out because they worked far, far too well for anyone's comfort. Also don't forget you could achieve the same for a fraction of the cost, but altogether it's why even as a plausibility this idea is idiotic and you'd be stupid to want to go back to MAD. Like what are you or this plausibility trying to accomplish? Given my stance I think it's a waste of time to discuss or lend any credence to any of it. Make love not war.<I_Automate>: M.A.D. never went away, and the F.O.B.S. that were developed were based on standard ballistic missiles, basically just with a modified upper stage attached. So, pretty well the same cost as standard delivery systems. Cheaper system costs overall, possibly, because you'd have fewer hostile A.B.M. intercepts, so a higher percentage of your launched warheads could make it to their targets. Also, if you have such an issue with the hypothetical posed here.... why did you even start commenting in this thread, in the first place? YOU brought yourself here, then pretended to be knowledgeable regarding subjects that you obviously don't know much about at all. That isn't my fault. If you can't accept being corrected, or are unwilling to actually back up your arguments, consider maybe not making them in the first place.<Odd_so_Star_so_Odd>: &gt; possibly I don't disagree with you but I think you're the one who has to back up your claims that it's cheaper, if that were the case, it would've happened but since you can't maintain stuff in space like you can on earth, it hasn't. The technical stuff you're so obsessed with is besides the point I'm trying to make and it's pretentious of you to argue I don't know anything when It's you who can't keep up. It's not economically feasible and if we arm space pretty soon there won't be any to worry about or explore.<I_Automate>: You were arguing over technical matters, in a thread ABOUT technical \"what if?\". That was literally the conversation you jumped into. Definitely cheaper, or, at least not much more expensive per unit. Doesn't stay in space, just uses it to get to the target. If you'd read the basic overview I helpfully provided, or even thought about the designation, \"Fractional\" Orbital Bombardment System, that would be clear. But, no. Hop into a technical discussion, pretend to have knowledge, and, when confronted with actual accurate information, try to claim that the conversation never really was about the tech, after all. Typical<Odd_so_Star_so_Odd>: Fine, let's forget the politics and finances then and I'll repeat and elaborate my original comment here: 1m^3 isn't enough to deliver a warhead from space since you need something to steer and have a shield for reentry. You might as well put more warheads inside the big heavy object you end up with, thus getting us what you're so eager to make your point with, except it doesn't prove anything, it just shows what you end up with if you took this idea into reality.<I_Automate>: Your actual re-entry vehicle doesn't have to be all that much larger than about a 6\" artillery shell, including the heat shield. Why do you think it needs to be larger? A 500 kiloton, 2 stage thermonuclear RV is less than 1 cubic meter, and we don't need 500 kilotons, or the ability to withstand being launched from a cannon. Replace the steel case with a heat shield, add a known impulse rocket, sufficient to de-orbit the munition, and you're in business. My original comment also pointed out that you really don't have to steer it. You already have attitude and maneuver thrusters on the satellite bus, as well as telemetry and guidance. Your reentry vehicle could be fully ballistic once its' de-orbit burn is complete. That isn't particularly difficult math to do. We understand ballistics and aerodynamics quite well. I gave my reasoning, now give yours. Why do you think that your RV needs to be massive? The actual \"physics package\" can be as small as a 10\u00d720cm cylinder (possibly smaller, but that's the smallest I've seen in open literature), including the fuzing and arming mechanism. I can give you a source for that. Modern heat shield materials are also pretty amazing stuff, and you wouldn't need it to last long, because you could use a reentry profile that would place unacceptable forces on anything less stoutly put together than something designed to be shot out of a cannon. You'd have to make a bit of room, nothing is free, of course, but it wouldn't take up anywhere near the total volume of the satellite. Call it a cylinder 20 cm wide and a meter long, at the most, including rocket, spin stabilization system, and heat shield.", "num_messages": 14, "avg_score": 2.0}

The old saying \"boys will be boys\" reflects historically forgiving attitudes to the mischief boys would get into, because those troublesome boys would eventually grow up to be highly productive. Science, technology, and industry advanced rapidly, and now that we have it, everyone seems to have forgotten how we got it. Feminism took over the world, and the feminists want what the boys earned. Instead of being forgiving, Mankind now has the prestigious distinction of sending more of its boys to prison than to college. Worse, feminist civilization revels in public shaming, so they're registering the boys in a background check system to permanently block access to education, housing, and employment for the rest of their lives. All that to ensure boys never again compete with feminists for jobs. It's working, and Mankind could be on the verge of extinction because of it, all so some complaining feminists can complain some more about all the endless things they never stop complaining about. &gt; The biggest unknown variable is how long communicable civilizations last on average, This is based on radio SETI, which had its heyday from the 1960's to the 1990's, and is now obsolete. &gt; do we just keep making more and more ways to wipe ourselves out until one finally happens?

The first working radio communication system was invented in 1879 by David Edward Hughes. Early radios all worked on low frequencies that could not penetrate the Earth's ionosphere. High power radio transmissions at higher frequencies did not become common until the 1940's. So, Earth's \"radio diameter\" is usually thought to be around 80 to 100 light years. However, radio SETI is obsolete because we now know there are much easier ways to detect and observe a technological civilization at that range.<TheGreat_Danton>: Not necessarily true, we have been dismissing animal intelligence for sometime because they don't have the same tools we do. Orca whales have been shown to pass down certain hunting techniques in certain pods, whale culture if you will. We're trying to judge an animals intelligence by human standards of the fine articulation and motor skills we have for speech, writing, crafting et cetera. If humans never had evolved opposable thumbs, you might look at them and say that aren't intelligent because they don't use tools, or make art or any of the ear marks we have for ourselves. Language and agriculture seem to be the foundation of society and the group intelligence/info that comes from it. Just like how a computer made of thousands of individual parts (people) is essentially just a paperweight until you give it a power supply (agriculture) and an operating system (language) but once you do the capabilities are near limitless. I think intelligence is advantageous, but the physical adaptions that determine the level at which an organism can take advantage of intelligence are up to chance. With no fine motor skills, orcas can't articulate sounds into different words or create tools or make any mark that won't be washed away. If humans lived underwater with fins and gills, there would be a good chance we'd still be roving in hunter gatherer groups, just like orcas do in pods. While radio based intelligence detection is obsolete, our radio waves are still the farthest information we've sent out. Odds are an advanced civ would have more several more magnitudes of energy at their disposal and gravitational waves would be viable and by far the best bet at long distance communication. With our current level of tech we couldn't detect the remnants after hitting the ionosphere, but I don't think its too far of a stretch to assume an extra-solar species has the capability of distinguishing them from the universal background radiation. Assuming advanced enough tech for our audience, were at around a 150 lyr bubble and big enough that millenials would be around to hear a reply if there is intelligent life in the nearest stars. And I don't know how this became about feminism, but I do believe the pendulum has swung too far and we're now seeing the backlash with trump, proud boys, et. My main issue that men are being blamed for the system (aka patriarchy) while these gender roles were created by SOCIETY, including women. Men didn't beat their wives into subservience until 1000 years ago, love and empathy still existed. These roles constructed are just as damaging to a man's psyche as a woman's independence. There's a reason the suicide rate of men is 4x that of women. There's a reason some little girls with daddy issues end up strippers and some little boys with mommy issues end up serial killers. The fundamental human need of intimacy is (at least perceived to be) in the woman's hands. In general, women are the gatekeepers of relationships. Up until the 20th century, almost all jobs with high enough pay to support a family were physical in nature. A job a woman physically could not do, so she needs a man to support her family and a man needed a wife at home to house keep while he was working all day. It wasn't perfect but it worked and got us where we are today. If we are going to right the injustices, we need to look at the roles that give women privilege just as we have men. But the problem I've found is a lot of soft-core feminists want all the plus sides of gender roles (big, strong, protective and providing man; rock to lean on; choice of mate within your league) while wanting equality in all other areas. Until we start talking about the toll \"the patriarchy\" has taken on men, we're going to keep seeing anger bubble up like this and ignoring the fact that it does is what's causing the anger. I think it boils down to that it is nearly impossible to have a perfect balance of power. The people with the power at any given time will seek to keep it while those without seek change (conservatives vs. progressives) and we're finally getting to the point women have more power in society (a la equality except when it benefits me). But I don't think it means the decline of civilization. The global IQ is still going up and acknowledging men's plight would solve a lot of the anger and discontent stirred up in men today.<badon_>: &gt; I think intelligence is advantageous, but the physical adaptions that determine the level at which an organism can take advantage of intelligence are up to chance. That might be the key defining difference. It's one thing to be smart. It's another to build a technological civilization. Either way, there are still no animals that can compare to human intelligence, even if they do have some tricks of their own that might be impressive. For example, despite all their intelligence, you can't teach an orca enough for them to be able to do things a typical or even bad human student can do. &gt; While radio based intelligence detection is obsolete, our radio waves are still the farthest information we've sent out. Deliberately sent out, yes, but evidence of the presence of a technological civilization on Earth has been visible (at visible wavelengths) for at least a thousand years, and probably much longer than that. &gt; Odds are an advanced civ would have more several more magnitudes of energy at their disposal and gravitational waves would be viable and by far the best bet at long distance communication. I have never heard this before. Why would gravitational waves be better than electromagnetic waves? &gt; I do believe the pendulum has swung too far [...] I think it boils down to that it is nearly impossible to have a perfect balance of power. I personally do not believe harmonious balance is impossible. It's a strong feature of East Asian culture, for example. However, from a fundamental scientific perspective, maybe you're right: * [What if sustainability is an impossible equilibrium (Great Filter) in the universe? - American Astronomical Society : r/GreatFilter](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreatFilter/comments/95m9p8/what_if_sustainability_is_an_impossible/)<TheGreat_Danton>: The gravitational force is so weak that it becomes infinitesimal compared to the other forces. It\u2019s why you can see a star much further outside its sphere of gravitational influence. If you could devise a way to create a directional gravitational wave directed at a star or galaxy (I.e. focus pure energy) they would be detectable as there is virtually no background gravitational waves and local interference can be accounted for by two detectors in different locations. This does take orders of magnitude more energy than we are capable of producing as a species, but that is the one thing we can be fairly sure an advanced species would have. I\u2019d equate to trying to shout to someone on the other side of a lake. There is so much going on in the air (EM spectrum) that no matter how big of a megaphone you build it\u2019s always going to be noisy or borderline destructive. But instead you get a giant hammer and start slamming it into the water. You could communicate through a code of splashes. The wind creates small ripples and disturbances (just like em radiation does in the gravitational field) but is negligible to a large enough splash. Essentially it comes down to the orders of magnitude of the fundamental forces. <badon_>: That sounds like a terrible idea. Gravitational waves being hard to detect doesn't make them superior to electromagnetic waves that are easy to detect. Background noise is not the limiting factor in communicating with electromagnetic waves, and gravity waves have no advantage in terms of noise. In both cases, the limiting factors are output power for the transmitter and collecting area for the receiver. Gravity waves have both of those problems, PLUS the fact they're extremely difficult to detect, and extremely difficult to generate, and they require literally astronomical amounts of energy just to reach the threshold of detectability, without even transmitting any information. I see no advantage to gravity waves for communication. None whatsoever. They fail spectacularly in every category compared to electromagnetic waves. It would be easier to literally communicate with lake splashes, like you described by analogy.<TheGreat_Danton>: The gravitation field does have an advantage when it comes to noise, it is the most consistent and predictable out of all of them. Nothing can decay and appear that will create a meaningful gravitational reading, it\u2019s almost purely deterministic. And background noise is a limiting factor, it what determines your needed power output and receiver size. If there were no background interference you could communicate with a single ray of photons. And it does transmit information. Everything is information. All you need is a protocol and the waves themselves are the info. One wave short and one long, now you\u2019ve got gravitational Morse code. It does take extremely precise and powerful equipment, but once you have the tech it\u2019s trivial and you can have a much cleaner, quieter form of communication. The nature of the universe isn\u2019t going to change much in our time here but our technological precision and power output will almost certainly rise as long as we do. &gt; Background noise is not the limiting factor in communicating with electromagnetic waves, and gravity waves have no advantage in terms of noise. In both cases, the limiting factors are output power for the transmitter and collecting area for the receiver. You made these assertions without evidence or reasoning to back it up or even understanding that the power of the transmitter/sensitivity of the receiver is partially determined by background noise. And it seems your understanding of the principles of wireless communication are shaky at best. Until we can have an evidence based assert and refute discussion, I\u2019m done here. <badon_>: &gt; The gravitation field does have an advantage when it comes to noise, it is the most consistent and predictable out of all of them. I'm skeptical of that. There is plenty of gravitational noise, and some of it is detectable with current technology like gravimeters. &gt; Nothing can decay and appear that will create a meaningful gravitational reading, it\u2019s almost purely deterministic. I'm not sure what you mean by \"decay and appear\". Gravitational fields are constantly changing, just like electromagnetic fields. The difference is electromagnetic fields are much easier to detect at far lower energy requirements. For example, a sensitive gravimeter can detect snow accumulating on a rooftop. To modulate that gravity signal, you would need to rapidly move the matter in that snow to create a gravity wave. Oscillating a few hundred kilograms of snow at a few kilohertz to create gravity waves is much more difficult than oscillating electrons to create electromagnetic waves. You could do it, but why? It would require enormous amounts of energy, and it would be far less detectable at far shorter ranges than electromagnetic energy. The background noise would wipe it out quickly, even if you had a receiver sensitive enough to detect it. &gt; And background noise is a limiting factor, it what determines your needed power output and receiver size. No, that's not how it works. Background noise is negligible compared to path loss. &gt; If there were no background interference you could communicate with a single ray of photons. No, that's not how it works. You CAN communicate with \"a single ray of photons\", but in a focused system like that, background noise is almost completely eliminated. Over long distances, you can still communicate that way, but then the idea of \"a single ray of photons\" loses meaning because of the inverse square law, which says your \"single ray\" will expand to enormous size. In other words, it's not distinguishable from an isotropic radiation pattern. &gt; And it does transmit information. Everything is information. I have no idea what you're talking about. &gt; All you need is a protocol and the waves themselves are the info. One wave short and one long, now you\u2019ve got gravitational Morse code. No, that's not how it works. What you're trying to describe is called modulation. Modulation requires bandwidth. Bandwidth requires power. And Shannon's Law tells us information capacity is dependent on both bandwidth and power. That means, in your example, the best you could do is slow on-off keying, which has a very limited information carrying capacity. If you have to expend many megawatts of power to oscillate hundreds of kilograms of matter, AND then try to modulate it, all just to communicate a few characters per minute or hour over a distance of only 10 meters...that's not very productive. &gt; It does take extremely precise and powerful equipment, but once you have the tech it\u2019s trivial and you can have a much cleaner, quieter form of communication. No, none of that is as simple as you think it is. I don't think anyone realizes it, but we DO have the technology to do this. It's not trivial, and it would not work well. You're right it would require extremely precise and powerful equipment, and you wouldn't get much out of it. I'm not sure what you mean by \"cleaner, quieter form of communication\". It would be probably the worst form of communication ever invented, as far as I can tell. I have no idea what it would be useful for. &gt; You made these assertions without evidence or reasoning to back it up or even understanding that the power of the transmitter/sensitivity of the receiver is partially determined by background noise. If you were as smart as you think you are, you would know free space path loss accounts for far more signal energy requirements than background noise level, especially over long distances: * [free space path loss - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=free+space+path+loss) \"the power of the transmitter/sensitivity of the receiver is partially determined by background noise\" is not correct. In fact, background noise is completely unrelated to those things. You might mean another kind of noise that you're not yet familiar with. &gt; And it seems your understanding of the principles of wireless communication are shaky at best. Compared to who? You? I'm sorry, but I'm not impressed yet. Insult me more. Maybe that will work. &gt; Until we can have an evidence based assert and refute discussion, I\u2019m done here. You're going to have to do that by yourself. I'm not interested.

The fact remains that there is plenty of evidence supporting the idea that intelligence is largely heritable.<Drbillionairehungsly>: I\u2019m sure there is, which is why I asked for sources regarding this.

And then YOU started this conversation between us by not addressing the issue at hand, which is the heritability of intelligence, but instead by passively aggressively insinuating like a little dweeb that I've had \"a rough morning\" or something.

But I feel I would be remiss if I did not try to be the Devil's advocate here: - Laser beam reflectors only proves that a machine (manned or *unmanned*) landed on the Moon. It's not proof of *humans* landing on the Moon. - The photos of the lunar module still being where NASA left it some 60+ years ago are all made by NASA. AKA not a third party observer, and thus could have been faked. All the stories of third party observers claiming plans to photograph the remains of the Apollo missions (f.ex. the VLT) have not resulted in any actual photographs. - The soil samples the astronauts brought back are of the same materials that the earth is made of (the moon was probably created when a large object impacted the early Earth and made it split into the Moon and the Earth; so it's made of the same stuff). So we only have NASAs word for it that the rocks are actually from the Moon. Also, I think there was a story recently about how one of the Moon rocks given to some museum somewhere was actually a petrified piece of wood. I am not a scientists, so I do not have the answers. But I do know that if the Moon landing was a lie, it would be the largest conspiracy ever; involving literally hundreds of thousands of people. I do not for a second think that so many people would be able to keep their stories straight. What I find really odd is that we haven't been back to the Moon since the 1970s. There is a potential military advantage in staying on the Moon and the scientific advantage of being able to create a base there before trying to build one on Mars is surely useful. Also, several billionairs have voiced a deep desire to go to the Moon. Going there today with Today's tech would be much cheaper than going there over 60 years ago. <bearsnchairs>: Chandrayaan 1 imaged the Apollo 15 landing site. <https>://m.phys.org/news/2009-09-indian-satellite-moon-scientist.html Lunar rocks are also covered in micrometeorite impacts that earth rocks aren\u2019t because of the atmosphere. <https>://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/JB076i023p05770 <serialkillerpod>: Just to be a dick: The link doesnt have any photo. Just a guy saying they found it. <itshonestwork>: It\u2019s more than that. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings The clearly manually flown decent footage during the last moments of the Apollo 11 landing matching crater for crater, rock for rock, crater feature for feature with the LRO NAC imagery shows that not only did hardware land on the moon, but human piloted hardware did. The massive quantity of lunar rock returned also shows that it was formed in 1/6th gravity. It may be made of the same \u201cstuff\u201d, but it was clearly not formed in the same way. I know you\u2019re playing devils advocate, but anyone nitpicking over such small things to me is clearly extremely ignorant of the scale of Apollo. It was more than Amstrong and Aldrin landing on the moon. It\u2019s shit loads of photographs and video that is consistent. It\u2019s hours and hours of radio and transcripts that are often mundane and yet still all check out. It\u2019s pages of flight manuals and schematics that all still check out. It\u2019s the hardware that was built and still exists that you can go and see that is completely capable of doing everything claimed of it. It\u2019s tantamount to saying NASA created all the hardware and procedures for landing on the moon, with all the right calculations, trajectories, navigational tools, rocketry, fuel requirements, life support, suits, training and simulators, but then just didn\u2019t go, and somehow invested even more money in faking it, including the physics of how dust being kicked behaves in an era before CGI, that still stands up to scrutiny today, despite how special effects from the best movies of that era\u2014or even 10-15 years ago\u2014have clearly aged. Every PAD, every picture, every bit of maths checks out. For every time they went. To be a \u201csane\u201d and rational hoax believer, you have to acknowledge that NASA worked out exactly how to get to and land on the moon, created all the hardware to do it, trained extensively in how to operate the machinery to do it, worked out every bit of math required, even launched that hardware, but then just didn\u2019t go anyway. Lastly, to wonder why we haven\u2019t been back goes beyond playing devils advocate, and just seems to suggest you don\u2019t know the politics behind why we went in the first place. Satellites and space stations offer far more millitary advantages than being perched on a rock too far away to see anything. <WikiTextBot>: **Third-party evidence for Apollo Moon landings** Third-party evidence for Apollo Moon landings is evidence, or analysis of evidence, about Moon landings that does not come from either NASA or the U.S. government (the first party), or the Apollo Moon landing hoax theorists (the second party).

Let\u2019s do it. By Robert Zubrin &amp; Homer Hickam The Washington Post, 12.10.18 <agate_>: What? Zubrin's pushing for a moon colony? When did he change his tune on that? When I was reading his stuf a decade or two ago, he was adamant that the moon is a trap, a distraction from the goal of getting to Mars. His books were full of good points about how the Moon has damn near zero useful resources for a spacefaring civilization, and isn't even useful as a refueling station, since the fuel you burn to get there is less than the fuel you can pick up. \"Even if there were pre-made cans of rocket fuel sitting on the Moon ready to go\", he'd say, \"it wouldn't be worth stopping to pick them up.\" Ironic to see folks like /u/TheClayrooAtWork criticizing this article using *exactly the same points* Zubrin used to use. Zubrin's at least staying true to form in pushing back against NASA's tendency to do incremental baby steps. Maybe he's decided that if the consensus is that we should do the Moon before Mars, we should at least *actually go to the moon* rather than building a pointless halfway-house.<NorthernRedwood>: Moon is ideal for launching nuclear powered rockets and ships, launching them on earth is not popular, cause if they explode they will spread radioactive material, but on the moon? Who cares!<LurkerInSpace>: As I understand it, one part of why Mars is favoured is that an incremental improvement in a colony's abilities is more feasible. Going from launching pre-made re-usable chemical rockets, to building chemical rockets, to building nuclear rockets is more feasible than skipping to the third step in that. The other part is just that Mars has more stuff for growing food. A colony could try to start on pre-made, re-usable nuclear rockets, but I'm not sure how possible that actually is - or how much fuel gets consumed by a launch. It would be a big ask for a colony to have uranium enrichment facilities right from the start.<SmaugTangent>: Mars is very, very far from Earth in terms of how long it would take a ship to get there in case of emergency. Mars also has much less sunlight than Earth or Luna because it's farther from the Sun. Luna is very close by in case you want to do stuff that's too dangerous to do on Earth, or benefits from a low-g environment (perhaps certain manufacturing processes). For growing food, the Moon is surely better: there's plenty of sunlight, and the only other things you need to provide are water, nutrients, and a habitat with an atmosphere (you don't need soil). It would certainly be much easier to build hydroponic greenhouses on the Moon than on Mars.<LurkerInSpace>: The reduction in sunlight isn't as big a problem as you might think; it's about the same as the sunlight which makes it through the surface of ocean to a depth of 1m - which is obviously enough to grow plants in. The need for nutrients and water is what makes the Moon so difficult; you need to import them from Earth, and you need to keep importing them as the colony grows. With Mars the colony can grow using Martian resources and only rely on Earth for manufactured goods. I agree that the Moon would let us learn more and test the sorts of techniques we'd want to use on Mars anyway - and has its own advantages such as for manufacturing in vacuum. And being close-by is indeed helpful in an emergency. But if we want to go anywhere else in space we'll need ways of coping without that support in any case.<SmaugTangent>: &gt;The need for nutrients and water is what makes the Moon so difficult; you need to import them from Earth That's completely false. Water was discovered on the Moon not long ago, and there's likely a lot of it. For other nutrients, you're probably going to have to import some of those from Earth to Mars as well; it's not like Mars has Earth-normal soil. And you don't need that many nutrients to grow food, and you can recycle them. <LurkerInSpace>: There's about 600 million tonnes of it, which sounds like a lot but is really only the quantity of a small lake - and most of it is craters near the poles. Mars, in contrast, has a quantity of water comparable to Greenland. And while its soil isn't normal the nutrients are there to extract, which is a lot easier than getting them from Earth. Recycling nutrients doesn't help for actually growing the colony - it means that you need to import some everytime a new colonist is added. This is fine at first when every colonist comes from Earth, but it's not sustainable if anyone is born in the colony (which granted, we don't know the viability of that).<SmaugTangent>: &gt;This is fine at first when every colonist comes from Earth, but it's not sustainable if anyone is born in the colony (which granted, we don't know the viability of that). Not only do you not know the viability of that, that's so far in the future that it's not worth worrying about at this point. What's worth worrying about now is: where do we establish our first colony, likely within the next few decades? Moon is close and convenient, and that's what's really important right now. Don't forget, before too long we'll have asteroid mining, so you'll likely be able to get minerals, nutrients, etc. from asteroids; you don't need them to actually be on the surface of whatever body you build a colony on. Longer term, it would make more sense to have colonies in artificial structures in space, rather than on some low-g body. Then you can completely control all the environmental conditions (most especially gravity), which you can't do on a planet or moon. <LurkerInSpace>: If it's an actual colony it absolutely is worth worrying about how it can grow. If it's just a base then the Moon is pretty sensible, but its proximity doesn't necessarily make up for the lack of fuel (though oxidiser is plentiful). Building rotating habitats requires huge quantities of resources - one that had an internal area equal to Singapore would require &gt;40 billion tonnes of material. That can be got from the asteroids, but to get to the point that we're mining such huge quantities we will, in my opinion, need a substantial colony - a country in its own right - on either the Moon or Mars.", "num_messages": 10, "avg_score": 43.0}

When they got into position and tried to use the shears, the foot restraint didn't work. Oleg was flopping all over the place. Sergei ended up having to manually restrain him so he could work. The only nearby tether point was a loop on the fabric exterior. 1. The shears couldn't cut the MLI. Oleg ended up removing it by slashing it with a knife. 1. The process of removing the MLI sent FOD everywhere. It was a mess. 1. They used the knife as a pry bar to get the shears under the MMOD shield. 1. While trying to pry back the MMOD shield, the knife was being flung around, tethered, but unsheathed. Ever play tetherball with a knife? 1. After finally using vice grips to peel back the MMOD shield, they couldn't find the hole! They had missed it by about two inches. 1. Their efforts to grab a sample were less than fruitful. All they managed to grab was some of the epoxy they used to form the patch. If that was what they wanted, they could have easily simulated it in a vacuum chamber on the ground. 1. They got so far behind the timeline that they didn't have time to place any replacement insulation. The bare pressure wall is just hanging out in the breeze for the next week. 1. Information gained from this EVA is unlikely to be useful for any practical operational purpose. Meanwhile, the risks were numerous: increased vulnerability to MMOD and thermal extremes, sharp edge hazards threatening the Orlan suits, a not-insignificant risk of dislodging the patch or creating new, harder-to-repair damage to the pressure wall.

It sounds good, but from a practical perspective the moon doesn't offer us much relative to the trouble of going there and getting up from or down to the surface. Earth orbit is the real start line, and the next logical step after that is to try and obtain then process materials in space. NASA under the Obama administration had a roadmap for capturing, sampling, and even redirecting near-earth asteroids (asteroids \"nearby\" traveling in an orbit effectively parallel to the earth's). THAT'S exciting, THAT makes sense, and that's exactly what's necessary to expand the orbital infrastructure which will be a critical to reduced cost and increased capacity for going everywhere else in the solar system, especially very sensitive and serious undertakings like trying to colonize other planets.

But that's not what scares me. What scares me is that we might encounter an alien intelligence the looks at us the same way that we look at ants. You know, \"oh how cute, look what they're building, they are so industrious. Use that spray and wipe them out.\" Nothing malicious, or mean-spirited, just that we would be so unevolved and primitive to them that we look like insects.<abracatastrophe>: I guess that perspective might arise in beings with a more advanced consciousness. Imo it seems much more likely however that significantly advanced consciousness will have outgrown such rigid hierarchical thinking. Possibly even out of necessity. After all, such a sense of superiority is a mistake in logic based in a popular misconception of evolutionary theory. Much like the abomination that is social Darwinism. Our fear of the alien (terrestrial or not) is more a product of us projecting our own tendency to brutalize the \"other\" than actual likelihood. All said, we simply don't have the means to approximate or accurately theorize on the nature or disposition of a truly alien consciousness. I mean, if an alien consciousness can't express characteristics such as empathy while exploring the unimaginably vast resource pool of space to which it has access, how advanced could it really be? <Edit>: spelling, punctuation<deplorableinWV>: My point is that a sufficiently advanced civilization might not even consider us as thinking sentient beings if we're unable to communicate with them. Ants are an incredibly complex society, they have hierarchy, and they're able to perform magnificant Feats. But we routinely wipe them out because we consider them to be insects. Imagined a race that was capable of interstellar flight, but communicated through smells, instead of sights or sounds. How long would it take us to figure something like that out, figure out how to communicate with them, and then make it understood that we are a species that deserves to survive as well? And then, will they even listen. It wouldn't be anything malicious, it would might simply be seen as Pest Removal. Or we might not even rise to the level of notice. And as far as traveling Interstellar distances. That is not likely to be a scientific endeavor, on the whole. It would likely be an expansion of their culture, race, Empire. The same way we didn't exactly come into North America to destroy everything. Europeans came here to explore and exploit resources. The near total decimation of the native population was mostly an unintended consequence of diseases. Of course there were malicious elements to the occupation of North America, I'm not saying that there wasn't. I'm just sane that the majority of the deaths that occurred were from populations being ravaged by diseases they had no immunity for.<abracatastrophe>: I get what you're saying. But, a significantly advanced consciousness will be capable of relating to simpler life forms. Similar to our ability to anthropomorphize non-humans, yet far far more advanced. Buddhism is an entire religion based upon this capacity for the extension of \"self\", and that was created thousands of years ago by humans less \"advanced\" than us. As far as historical colonization/resource-competition scenarios are concerned, I don't think they apply. We, as simple and inefficient as we are, occupying one little moldy rock around an average star, are capable of synthesizing various forms of exotic matter, ion drives, splitting subatomic particles, bending space-time, etc. All with only a handfull of centuries applying empircal method and industrial technology. It seems like a stretch to me that another sentience more advanced than that would find it worth their time to do anything but observe an inhabited planet. Resource competition will most likely be a non-issue to an interstellar civilization. The building blocks for any resource they might need are in excess abundance in any galaxy. I'm not saying the scenarios you propose aren't possible. Just saying that they exist alongside several other slightly more likely scenarios.<deplorableinWV>: I think perhaps you misunderstand my meaning about resources. As far as Metals, water, and various other materials go the asteroid belt would be a much better solution to Resource acquisition. The resource most likely needed for a civilization traveling Interstellar would be a place to land, and food. Sure, we anthropomorphize animals. But we also eat them. A lot of times you try to kill them as humanely as possible, but we still kill and eat them. We can do this because they don't rise to our level of intelligence, and we consider them not to have souls. Just imagine an Interstellar species that was extremely xenophobic in their views of any other race they encountered.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 1.5}

I\u2019ve listed below the sites I visited, together with some links and practical info for each one. **Baikonur Cosmodrome** *Description*: One of the world\u2019s most important space centres, and currently the only one sending people into space (with the exception of China\u2019s manned launches; this is bound to change soon as the US resumes manned launches as well). Used by Roscosmos for manned and unammed missions, including currently all launches to the ISS. Lots of historical missions were launched from here, including the launch of Sputnik and Gagarin\u2019s first trip to space. There\u2019s lots of cool infrastructure, space history and museums to be seen; you can get closer to most of these than in other places, and it is not swarming with visitors. *Can you see a rocket launch?* Yes, Proton and Soyuz rockets are launched from here and you can see a live launch from a lot closer than in other places. For this, contact the company above and arrange your visit during a launch, they will know the details. Of course, launches can be delayed, so keep your expectations in check *How to visit*: The cosmodrome is a restricted area, so I booked a 6-day tour with a Russian company called [Country of Tourism](http://www.bestrussiantour.com/space/tour_baikonur), which did a fantastic job. They took care of all the permits and arrangements fort the cosmodrome and at Baikonur. You will need a visa for Russia, but not for Kazakhstan if you fly directly from Moscow. *What will you see?* This was definitely my coolest space center visit. The highlight was watching a live rocket launch of a manned Soyuz rocket to the ISS from less than a kilometer away (Soyuz TMA-09M). It was an amazing experience. Related to that, I also got to see the rocket rollout to the launch pad from a few short metres away; view the rocket on the launch pad before launch; attended the crew press conference and pre-flight report. There\u2019s lots of history and lots of other cool stuff at and around the cosmodrome. I visited the Energia-Buran launch pad, N1 transport vehicles, the History of Baikonur and the Baikonur cosmodrome museums, Yuri Gagarin\u2019s house, the International Space School and a Buran vehicle, among others. *More pictures [here](http://worldtravels.ro/?projects=kazakhstan) and a writeup [here](http://worldtravels.ro/?p=3037)* **Guiana Space Centre** *Description*: space center used for launches by the European Space Agency, launches unmanned missions on Vega, Ariane and Soyuz rockets (the latter bought from Russia). Very cool setting in the middle of the jungle. How to visit: The space center is a restricted area, so a tour needs to be booked in advance (you might be able to book on site, but I would definitely not risk it). Tours are free and contact info for booking is available [here](http://www.arianespace.com/spaceport-facility/practical-information/). They might be slow to answer, so don\u2019t give up and do call if you don\u2019t get a reply by email. French Guiana is pretty remote, so it will be slightly more complicated to make travel arrangements (these will include a mandatory yellor fever vaccine before travel \u2013 do your research). *Can you see a rocket launch?* Yes, if you time your visit right. Check out launch schedules on one of the many resources available online (i.e. Spaceflight Now). Of course launches may be delayed, so manage your expectations accordingly. Watching the rocket launch needs a separate booking which must be made in advance (no exceptions). Booking contacts are available [here](http://www.arianespace.com/spaceport-facility/practical-information/). They might be slow to answer, so don\u2019t give up and do call if you don\u2019t get a reply by email; use any of the phone numbers listed on the page if necessary, until you reach the right persons for booking. You will need to fill out a form and provide a number of details for the booking. *What will you see?* This was also one of my best experiences visiting a space center. I watched a live rocket launch \u2013 Ariane mission VA240 delivering four Galileo positioning satellites to orbit; very cool experience watching the launch from an observation point in the middle of the jungle (the launch was a few kilometres away). The space center tour was also very interesting, and included launch pads for Vega, Soyuz and Ariane, the control center for Ariane and Vega and the main Jupiter control center. The mix of hi-tech space infrastructure with rainforest flora and fauna was very interesting and gave the place a edge-of-the-world scifi feel. There\u2019s also the Musee de l\u2019Espace, which features a full-scale Ariane 5 model, but the exhibits and information are unfortunately dated and don\u2019t include ESA\u2019s more recent accomplishments. *More pictures [here](http://worldtravels.ro/?projects=french-guiana-france-new)* **Kennedy Space Center** *Description*: primary launch center for NASA. Major historical missions were launched from here, including the Apollo and Space Shuttle missions. KSC is one of the most well known space centers in the world and inclused an extensive visitor center. *How to visit*: Very easy to visit, as the visitor center is open to the public. Tours of the actual space center require booking, details [here](https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/info/tickets). *Can you see a rocket launch?* Yes, if you time your visit right. Check out launch schedules on one of the many resources available online (i.e. Spaceflight Now). Of course launches may be delayed, so manage your expectations accordingly. Details for viewing a launch available [here](https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/info/tickets). Viewing spots are limited and KSC gets very crowded during launches. *What will you see?* There\u2019s lots of cool history at KSC. You can see launch pads 39A and 39B used for the Apollo missions and the Space Shuttle, the famous Vehicle Assembly Building and the Space Shuttle landing strip; you will not get very close to those, though, and the bus tour is pretty short. You can also see a full-size almost-flown real Saturn V Rocket, the actual Atlantis Space Shuttle, an Apollo command center and lots of space exhibits. The visitor center is very well organized, but very crowded compared to all of my other space center visits. I also watched a live rocket launch \u2013 the Orion EFT-1 mission, a test of the Orion Multi-purpose Crew Vehicle; rocket used was the awesome Delta IV Heavy \u2013 the most powerful rocket currently in operation. *Some pictures in my US travel album, [here](http://worldtravels.ro/?projects=united-states-of-america)* **Tsukuba Space Center** *Description*: Headquarters of the Japanese Space Agency, JAXA, and primary location for Japan\u2019s space operations. *How to visit*: Easy to visit in if you're in Japan, via a short 70km train ride from Tokyo (and bus or taxi ride from Tsukuba train station). There\u2019s an exhibition hall (no reservations required, public access availalbe); guided tours are also available, but reservations are required. Details [here](http://global.jaxa.jp/about/centers/tksc/). *Can you see a rocket launch?* No. Japan\u2019s rocket launches take place from other sites. *What will you see?* The exhibit hall has lots of cool tech related to Japan\u2019s space program, including a full-size replica of Japan\u2019s Kibo module on the ISS and models of rockets and space missions. There\u2019s also a 50-metre rocket on display outside the exhibit halls. Guided tours were not offered when I visited, but currently it seems you can visit the Kibo control center and an astronaut training facility. *A few pictures in my Japan travel album, [here](http://worldtravels.ro/?projects=japan-new)* **European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC)** *Description*: main technology development and test centre for spacecraft and space technology of the European Space Agency *How to visit*: Easy to visit, via a short 50km train ride from Amsterdam; space exhibition is open to the public, but visiting the space centre is only possible during \u201copen days\u201d events. Details on the space expo [here](https://www.space-expo.nl/en); for info on open days events check [here](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESTEC). *Can you see a rocket launch?* No. No rocket launches happen from ESTEC. *What will you see?* The open day event was cool (but crowded). When I went in 2017 there were presentations and models of ESA\u2019s most important missions (including the world famous Rosetta mission which included the Philae lander that landed on a comet); a view of ESTEC operations including a centrifuge experiment and the assembly of the actual BepiColombo mission on route to Mercury, a model of the IXV space plane or a cool experiment that showed cosmic rays in action. If you can\u2019t make it to ESTEC\u2019s open day, you\u2019ll find the Space Expo nearby which is open year round and hosts more cool stuff, including a mockup of ESA\u2019s Columbus module on the ISS, models of missions and other assorted space gear. *A few pictures in my Netherlands travel album, [here](http://worldtravels.ro/?projects=netherlands)* **Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)** *Description*: NASA center operated by Caltech for development and operation of planetary space missions; also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions, and operates NASA\u2019s Deep Space Network. *How to visit*: Easy to visit, via a short 25km drive from Los Angeles. I visited a longer time ago when public tours were possible with advance booking. Visiting JPL nowdays is almost impossible, unfortunately. Details [here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/events/tours/views/). *Can you see a rocket launch?* No. No rocket launches happen from JPL. *What will you see?* My tour included visiting a command center for planetary missions, a clean room for development of space probes and an exhibition with models of famous space missions. **Space museums and other sites of interest for space exploration enthusiasts** * The National Air &amp; Space Museum in Washington is one of the mosts interesting space museums I have ever visited and included real and models of space capsules, gear and launch vehicles and a lot of very interesting space exhibits (such as the ALH84001 meteorite). * The Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow is another great space museum focusing on missions and accomplishments of the Russian space program, with models of many important historical missions, a model of a Mir space station and more. * Shanghai Science and Technology Museum in Shanghai. Displays a few exhibits and models related to China\u2019s space program, which are pretty interesting considering the country\u2019s space centers are not opened to the public (some limited access to the China\u2019s main space center is currently only available to Chinese nationals). The Shanghai Aerospace Enthusiasts Center includes some models of Chinese rockets. * Hong Kong Space Museum in Hong Kong displays some more exhibits on China\u2019s space program but was dated and in need of updating. The Hong Kong Science Museum had a much more interesting and modern special space exhibit when I visited, which included China\u2019s Lunar program, but it no longer seems to be available. * California Science Center, Los Angeles. Includes the real Space Shuttle Endeavour, including the shuttle\u2019s tank, the capsule used in the Apollo-Soyuz mission and a small number of other space exhibits. * SpaceX office in Hawthorne, California. Displays the first-ever recovered rocket stage outside the office building. The SpaceX office cannot be visited. * If you\u2019re in Arizona visiting the Grand Canyon, you can make an interesting stop at the Arizona Meteor Crater, which can be visited. * If you happen to be in Bucharest, Romania, you can see a Soyuz space capsule at the National Military Museum. The capsule carried Romania\u2019s only cosmonaut to space as part of a Russian space mission. Let me know if you have any questions. <wintersu7>: I have no idea on the history of how the place came to be, but the Cosmodrome in Hutchinson, KS is an awesome visit as well. They somehow managed to get the largest collection of Soviet space artifacts in the US (using the word artifact there isn\u2019t the word I would like, I just can\u2019t come up with a suitable word I like better) It\u2019s a good visit <Edit>: it\u2019s Cosmosphere, my apologies<moderatelyremarkable>: interesting space museum, I didn't know about this one. <wintersu7>: I was surprised by it as well. Basically the last place I would expect a serious and well rounded space museum. But there it is", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 3.25}

What are they supposed to do?<Throow123>: Manage the current orbital constellation, and likely administer the efforts aimed at new, decentralized platforms hardened against enemy space attack. In the long term, possibly play space traffic control. Mattis has also hinted at offensive capabilities, though.<Datengineerwill>: There's also some mid level talks of using the BFR as a transport and staging platform. A general litteraly mentioned that it carries twice the payload of a C-5 , cost less per flight per pound and can drop whatever you need any where in less than 45 mins. Probably 8 mins if that equipment is already staged in orbit.<Throow123>: Ah, so I\u2019m not buried in tinfoil. Thing is, Project Ithacus poked holes into the concept, holes that are inherent and that the BFR is subject to - vulnerability to enemy fire, difficulty in vehicle retrieval once it lands, significant issues with terrestrial landing in random locations rather than launchpads (issues more pronounced than on Mars, even). <Edit>: https://www.defensenews.com/space/2018/08/02/one-possible-job-for-spacexs-bfr-taking-the-air-forces-cargo-in-and-out-of-space/ &gt;Everhart has a reputation in the Air Force community for talking about big \u2014 and some critics would say ill-advised \u2014 technological leaps such as **autonomous or stealthy aerial refueling tankers**. My kind of guy.<Datengineerwill>: I would bet the BFR military transport version would get a laser scaled up from the ones going on C-7s and C-130s for missile defense. As for landing it would drop off it's bigger shipments at Theater Airbases. But it's not inconceivable that a few standard size drop pallets (read pods) could be easily developed to drop smaller loads nearly anywhere.<Throow123>: Those C-7/C-130 ones can\u2019t really burn through [something that\u2019s already heated up hotter than an acetylene torch.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rk9mvLFNqMQ)<Datengineerwill>: You're correct. They are designed to take out MANPADS and SAM missiles. A BFR would be facing a ASAT which would require a bit more power thus the scaled up statement. But also won't have to fight atmospheric attenuation as much.<Throow123>: Lower dwell time, though. Not to mention the smaller SAMs have inrared seekers, so you\u2019re mot actually out to destroy the missile, merely blind it.<Datengineerwill>: Actually assuming the BFR is at 1200 miles altitude the ASAT missile would spend 4 mins &amp; 32 seconds above atmosphere @ 15,000 mph. Also ASATs do use an IR seeker. The notional BFR laser would have nearly twice the dwell time, when compared to a C-130 vs a MANPAD, at minimum and still only have to soft-kill the missile via the seeker. all according to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASM-135\\_ASAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASM-135_ASAT)<Throow123>: The old air-launched ASAT missile is pretty low on the totem pole, I\u2019m thinking closer to the Nudol, which has to handle hypersonic ascent through the troposphere and likely relies on radar guidance. This means higher peak velocity; the 1200 mile MEO is a weird choice for the BFR itself, but OK. Your unrevealed calculations for effective laser range are dubious, as current militarily-useful lasers are heavily limited by optics and diffraction, not just atmosphere. Thus I feel no obligation to not argue that the Vual cosmosol canisters launched by the attacking vehicle would absorb and scatter laser fire - or that the attacking vehicle will likely be satisfied with coming within about 30 miles and setting off an X-ray-enhanced megaton-class nuke.<Datengineerwill>: I chose 1200 miles because its usually above the engagement envelope of most ASAT systems and is an easily attainable orbit for the BFR. My calculations are simply (altitude of intercept-height of atmosphere)/Velocity of interceptor. This gives me the minimum laser dwell time as i'm assuming the lasing cannot begin until the missile has entered whats defined as space and that the missile is already traveling at its max velocity at this point. &amp;#x200B; This previously selected orbit is already well above the Max engagement altitude of the Nudol (560 miles). Also its predecessor only carries a 10kt nuke. Assuming the Nudol retains a nuclear ABM capability (despite removing it from the A-135) the payload is likely not going to be more than 100kt as the warhead would be far to much mass for an interceptor. &amp;#x200B; Even if we assume the Nudol can reach an altitude of 1200 miles (more than double its stated max altitude), carries a 100kt nuke (10x larger than its predecessor and a highly unlikely capability), gets past BFR laser defenses and then strikes within 30 miles. Nukes do very little damage in space since there is no medium to carry its destructive shockwave or the massive amount of heat. You're left with the radiating effect in the IR thru X-ray spectrum which dissipates very quickly from blast center. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;<Throow123>: &gt; Nukes do very little damage in space since there is no medium to carry its destructive shockwave or the massive amount of heat. If you're dealing with an ordinary nuke. Antimissiles use tailored-effect neutron or x-ray munitions. The Spartan's megaton-range warhead with a gold tamper had an effectve kill range of 35 miles against hardened warheads.<Datengineerwill>: And lifting a megaton nuke to 1200 miles at intercept velocities would require a big ass fuck all kind if missile. Which needless to say would be prohibitively expensive. The Spartan only had that megaton warhead because it performed the intercept in the last 10 seconds or so before impact. Even the best ABMs of today lift at most a 10kt warhead to 700 miles.<Throow123>: &gt; The Spartan only had that megaton warhead because it performed the intercept in the last 10 seconds or so before impact. No wholly relevant. The Spartan was still used for exoatmospheric intercept - so it would still reach about 600 km high, and that's with optimization for the aforementioned brief intercept time.", "num_messages": 15, "avg_score": 2.2}
