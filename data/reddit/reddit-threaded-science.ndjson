In many parts of the rainforest, that economic benefit far outweighs the short-term gain of tearing it down. \u201cThe forest should unambiguously be saved when measured in a purely economic sense\u201d. <BoinkBoinkEtAliae>: The cattle ranchers and soybeans farmers don't care, they want that short-term money in the now. And the new President-elect of Brazil doesn't give a hootin hollar either.<Readeandrew>: Yes, this is the problem. The value of the rainforest does not accrue to the bank accounts of the people who want to cut it down unless it's cut down. <not_creative1>: Easy for us to say from here. These comments really show how disconnected people here are from the real world. Ideally, nobody should be cutting amazon down because it is important to the world\u2019s weather system. But tell that to a starving farmer living near its edge making $2 a day. Tell him he cannot cut trees and sell timber because world\u2019s temperature will rise by 2C in next 30 years. He is more worried about his next meal. California cut 98% of it\u2019s redwoods and made that sweet $$$, economic progress and railways. Why can\u2019t people in Brazil do that? It hurts the world? Then pay up. Pay them for not using their resources. Make sure those farmers aren\u2019t living in near starvation and need not cut down trees for their next meal<NotUniqueOrSpecial>: &gt; Pay them for not using their resources. You're actually dead-on, I think. The international community, recognizing the value of maintaining the Amazon, should band together to pay said farmers to do anything other than deforest their surroundings, even if that means paying them to do nothing at all. It would be like the US agricultural subsidies that [pay people to not farm](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/why-does-the-govt-pay-farmers), but it would actually benefit the whole world.<Kondor0>: Norway already did that, it worked for a time but apparently not anymore.<Habeus0>: Source?<Kondor0>: A simple google: <https>://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/22/norway-issues-1bn-threat-brazil-rising-amazon-destruction <http>://www.amazonfund.gov.br/en/home/<NotUniqueOrSpecial>: Well sure. Norway contributed $1 billion over a number of years. [From the Amazon Fund's website](http://www.amazonfund.gov.br/en/home/) it looks like they've got about $700 million in funds with $400 million disbursed, so far, this year. That's a $7 billion dollar difference. That's a shit-ton of money left on the table. The world's gotta step up, as a simple matter of self-preservation. <RelativeCrab>: Problem is that Brazilians don't care. They take the money and still cut the trees down.<NotUniqueOrSpecial>: If you pay more than they get for cutting down the trees, but don't pay them if they *do* cut down the trees, then no, they won't; it's just like how US farmers don't grow crops and also try to collect the \"don't grow crops\" money. It's simple: \"I'll pay you $300 if you don't do X, which will pay $200.\" Are you saying they're just going to throw the $100 away in spite? Are they so stupid that they don't know that's a bad idea? Humans are greedy. Rely on that simple fact and you can always predict the outcome.<ThePu55yDestr0yr>: Humans are also stupid, rely on the fact and you can also predict the outcome.<NotUniqueOrSpecial>: Very true, but greed and stupidity run hand-in-hand. In my experience, greed is the thing that motivates the very stupid to do otherwise irrational things. Make sure the greedy choice lines up with a global good, and even the stupid will do the right thing, whether they know they are or not.<ThePu55yDestr0yr>: &gt; Make sure the greedy choice lines up with a global good, and even the stupid will do the right thing, whether they know they are or not. That seems like a very (edit:) liberal opinion, no offense. The greedy have little reason not to make the most selfish choices, which will not line up with the global good. Even if you paid corporations not to cut down forests, what\u2019s stopping them from increasing ransom until nobody wants to pay, then cutting down the forest anyways? This is an inherently unsustainable model for keeping the Amazon intact.<NotUniqueOrSpecial>: Libertarian? Not at all. I'm a die-hard bleeding-heart liberal. In what world is asking the whole world to pony up billions of dollars to pay people not to work a libertarian solution? &gt; The greedy have little reason not to make the most selfish choices, which will not line up with the global good. That's my point. Line the selfish/greedy choice up with global good, and it won't matter what their ethics are. If they get paid $300 to do nothing, instead of $200 to do a lot of hard work, what do you think they'll choose? &gt; Even if you paid corporations not to cut down forests, what\u2019s stopping them from increasing random until nobody wants to pay then cutting down the forest anyways? Sorry, I'm not actually sure what you're trying to ask here. Are you asking what's to stop the corporations from cutting down the forests anyway? If so, it's the same thing (in reverse) that happens when environmentalists try to stop them from cutting them down right now: the actual people doing the deforestation won't, and they'll stop anybody who tries to. Currently environmentalists are murdered on a pretty regular basis for trying to prevent the deforestation in the Amazon. That happens because they're working against the locals who are just trying to feed their families. When the locals are more incentivized to keep the trees up than they are to chop them down, who do you think ends up on the sharp end of the machete? I'd argue it's not the environmentalists.<ThePu55yDestr0yr>: &gt; Libertarian? Not at all. I'm a die-hard bleeding-heart liberal. Yeah, what I meant was it was wishful liberal thinking. Blame autocorrect. &gt; Line the selfish/greedy choice up with global good, and it won't matter what their ethics are. If they get paid $300 to do nothing, instead of $200 to do a lot of hard work, what do you think they'll choose? That\u2019s not how greedy people work, if you can pay me $300 then what\u2019s stopping me for asking for more money like until you cannot pay? Also depends on frequency and amount of payments, $200-$300 is pocket change for a large corporation. That\u2019s assuming you can manage to get politicians to agree to pay Brazilians in the first place, which is massive hurdle considering corporations can pay politicians if they want to as well. Not to mention many people can be dumb as rocks on issues. All in all, it\u2019s an impractical unsustainable solution not only political standpoint, but economically as well. &gt; When the locals are more incentivized to keep the trees up than they are to chop them down, who do you think ends up on the sharp end of the machete? If locals can be incentivized to kill environmentalists to make money chopping down trees, what\u2019s stopping locals from accepting money from corporations to keep doing the same thing? From a greedy or stupid perspective, I\u2019d try to cheat the system to maximize my profits just saying. Corporations would also offer job security, and will pay more than a flat payment especially if they can gain a higher profit from cutting down the forest, than the money they gain from not doing so. Even if you could convince all the poor, corporations can just increase their payroll. &gt; I'd argue it's not the environmentalists. Boy you\u2019re in for a surprise...<Criculann>: &gt; That\u2019s not how greedy people work, if you can pay me $300 then what\u2019s stopping me for asking for more money like until you cannot pay? That the fact that you won't get paid anymore, perhaps? <ThePu55yDestr0yr>: OK let\u2019s rephrase, what\u2019s stopping me from bargaining for more money until you\u2019re *unwilling* to pay? Remember, you\u2019re dealing with groups of greedy and/or stupid people who will probably prioritize potentially growing short term profits than consider long term gains. If I can bargain to get paid $1,000 in one day rather than $100 in small increments over 10 days, I\u2019d pick the former, since I could be making more money and wasting less time, 2 birds with 1 stone. Assuming people are willing to pay merely $1,000 total, since this is about a potential necessity then realistically I can bargain for a much higher price on the onset. Although even if I picked the latter, if I was knowledgeable on how much people are willing to pay then I bargain to dramatically increase the increment soon after to the point where I might as well be paid $1000 on day 2. In a nutshell, good negotiators will bargain a ridiculously high amount and more so over time given the necessity of the Amazon, until people predictably complain about giving too much money to foreigners, then corporations will cut down the Amazon anyways. Not to mention, corporations will more often than not be able to pay more money than a static flat rate you\u2019re using to pay off greedy farmers. <Criculann>: &gt; OK let\u2019s rephrase, what\u2019s stopping me from bargaining for more money until you\u2019re unwilling to pay? You just said the same thing as before. What's stopping you from asking for more and more is that at some point I might just say \"Well, that's too much. I won't give you anything then.\" Which means you are out of luck because instead of receiving 300$ each month for doing nothing you now have to work for a mere 200$ each month. &gt; If I can bargain to get paid $1,000 in one day rather than $100 in small increments over 10 days, I\u2019d pick the former, since I could be making more money and wasting less time, 2 birds with 1 stone. I'm not quite sure why you think you could bargain for that? What stops a government from just saying no if the demands become too unreasonable? Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems to me that you're under the impression that all the bargaining power is with the people cutting down the rain forests. This is simply not true as they stand to lose as well if no deal is struck. &gt; Not to mention, corporations will more often than not be able to pay more money than a static flat rate you\u2019re using to pay off greedy farmers. Yes, this could be a problem. You could however try to make it unprofitable for those companies as they would have to pay the farmers more than you pay them.<ThePu55yDestr0yr>: &gt; I'm not quite sure why you think you could bargain for that? What stops a government from just saying no if the demands become too unreasonable? Exactly my point, the ones arguing for a deal aren\u2019t the farmers, it\u2019s everyone else, because they\u2019re the ones with a value to keeping the Amazon intact, hence this gives a strong leverage for either the farmers or corporations bargaining for a ransom. It\u2019s win-win for the corporations and farmers, since if you cheapen out, then the corporations will still profit and still pay out to the greedy farmers. If no deal, then the forest is still burned. If yes, then the forest won\u2019t be burned for a short time, but still gets burned when the deal is renegaded. (Keep in mind, the people bargaining aren\u2019t known for thinking in the long term benefits) &gt; Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems to me that you're under the impression that all the bargaining power is with the people cutting down the rain forests. This is simply not true as they stand to lose as well if no deal is struck. Because the bargaining power actually is in their favor, neither the farmers nor corporations lose much compared to the potential profit they can generate. The deal is being initiated on behalf of everyone else, not the farmers nor corporations. Not to mention, if the farmers feel like you\u2019re cheapening out on the deal then they\u2019re going to know you cannot be guaranteed to pay them as well as their employers. Not only can they bargain for a high price to begin with, but assuming a deal is struck, then they can also still simply continue to bargain for higher amounts over time, which eventually people will find either unreasonable or unfeasible, that\u2019s how ransoms work. At this point, the Amazon officially gets cut down, assuming the farmers will even have integrity not to cheat the system in the first place. &gt; Yes, this could be a problem. You could however try to make it unprofitable for those companies as they would have to pay the farmers more than you pay them. It\u2019s not very realistic to expect you can pay every potential farmer more than an organization designed to generate a profit, especially since you\u2019re betting on the farmer\u2019s laziness not really their greed. Let\u2019s say you plan to pay all the farmers, a corporation still doesn\u2019t needs to convince every farmer to cut down a tree for a profit, just enough greedy ones to actually do so. Which means unless you can manage to pay all the potentially greedy farmers a ludicrous amount indefinitely, so no corporations can afford said amount at any point in time, then the Amazon is still going to get cut down. Ofc, the likely scenario is assuming the farmers will optimally pretend to not cut down the Amazon, but actually still doing so, through plausible deniability. If you renegade on the deal, you would simply piss off the half of the farmers who actually aren\u2019t cutting down the Amazon to do so. If you plan to pay me a $100 over the course of ten days to have no job, because the maximum amount you\u2019re willing to pay is $1000 over any course of time, then it would be in my favor to simply bargain for the maximum amount, especially if I can generate more profits on a new job sooner for more profit.<Criculann>: &gt; Because the bargaining power actually is in their favor, neither the farmers nor corporations lose much compared to the potential profit they can generate. The deal is being initiated on behalf of everyone else, not the farmers nor corporations. I'm not saying that they aren't in a good position, I'm saying that not all the power is with them. Especially as soon as a deal is struck they do stand to lose something, namely they money they get from the deal. Not to mention that it's kind of hard for an uneducated farmer to bargain with governments. In all likelihood it would be a take it or leave it kind of deal for them. A corporation could also be threatened with tariffs if they don't play nicely. To be honest, now that I'm thinking about it I feel the bigger problem would be governments actually wanting to do this. If the US and/or the EU started threatening sanctions if those involved don't come to the bargaining table I don't see even big corporations having much bargaining power. Getting to that point seems unlikely though to be honest. &gt; If you plan to pay me a $100 over the course of ten days to have no job, because the maximum amount you\u2019re willing to pay is $1000 over any course of time, then it would be in my favor to simply bargain for the maximum amount, especially if I can generate more profits on a new job sooner for more profit. Why would I agree to give you the 1000$ all at once?<ThePu55yDestr0yr>: &gt; Not to mention that it's kind of hard for an uneducated farmer to bargain with governments. It\u2019s not rocket science to bargain or haggle simply for more money dude, bargaining happens more often amongst poverty or less educated, for obvious examples in Russia or Pakistan. Also you seem to be under the impression, it\u2019s only the farmers who will be bargaining, which will be predictably false. If I were a corporation I\u2019d do 2 obvious things if the deal favors everyone else, I\u2019d advise the farmers to bargain higher for a higher ransom and manipulate them to think they\u2019re being cheated. If either the ludicrous deal fails to happen at all, then I still profit from the Amazon. If it succeeds, then I, the corporations, can still accelerate the speed the world is unwilling to pay by increasing the ransom to an even more lucrative amount, before the next paymen Also assuming, the farmers are actually acting in good faith instead of maximizing their profit by simply by lying and cutting the Amazon anyways. Which if you renegade on the increasingly lucrative deal, then the corporations still win, since you would simply piss off the good farmers to cut down the Amazon, while the greedy cheating ones are already convincing them to cutting it down as retribution. &gt; A corporation could also be threatened with tariffs if they don't play nicely. It would take miracles before any practical action can be expected from politicians around the globe on the corporations here. If they weren\u2019t enough tariffs when environmentalists got murdered, do you really expect effective political action from politicians around the globe to save trees? I\u2019m not even joking, this is how the conversation is going to go. &gt; To be honest, now that I'm thinking about it I feel the bigger problem would be governments actually wanting to do this. If the US and/or the EU started threatening sanctions if those involved don't come to the bargaining table I don't see even big corporations having much bargaining power. Getting to that point seems unlikely though to be honest. Honestly that blows my mind, since I thought it was an obvious point, bureaucracy for anything is slow as shit. Not to mention, how easy it is for corporations to bribe politicians to either stall or make official actions toothless. &gt; Why would I agree to give you the 1000$ all at once? Because you have no choice if the corporations are smart enough to bargain at all, and they will still influence the farmers with 99% certainty imo. It also makes little difference, since they could bargain for a price, which will sooner reach the maximum of total tolerance the people are willing to pay, before every next payment. This is the corporations best gamble to expedite their profits by cutting down the Amazon faster by waiting less longer, while manipulating farmers who want to maximize their short term profits from their short sighted appeal. Imo, the deal does nothing on a practical long term level to solve the issue around protecting the Amazon, it\u2019s in a nutshell a very temporary band-aid until the globe doesn\u2019t want to pay for an increasingly lucrative ransom. At a good faith maximum estimate, I estimate the deal still impractically prevents it\u2019s destruction for about 1-20 years assuming it happens in the first place, assuming most the farmers are good faith actors, and not greedy. 1-5 assuming the worst place scenario where corporations can still convince greedy farmers to optimally lie, while on an official level making higher and higher ransoms till the deal is officially called off. Honestly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to convince you of my perspective, so I think it\u2019s best to simply agree to disagree like mature people.", "num_messages": 22, "avg_score": 2635.5909090909}

Just saying.<PatapscoMike>: As a greenhouse owner, I can assure you that you're going to need pesticides. Some pests are way, way worse in a greenhouse.<NoPunkProphet>: They're talking about hydroponics, clean room style.<kn0ck>: Doesn't that have an even higher carbon footprint than simply using natural sunlight? <QuantumCakeIsALie>: I'd guess it depends on how the electricity is produced. Solar/Wind/Hydro could make it viable if it saves on transport. On the flip side, if your electricity comes from coal plants, it's untenable; even an electric car could be worst than a gas one.<real_bk3k>: If solar, you'll need even more land than the farm needed. Newer generations of nuclear are a far superior near zero carbon option.<QuantumCakeIsALie>: A big solar farm in uncultivable land would be neutral in this situation. Nuclear fusion would be the way to go: clean, safe, efficient. But we're still far from it. Currently I think Hydro is pretty much the best deal from a climate (and price) standpoint if you consider the whole lifetime of the plants, (e.g. end of life waste for batteries and solar panels/wind turbines).<real_bk3k>: Producing solar panels and a means to store the power is far from neutral. And solar efficiency is far from 100 percent thus it takes more land. Even if not cultivable there are probably better uses including leaving it natural. And when I say nuclear, I'm not talking 60s type water reactors. I would not call those inherently safe. The newer types available are better in every way. Look up what technologies are available now. If you get how they work, and the process of a nuclear meltdown is the result of steam explosions in the first place, you'll understand why it isn't a realistic concern for something like a molten lead or molten salt reactor not to mention others. It is an interesting subject to learn some about.<NoPunkProphet>: &gt;solar efficiency is far from 100 percent This is nonsense. No generator is 100% efficient. You're pushing an agenda and you've slipped up making a blatantly loaded assertion<real_bk3k>: Follow the damn conversation... talking about powering an indoor farm, with solar as one (bad) option. It world take more land to build the solar farm than to just let plants recieve natural sun BECAUSE SOLAR EFFICIENCY IS LESS THAN 100%. Sorry to ruin your conspiracy boner, but it doesn't require an agenda to point out converting light to electricity and then back to light is idiotic and wasteful. Where do people like you come from? If you really think anyone with a different perspective must have an agenda... Get yourself professionally evaluated.<NoPunkProphet>: &gt;Get yourself professionally evaluated. I see we've moved up to personal attacks, nice. &gt;let plants recieve natural sun 1. Photosynthesis is also not 100% efficient. 2. It makes perfect sense to collect sunlight from a large area and concentrate it into a smaller area. If I wanted to power a high power cutting laser with solar I could. Would it be inefficient? Of course. But how else are you going to cut steel with sunlight? GL bud<BetterFasterSmarter>: That doesn't make sense at all. You're introducing a middle man into the equation for no reason and making the process less efficient. Let me get this straight, you want to have solar panels, to power lights, to feed plants. You do realize this is a discussion about climate impact right and your solutions sounds terrible in every scenario unless you were growing illegal substances.<NoPunkProphet>: If you grow plants using sunlight you have to transport them. Much more difficult to automate. Using sunlight is only more efficient if you externalize the energy cost of transportation, irrigation, etc. You have to account for the entire path: from producer to distributor to retailer to the plate, because indoor farms can literally go directly from the producer to the plate. It also has a hard cap on efficiency, there's only so much more we can do to improve it, and most of the improvements like genetic engineering are a moot point since they apply to both applications. Energy production and distribution is far from optimized, and robotics is still in it's infancy. Once the plants can be grown anywhere there's less of a need to convert the energy into a calorie dense form like meat, which is hugely inefficient (6:1 conversion). If you're hungry you can just eat more plants, and since the production chain is distributed you don't have to load up on food, you can count on there being food available where you are, where you're headed and even in-between. More healthy eating patterns leads to lower health costs, which are another externalized cost in industrial agriculture. People on plant-based diets metabolize food more efficiently, and don't suffer the psychological effects of eating red meat (more externalized costs). Distributed production chains are also less vulnerable to interruptions in the process since weak links are reduced or irrelevant. Distributed logistics and energy-based food production scale with far-future tech. If vat growing nutrients takes off it'd be a simple matter to expand indoor farms with vat departments, since such an industry would require the same resources hydroponics need: water and energy. With infinitely abundant energy people will take a serious look at localized water production, as the energy cost of condensers and dehumidifiers are negated. If humans ever develop a way to make external sources of energy like electricity or heat bio-avaliable directly food production would plummet. Abandoning our biology altogether would also negate the need for food. Plants are just energy and water. Why ship them in a truck when you can send them electronically? You wouldn't download a cow. \ud83d\udc04<BetterFasterSmarter>: You bring up a lot of fluff that's unrelated to the original question. In your scenario, we have to develop irrigation systems to coincide with our sewage. Develop cheap energy/water production when we face water shortages in the future what with climate change and all. You keep bringing up hypothetical s like condensers and dehumidifiers that amazing have insignificant energy costs and development that the vats would bring about. I'm sorry man/woman, this is not a thing and only has potential in space travel or nuclear fallout. <edit>: You have interesting thoughts but they're not grounded in reality or our present day technology <edit>: I feel like I need to repeat this. You are in a thread about farming impacts on climate, advocating for solar panels to feed plants. If you had said rooftop farming, you might have a leg to stand on. <NoPunkProphet>: &gt;You bring up a lot of fluff that's unrelated to the original question. Sorry, I'm just discussing things generally. Allow me to consolidate my position. First understand that when I say \"cost\" or \"waste\" what I mean is a loss of resources, not money. I don't care about money. What's important to me is optimizing the process, you can read about this sort of thing [here](https://www.allaboutlean.com/muda/). The goal for each process is the same, to convert a given energy source into bio-available energy for people. To accomplish this, the energy source must be turned into food regardless of intermediaries, obtained by said people and digested. The costs of industrialized agriculture that would be negated or diminished by distributed hydroponic farms are as follows: * Cannot be automated to the same degree (Wasted potential and labor) * Must be imported to population centers (transportation cost) * More transportation intermediaries (logistics cost) * Requires irrigation lost to evaporation (motion cost, material loss) * Conversion loss to meat (over processing) * Conversion loss in digestion due to dependence on meat (material loss) * Psychological effects of consuming meat (Product defects) * Scalability (future cost, potential cost) If you're only looking at the electrical energy loss of hydroponics compared to traditional agriculture, of course hydro is worse. Way worse. But as soon as that energy gets stored in chemical form hydro starts winning because for hydro plants it's a very short trip. Many of the costs of traditional agriculture I listed above aren't considered because they're artificially deflated, subsidized or externalized. That doesn't make them go away though, it just puts money in the pockets of the people who own these systems. I apologize for my rant earlier, and I hope this clears it up a bit.<BetterFasterSmarter>: I'll play along cause it's good conversation but you gotta realize it's the internet. No one wants to here your views. Stick to the topic. It's hard to have a discussion when you go on tangents like what you're doing with meat here. Yes we all know meat is bad for the environment, that's not the question here is it. Lets address the points you listed though. - As for automation, you don't think they use sprinkler systems? Indoor systems require more labor and more workers. Granted if you're talking about a scale on the individual level, sure, but not really ideal. - I agree with your transportation costs and whatnot. I agree that small nations developing this like Singapore would stand to benefit. - There's no way vertical farming approaches the scalability of traditional farming. We've addressed workers but we can't even get vertical farming to be commercially viable, nevermind scaling it up. - Look I'll concede that there are more uses for vertical farming but unless you're a small nation that happens to be near a lot of cheap energy/windfarms, you would never be interested in doing this. Maybe colder climates as well. It's just not the answer to all like you're claiming it is.<NoPunkProphet>: &gt;we all know meat is bad for the environment I didn't actually say anything about the environment, I was talking about the material and social costs of meat. &gt;As for automation, you don't think they use sprinkler systems? Labor is not an expense of irrigation, movement, energy and materials is. Even a common and cheap commodity like water has a cost. &gt;Indoor systems require more labor and more workers The labor cost of hydro will decrease much more rapidly than that of traditional agriculture with the development of technology. Traditional agriculture has been done to death, so to speak. &gt;we can't even get vertical farming to be commercially viable I'm not concerned with it's financial prospects, hydro is objectively more efficient.

I've worked at power plants, refineries, wind farms, and other industrial sites. There's no way in hell that I'd allow one of my workers to work the hours a doctor does. It's illegal and would be an outrageous and unacceptable hazard, and in any case, no manager would assign something like that. Would you trust a welder to weld on an airplane frame or some other life-critical structure in their 23rd straight hour of work? What doctors are expected to do in the normal course of their occupation is utterly insane and would just not be allowed in any other industry. It blows my mind. <myceli-yum>: My broken record script is: \"I cannot safely do my job until I get some sleep. I cannot safely do my job until I get some sleep.\" Even if I'm on call for 72 hours straight it doesn't mean I can literally work for 72 hours straight. I'll like, die. <Weserat>: Question from someone who's not in the industry and doesn't have any friends who are: Why are you on call for 72 hours? Why not assign 8 hour shifts weeks in advance like literally every other industry? What service are you providing that another well rested doctor cannot 8 hours later?<grambell789>: I have heard that it allows doctors see a changing set of symptoms play out. Not sure if its a a reason or an excuse.<BananaInTheZIFSocket>: Pre-med here. The greatest amount of fatal errors in care happen at shift changes. A doctor will remember administering warfaren to a patient (in reality the nurse would administer it, but bear with me). He may forget to put that in his report, or his replacement physician at end of shift won\u2019t read the report, etc. and someone may readminister it, causing bleeding through the skin and killing the patient. So an incredibly long shift is a way to safeguard against dumb shit like that. However, as mentioned by the OP these long hours eventually burn out physicians, eventually increasing malpractice related fatalities over time anyways. It\u2019s a broken system (just like all of healthcare). Edited for clarity and weird English cause I\u2019m tired. Also, thank your PCP next time you see them; their lives are hard.<throwawayplsremember>: sounds like the solution is to improve shift change communications instead of overworking doctors. <BananaInTheZIFSocket>: I think there are a lot of solutions that we should try, that seem relatively simple. But alas, beauracracys never seem to make sense. We also need more doctors in general. There are roughly 330 million Americans. According to Statista.com (not certain of the validity of the site but it sounds correct) there are about 1.1 million practicing doctors. That means that if each and every one was simply a PCP, they would have roughly 300 unique patients to be concerned with a year. Factor into that some are specialists, some are in research, some are in teaching at medical schools, the number of patients that a doctor must be responsible for begins to climb and is likely closer to 1,000. We need more, hands down. But yeah, sorry for the tangent.<elspazzz>: But we won't get them because the cost to become a DR is so insane because the education costs, in general, are out of hand. Now add on top that it's getting to the point you can't afford to run your own practice anymore. I've known more than one Dr. who quit because they didn't want to go work for the local large healthcare system and simply couldn't afford to have the practice staff needed to deal with the insurance companies anymore. <RollerDude347>: I'm honestly disappointed I couldn't afford to become a doctor. I'm not even sure why I finished Highschool at this point. I'm well educated on my own initiative and Highschool was just prep for a system I can't afford.<strthugger>: If I might suggest why not become a scrub tech? You can usually be hired as an or aide ( helps prepare rooms for surgery and does cleaning afterwards) with little to no experience, and then you could go to school once you have some income coming in. You usually just need two years in a program for it, and some trade schools offer it at much cheaper rates than regular schooling. As a scrub tech you would be directly in the room during surgeries helping the doctor by passing instruments, occasionally holding things in place and helping to position the patient. You get to be in the OR and help without the amount of pressure and stress doctors deal with. If you have any questions feel free to ask! <Hellcat1970>: Becoming a doctor is far too expensive, and requires insane dedication to academia just to apply for medical school. I definitely think that a doctor should be well rounded and be able to do these things at a high level, but the barrier of entry is too high. <projectew>: We've got plenty of med students though. The economic barrier to entry, while being significantly higher than many others, is merely a symptom of the broken higher education system like any other. I think the dedication barrier to entry is fine where it is, by virtue of the overabundance of med students. It should be as high as possible while still resulting in enough graduating med students, in order to maximize the quality of our doctors.<throwawayplsremember>: Exactly. Some might argue that there's a lot of very academia things that a practicing doctor doesn't really need to do in school, but it's about the discipline and consistency of work. The content might not be useful but the schools are doing a good job in training doctors to be very meticulous. The cost is not just the school's fault, it's also the banks and the fed's fault for making so much money available in loans. There might be some corrupt schools out there, but most schools reinvest their profits back into the school, which is why so many American universities are the best in the world. <projectew>: Sure, but I, and I think a majority of others, would be totally fine if our universities \"sunk\" to the abysmal level of other Western nations if it meant they could afford to attend them. There are ways to afford the advancement of academia without grifting the students themselves.<Hellcat1970>: Maybe its my view of doctors, but Doctors shouldnt have to be these genius machine like people. Doing well in academia is hard and needs a consistency of work, it also requires lots of time. This is true for most degrees, but in order to even get into a lower tier med school essentially requires a 3.8 average taking rigorous chemsitry courses and doing well on the mcat (which is also based ona graded scale against other student). A test where most people take a year off school or a semester with a single course to study for it. I am sure there are people who do this without an issue, but doing all of this while shadowing, and merely living is to me unjustifiable. There is a better system out there, and I would like to point out that EMT/paramedics save lives, but dont have anywhere near the level of extensive education or upfront barriers. I think really highly of doctors, but I think we could pursue different ways to fill this role, which is why we see a lot of P.A/D.O<throwawayplsremember>: Doctors are not always geniuses, a lot of them are actually just very passionate and consistent people that worked very very hard to be what they are. Being a good physician doesn't require some genius mental work, it requires a fuck ton of knowledge that is learned through hard work, and a lot of experience with patients. You definitely have to be very smart though, but genius is not a requirement. <Hellcat1970>: I think doctors are very smart, but all these barriers, money, cost, time, I dont even think hard work will do it. You need luck, and a lot of time. Time that is a luxury if you have a kid, or need to provide for just yourself.", "num_messages": 18, "avg_score": 2186.3333333333}

It is possible that self-provided misinformation, or lying, has similar effects. We hypothesized that lying impairs memory for younger adults, as increased cognitive control, necessary to inhibit a truthful response, comes at the expense of retaining veridical information in memory. Because older adults show deficits in cognitive control, we hypothesized their memory is unaffected by lying. In the present study, participants made truthful and deceptive responses on a computer while EEG data were recorded. We investigated medial frontal negativity (MFN), an ERP component associated with deception and cognitive control, which may be differentially generated across age groups due to differences in cognitive control. Unexpectedly, results revealed that older adults showed reduced accurate memory for items to which they previously lied compared to younger adults. There were no age differences in correct memory for truth items. We did not find the expected MFN effect, however results revealed long-lasting negative slow waves (NSW) to lie items across age in the pre-response period and following the response cue, suggesting the role of working memory processes in deception. These findings demonstrate that lying is another source of misinformation and influences memory differently across the lifespan.<John_Hasler>: &gt; Because older adults show deficits in cognitive control... *On average*. This will be interpreted as proof that everyone over [speaker's age + 20] lies constantly and believes all their own lies. <SatinwithLatin>: Yes. This really should not become a stick against old people, but could provide explanation for why certain seniors *with an established pattern* of believing in BS do what they do. <John_Hasler>: Yes. However, consider that: 1) Almost everyone suffers from this effect to some degree. 2) Given that, think how much more likely people (young or old) are to come to firmly believe assertions they made which they did not know to be false at the time they made them. <SatinwithLatin>: 1) Agreed. 2) The study referenced lies, not assertions not known to be false. <Muroid>: I think the point was that if asserting a lie can lead someone to come to believe that that lienis true, then asserting something which the person does not believe to be a lie at the time of the assertion may have a similar reinforcement effect on their likelihood to believe that assertion to be true.<Xenobane>: Satinwithlatin's point was, while your hypothesis about unknowing false assertions may be true (and seems logical to me), this scientific study provides evidence only for known falsehoods, not unknowing false assertions.

Single payer. Get a single payer system and this will end - please don\u2019t confuse that for socialized healthcare. Just get rid of the middle men and scummy greedy insurance. <Renovatio_>: I think you have a wrong perception Universal healthcare =/= single payer. There are MANY countries that effectively use a multiplayer system (with private insurance companeis to boot). Germany is probably the biggest and really successful how they implemented it. Multipayer can work very well. Single Payer can work well too. It depends on the structure that is set up. But universally I see that heavy price control is a key factor in these universal systems. <VValrus54>: I disagree. Sorry. Since we are discussing US healthcare. The fix is single payer. Period. <Renovatio_>: I mean breaking up monopolies/ogliopolies isn't exactly foreign to the US. Telecoms were broken up (and probably should be again). It wouldn't be impossible to roll out some price controls and heavy rules that insurance companies would have to follow. Except that insurance companies pretty my own all the people who would be voiting for it. What do you think would happen in a single payer model? Does medicare buy all the hospitals, employee all the nurses and physicians? <VValrus54>: I am not suggesting Medicare as I feel that has efficiency issues as well since they tend to be rigid and short pay leaving the bill to us. More of an amazon. Single payer in terms of not billing separately and having realist pricing models for patient care and stay. <Renovatio_>: Amazon? I mean cool for being innovative but I'm not really following. \"Amazon of healthcare\" just doesn't mean anything to me. But honestly we should just literally copy-paste a working system. If we are going to do single payer then Canada or UK is probably the easiest. <VValrus54>: A one stop shop. One billing office. One customer service. One revenue cycle. One payer. One place. <Renovatio_>: So the government pays, a single private entity who then pays individual doctors, hospitals, and other services? <VValrus54>: Government systems are inefficient. I do not think or feel that a government ran / controlled system will work efficiently. You mentioned Canada before. Why do Canadians come to the US for their healthcare... <Renovatio_>: &gt;Why do Canadians come to the US for their healthcare... I mean you can answer that question in a few ways. Wait times is a big issue that Canada has acknowledge, is working on, but doubtful they will ever be as quick as a fee-for-service model. Another way to look at it is that there are a disproportional amount of people coming to the US for medical services--especially the wealthy and the elite. This is likely due to the large amount of cutting edge equipment--at a high cost but still is there. But from my assumptions from our conversation it sounds like you want the government to have as little influence as possible so that there is less bureaucracy and less waste. So essentially handing the reigns of healthcare over to a single private company. Now with the government acting as, essentially a giant checkbook, what is going to stop the other company from bloating and becoming inefficient and corrupt. I mean look at other state sponsored monopoly; PG&amp;E isn't this shining beacon of worker efficiency. FWIW I don't think Canada has the best system. I much like Germany and korea?(maybe its taiwan). <VValrus54>: I don\u2019t want the government involved at all. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the answer. I feel that a single private payer ought to do it. Should it be regulated? Sure. But then we would have to agree and discuss how to pay for that. <Renovatio_>: How are you not going to get the government involved? If there is a single payer system *everyone* has to participate. What happens when people don't participate? What happens when people refuse to pay? What happens when someone decides to start a competitor and won't accepts your single-payer company? This sounds like a have your cake and eat it too type scenario.<VValrus54>: ? Cake and eat it too? In what way? - If a person doesn\u2019t want to participate? Why do they get a choice? Why should they? Do you think that a non clinical person knows more than a physician when it comes to their health? That is a whole different debate and a lot of opinion vs fact vs law vs ethics and autonomy. I don\u2019t want to discuss those. Sorry. - If you want to reduce the healthcare cost in the US - you have to address the problem. The problem is not having a single payer. It\u2019s the overhead. I know it\u2019s difficult to understand where I am coming from but feel free to talk to your internist / pcp / primary and see what they say. <Renovatio_>: So let me put it this way. For ease of use we'll just keep referring to your single payer company as amazon. Single payer is enacted. However I don't want to get insurance from amazon. I don't want to give them my money since I really hate the company. So I am uninsured. I get in a car accident, I am unconscious and taken to the hospital. Does amazon just eat the costs? What happens when ~10% of the population decides not to pay because they are really not risk adverse (10% is about the amount we have uninsured today). I mean it seems like you're talking about some quasi-libertarian utopia here. I'm not sure if its me but the whole idea is coming off as very vague. Could you put it into concrete terms? Like here is my idea: I want to have a law stating everyone must have insurance, if you refuse to pay the premiums are deducted from your paycheck. The government offers insurance especially for lower income but anyone who wants to join. Private markets are allowed but prices are completely fixed to what the government would reimburse. (just off my head, trying to copy germany but honestly can't remember all the nuances) &gt;If you want to reduce the healthcare cost in the US - you have to address the problem. The problem is being addressed its just that our solutions are crap. &gt;The problem is not having a single payer. As I outlined before many countries successfully do multipayer. It is 100% errorneous to attribute the high cost of US healthcare to multipayer. &gt;It\u2019s the overhead I agree. I can't source it atm but there was something like a 3200% increase in healthcare administrators over a 10 year period. &gt;I know it\u2019s difficult to understand where I am coming from but feel free to talk to your internist / pcp / primary and see what they say. You don't have to patronize me. I work in healthcare, I'm acquainted with economics, I've had many a discussion with doctors, nurses, and believe it or not, administrators. And believe it or not they all don't have the same solution. One thing is a common belief though is that we are not in a tenable situation and something huge is going to happen soon whether we like it or not. <VValrus54>: I wasn\u2019t patronizing. Now I will be since you obviously didn\u2019t read my response. I didn\u2019t want to get into discussion of ethics or law or autonomy, so thanks for typing out your wants and opinion. Really. It\u2019s... neat. - I am glad you work in healthcare. I do too. I am glad you are acquainted with economics. I am too. You keep referring to Canada / European models. Get a grip. Do more reading. The healthcare providers there face the same if not similar frustrations the rest of my colleagues face - start with being underpaid and burnouts. You want a clear cut plan. I am not a planner. I simply stated what I feel and experience as the biggest problem that adds expense to the US healthcare system. It\u2019s the overhead. Where from? From not having a single payer. You may disagree but again all you have to do is look at Europe. Where all those taxes go into a health fund. Guess how well that is managed? Perhaps you can argue it\u2019s bette than the US but again it still worse than a single payer. <Renovatio_>: If you don't want to have a discussion why are you even replying?

Experts believe if we continue on, close to 90% of ocean species will be extinct by 2050. Chain reactions of species loss are happening currently and will only continue. None of the fish we catch for human use will exist in a few decades \\[[Source](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/oceans-fish-could-disappear-in-40-years-un-5541451.html)\\]. This loss of species will likely have dire implications for land species as well. Where fish farms cut down on these effects, they are *drastically* worse for the environment \\[[Source](http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/2008/08/the-pros-and-cons-of-fish-farming/)\\]. Almost half of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (roughly the size of the United States) by piece is fishing nets, some of which can weigh 5 tons. The fishing nets are 90% by weight. Discarded fishing nets kill hundreds of thousands of dolphins, turtles, and whales yearly \\[[Source](https://us.whales.org/wdc-in-action/end-bycatch-stop-deaths-in-fishing-gear-0)\\] \\[[Source](https://www.thedodo.com/in-the-wild/ocean-animals-dying-in-lost-fishing-gear)\\]. It's hard to find a balance when it comes to fishing our oceans with the demand of billions of humans. None of what we are currently doing is \"sustainable\" and it's hard to say if it can ever be so. Hundreds of thousands of independent (legal or illegal) fishermen and companies all working simultaneously in a territory that is objectively hard to regulate - the ocean. Our best bet is to *heavily* decrease (ideally, eliminate) our demand for fish and work to fund programs that foster rehabilitation and protection of marine life. Think twice the next time you're going out for sushi!<jlharper>: The solution is to increase demand for sustainable farmed sources of fish, and to grant the businesses that run sustainable farms massive tax incentives for expanding their range and the quality of their produce. Historic punitive responses to poaching in the world's oceans, with a global taskforce dedicated to investigating potential large scale poaching operations . A global committee for the conservation of maritime diversity backed by world leaders and leading scientists; granted the authority declare large swathes ocean which contain significant levels of ecological diversity as international heritage sites. Even steps towards any of these measures in individual nations could have a drastic positive impact on the world's oceans.<Dong_World_Order>: Or encourage people to stop eating meat altogether. Farming has its own set of problems.<CitricThoughts>: You'll have far more luck with meat imitation stuff that tastes like the real thing than with convincing people to only eat normal plants.<RedLotusVenom>: Imitation meats are plants, bruh.<CitricThoughts>: I think you miss my point. Yes they're plants but people are likely to eat good imitation meat over just giving up the taste and flavor of meat entirely. Trying to force people to give up meat will end poorly. Slowly changing people over to imitation meat is much more likely to work especially if it ends up cheaper than real meat.<RedLotusVenom>: And those are the same people that complain how expensive veganism is. There is insurmountably more vegan food variety than non-vegan. If they truly care and want to make an impact, people are going to have to suck up the price of imitation products, or they're going to have to rewire their palate and learn to cook and try new things. Plain and simple.<CitricThoughts>: It really doesn't matter what kind of case you make or what you offer in terms of veganism. If you try to force people to give up meat at any point and take it out of the grocery stores they will riot. People need a substitute that tastes the same so they don't have to change much. The impact will change, people will not. It's far better to just raise the price of real meat, drop the price of fake meat and have people change over on their own. Then some might consider a more broad based vegan diet. Forcing austerity never works. Making reasoned arguments rarely works, many everyday people just won't even listen. They will however listen to whatever their pocketbook tells them is the best thing to do. When fake meat that tastes like the real thing is cheaper than real meat then most people will swap on their own. <RedLotusVenom>: Man, there are plenty of vegans who love meat and have realized that their tastebuds are not worth the ecological destruction and ethical nightmarisms caused by farming and fishing. I think all humans are capable of this realization with the right representation of facts and logic. <CitricThoughts>: Good luck with that. <RedLotusVenom>: Thanks. We're having luck.

Between 60 and 80 percent of people surveyed have not been forthcoming with their doctors about information that could be relevant to their health, according to a new study <acepincter>: Personally, I feel like the relationship between me any my doctor is that of a customer to a service provider. I go to my doctor with a complaint, and he provides a medical service. I don't feel like I want a relationship where I should be expected to tell my doctor anything but what he needs to know related to the specific problem. For example, I went in for an STD screening and sexual health checkup last summer. Do you think I want to answer questions about my choices in sex partner to a man I see maybe 12 minutes a year, tops? \"Just take my blood, and piss, and tell me if it's clear, ok?\" I know what the risks are, and I made my choices. Is that abnormal to think this way? I certainly didn't agree to anything beyond that. Obviously, if I'm discussing my cholesterol levels, my diet is relevant. Sports are relevant to exercise-related injury or stress and in general. Drug use is relevant. But, I don't think I should be expected beyond that to provide info. The fact is, they have a oath-bound requirement to put my health as the first and foremost priority, when, as it pertains to my life, I tend to treat my health as something I am willing to spend like currency to gain some value in other areas when it comes to things like taking risks, using recreational drugs, travel, sex, and general lifestyle choices. So, mine and the Doctor's goals don't really match up 100% of the time.<RattleSnakers>: Its not uncommon, but you are not doing yourself any favors with this point of view. A doctor does not have much time on their hands- any question they ask you is pertinent to forming an accurate diagnosis. The body is interconnected. Just because you believe a question about your health is irrelevant to your visit, does not mean it is irrelevant. If the doctor asks it, the question likely affects your diagnosis, and telling the truth benefits your long term health, and informs the doctor\u2019s wholistic view of your health.<acepincter>: Well, that's fair! But honest response to questioning isn't quite the same as being \"forthcoming\" with information. It leaves it to the patient to decide. I'm not there so that the *doctor* can get a holistic view of my health- I'm there for a service! And if I wanted long-term health advice, I'd share more. Chances are, if I know it's relevant to my health in a particular area, I already know how my decisions impact me and what the doctor will suggest. Is he going to tell me anything I don't already know? It can put people in the somewhat uncomfortable position sometimes of being with a doctor and having to either say \"Yes, doc, I know it's bad for me, but It's my body, my life, and I intend to continue doing it against your advice\" or play sheepish with them.<RattleSnakers>: I believe that\u2019s the exact definition of forthcoming- ready or available when wanted or needed. In my mind, that mean providing complete answers, not withholding part or whole of the truth. Anyhow, we differ in our points of view on healthcare. There\u2019s a difference between service and care. Doctors are care providers, which is quite different than service providers. It means submitting to expertise (on the patient\u2019s part). Admittedly that\u2019s difficult to do without trust. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for physicians to view and relate to the entire person, not just service their parts like some auto body shop of the flesh. And usually doctors know that living 100% clean by medical standards isn\u2019t fun, and most follow a more moderate view on lifestyles. In my experience they\u2019ll have a conversation and explain why they ask more sensitive questions, explain their motivation, and only ask for what they need.", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 17.6}

Often two people both take facts as their basis, they just pick and choose the facts that suit their ideology. It isn't a truth vs falsity problem, it's a big picture vs small picture problem.<etheral333>: I think that its a big picture vs small picture that has a layer of goals on top of it. Even if people agree on small or big pictures if the goals aren't the same people can and will still run into issues. Those conflicting goals can also be a cause for excluding potential decisions. A rushed example would be around income inequality. Even if everyone has the same information if the desired goals and outcomes are not aligned it doesn't really matter. If some say the end goal is to reduce inequality but another side simply wants to allow for a more equitable outcome they can still end up disagreeing. That doesn't even take in to account all the sides drastically opposed to combating inequality. <twoWYES>: Nor does it take into account how inequality ought be combated. I'm that weird pro-markets guy who recognises massive inequality impedes effective market function, so this question causes me alot of headaches.<etheral333>: I think it impedes effective market function because we allow for dead weight. A quick easy way to fix the issue is to let dead weight go. In practical application this would mean letting people die in large numbers due to them not being worth the burden of keeping around.<twoWYES>: For the sake of argument let's say I agree with you. But then the question becomes what do you mean by 'letting', because I promise you hundreds of millions of hungry people are going to tear industry apart looking for their next meal, impeding effective market function. If it costs more to rebuild the machinations of the economy from scratch than just to put them in boxes with food and VR, isn't corporate socialism the economic approach?<etheral333>: Letting go in the case means essentially a mass culling. Waiting until automation can substitute most types of work and have been rolled out first would be optimal for the people that don't get culled but past that point. It helps that technologically we are at a place in time that if a war broke out between the top 3% vs the bottom 97% (and the 3% weren't stopped by things like morality) the top 3% could win within a few weeks at most. (One of my base assumptions is that life, including human life, has no intrinsic value.)<twoWYES>: And who decides who gets culled? Is it a central government endeavour or do the people with the means (primarily military technology company executives) decide?<etheral333>: Likely it'd be decided by wealth and influence followed by those who are selected by those two groups for whatever reason. So people with the means.<twoWYES>: I can't say I'm too keen on BAE systems and Lockheed Martin in cooperation with the US and Chinese governments deciding the fates of billions of lives. I'm not saying I disagree with your basic principle, I just think it needs a little work to be more compassionate and accountable.<etheral333>: I get that and agree with you on the first part. As for the second part, why are compassion and accountability required? While we might want them I don't think they are needed.<twoWYES>: Because you've entirely failed to answer who 'they' are with any specificity, and I'm utterly unconvinced arms companies and governments are either sufficiently competent to decide or sufficiently competent to perform the cull without bungling the job. I think it is only with compassion and accountability observed at all times that such a cull could be done without 1) destroying the social fabric of the remaining 3%, 2) destroying the machinations of economy upon which they rely, and 3) causing human suffering greater than anything in our history as a species. And if those are the costs then I reject the scheme entirely and believe it more rational to attempt to accomodate and placate the many.<etheral333>: Hmm i think we agree on most things. I think we have only a few fundamental differences that prevent us from being completely in agreement. I agree that \"they\" (who could be anyone with the means) would likely bungle the job. I agree that most people like the idea of compassion and accountability. I just dont agree with the assumption to human life has intrinsic value. This ends up being a important for things like point 3 that you raised. Suffering is only relevant if the thing or person suffering matters to the person or thing causing its suffering cares. As for points 1 and 2 i see where you are coming from and agree. The only potential disagreement i see is that maybe the change after the fact could be objectively better than if it wasn't done.

Do koalas have raggedy breathing, or is there some other reason for their inclusion in the study? <ChipLady>: Maybe one researcher has just wanted a koala forever, and after years of waiting for a legitimate experiment to come along he just got fed up! So he just shoehorned it in to this one somehow. They were all just sitting around, planning the various tests and he's like, guys we need some neutral, nonhuman control group. Everybody seems slightly on board, so they start to discuss what kind of animal, monkeys are too human like, cats and rats breathe way too fast, some people are scared of dogs, so those are all no gos. And then he suggests a koala because some sciencey sounding reasons and bam! He's finally able to work with a koala! Mission accomplished! <vsync>: there's a philosophy podcast the presenter of which is obsessed with giraffes<ChipLady>: Because giraffes are awesome! One off my favorite animals! I love getting a chance to feed them. <vsync>: this is bad because if they don't have to stretch their necks to eat then the necks of offspring will be shorter and eventually giraffes won't be tall any more<ChipLady>: I've only ever fed them from a pretty high platform at the zoo and once in a drive thru safari. But I think at both places their main source of food is higher, and the guest feedings are just treats. I know the zoo limits the feeding times, and since giraffes eat between 70-80 pounds of food a day I'm not sure they reach near that with just a few leaves of lettuce or whatever per visitor. But I will definitely look into the places I visit and make sure they are providing an appropriate height for the main food source before I participate. Thanks for teaching me something today! I'd hate to accidentally be a detriment to a species I adore. <vsync>: now I can't tell if you're trolling by pretending to take me seriously... was expecting to be scolded about Lamarckian theories and say something smug about epigenetics well played if so what zoo do you visit to feed them anyway?<ChipLady>: I was on some pain killers and super loopy and I totally took you seriously.

But sure, please go on about how legal immigration to the US is broken and impossible.<musicotic>: Not per capita<heelspencil>: That is correct, although I don't know how it is relevant. <EDIT>: Measuring things per capita only makes sense when those things scale on a per capita basis. I do not think immigration rate scales with the existing population size of a country.<musicotic>: Quantity is irrelevant and decontextualized without considering the total population (i.e. calculating the rate / per capita value). It's not very convincing to have the 'most immigrants in the world' when the country is the third largest. <heelspencil>: How do you figure? There are a lot of things that scale with population, but I wouldn't expect immigration rate to be one of them. I imagine that very high population density (i.e. overpopulation) would actually scale inversely with immigration rate, for example. There may be other factors that are more significant than population as well, such as economic or environmental factors. The laws and policies in place in the US do, in fact, process a million legal immigrants each year. If those policies made legal avenues to immigration \"useless\", then I wouldn't expect that many people to get through. <EDIT>: I didn't realize that immigration rate could mean immigrant population per general population. I am talking about immigrants per year.<musicotic>: no, i'm saying that the raw number of immigrants is pointless without saying how many people live in the country a (not real and exaggerated example) country a has 1 billion people and lets in 13,000 people per year country b has 600,000 and lets in 8,000 per year it looks like country a has the more generous immigration policy based on raw numbers, but per capita is much much lower. <heelspencil>: I understand what you are saying, but I disagree. There is no evidence at all that immigration rate scales with population size. You might as well rate countries by per capita temperature to determine how hot they are. If you look at net immigration versus population there is no correlation at all. China and India have negative immigration rates despite having the largest populations in the world by a large margin. If you ignore \"outliers\", you still end up with countries like Chad having a similar total immigration (not per capita) as the UK despite having a quarter the population. On the other end you have Spain, Mexico, and Libya with similar negative net immigration and vastly different population sizes. Population \\*does not matter\\* when considering immigration rate, these numbers are irrelevant to each other.<musicotic>: again, that's absolutely not what i'm saying. i'm not saying that larger countries have a higher immigration rate (that would be silly, we're using a rate), i'm saying that you're comparing ***raw numbers***. the ***rate*** is what we want. rate is per capita, raw numbers are not. 31.4% of saudi arabia's population is foreign 30.6% of oman's 54.7% of bahrain's 23.6% of gabon's 70% of kuwait's <https>://www.npr.org/2014/10/29/359963625/dozens-of-countries-take-in-more-immigrants-per-capita-than-the-u-s this article articulates what i'm trying to convey here much better. &gt;Population *does not matter* when considering immigration rate, these numbers are irrelevant to each other. you're right, population doesn't matter when you're considering immigration ***rate*** because you've already considered population. rate = # of immigrants / total population. <heelspencil>: A \"rate\" is a comparison between two things. You are comparing the population of immigrants to the general population of a country. I am comparing the number of immigrants entering a country to a period of time (per year). Unfortunately \"immigration rate\" is commonly used to mean immigrants per year (1M per year US), total immigrants per population (44M/300M = 13.5% in the US), or even immigrants per year per population (1M/300M = 0.3%). I don't think any of these are a good measure of a country's immigration policy unless the values are extreme. The person I was responding to said it was essentially impossible to enter the US legally, which is ridiculous. I don't know what point you are trying to make, maybe we should start there.<musicotic>: &gt;The person I was responding to said it was essentially impossible to enter the US legally i wouldn't say 'essentially impossible', but amerika is known for having ridiculous immigration laws: https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/01/immigration-flowchart.gif&amp;w=1484&amp;op=resize&amp;opt=1&amp;filter=antialias&amp;t=20170517 regardless, the per capita stat is definitely more useful that the raw number of immigration permitted because again, the # of immigrants admitted has a different context based on population. letting 2% of the population in is huge, .3% much less so", "num_messages": 14, "avg_score": 17.6428571429}

Newly developed learning models, similar to models within artificial intelligence research, show how planning in ravens and great apes can develop through prior experiences without any need of thinking. <jimb2>: Associative learning is like Pavlov's dogs. The bell rings, the food appears. The dogs start to associate the bell with food and salivate when they hear the bell. They don't have to think conceptually about the relationship of the food to the bell, it's a learned association. Thinking is different. You have and internal model and you choose an action based on the model. You are give one coin and shown two vending machine. You are told that one dispenses food and the other one dispenses water. You're hungry. Someone goes to one machine and gets water. You deduce that you should put your coin in the other machine. There is no chance of associative learning telling you to do this, you have never seen food come out of either vending machine. You are using an internal model with vending machine and contents to make the decision, an \"if this then that\" process. What this research does is show that behaviour like making a tool to get food that was thought to involve conceptual modelling by crows etc, can be done by an associate learning machine. This is just like an AI chess neural network machine doesn't have to think \"if I take the rook then...\" it just has a move quality number based on a pile of past experience and chooses the higher number for available moves. The chess machine can look like it is planning - eg doing a sacrifice - when it is not planning at all, it is just choosing best move numbers.

Sorry I had to erase formatting due to URL formatting. I do believe this means that thinking and intelligence are actually two different things.<jimb2>: There's a lot of evidence that a lot of what we call thinking is more like retrospective narrativization. It appears that consciousness is more like a big picture review system that feeds back into decision-making processes than our intuition of a mystical spiritual being that is the source of free will. I recently read and recommend Nick Chater's *The Mind Is Flat.* He has has a lot to say on this. Animal brains can do a lot of powerful stuff, but we humans own narratives. <altheist>: I was just comparing this study with neuron counts of animals vs. humans. Thanks though.<jimb2>: What I was meaning was that human conscious intelligence might be partly a case of hindsight, or more correctly an ability to make a story out of what they did. It seems pretty obvious to me that you can't solve a Sudoku - at least the way we do - without abstract thought, but a lot of our presumed intelligence comes down to post hoc narrativization. So, if a dog could create a narrative of what it did, it might decide it was intelligent. What happens is we make up stories for some of the smart stuff dogs do and project a human-like intelligence onto them. <altheist>: \"What happens is we make up stories for some of the smart stuff dogs do and project a human-like intelligence onto them.\" &lt; we do that with lots of animals and for good reason too - we share brain structure types with these animals.

Millions can to the Kaaba every year due to religious obligation only because the Saudis let them. That stewardship lends a degree of legitimacy and authority no other nation has. You only have to look back to 1979, and again in '87, to see how that has come into play. Being the custodian of the holy sites gives them theological sway by default.<LunaLoonLooney>: *let them* No. The Saudis do not have the authority to disallow any Muslim to perform the Hajj, because they are simply custodians. They impose things like quotas mainly because of a safety aspect, and also, to allow those who have yet to perform the Hajj, priority over those who have already done it. *gives them theological sway by default* Again, no. How they practice Islam is different from how someone in East Asia practices it, which is different from how someone in South Asia practices it, etc. <cvardy1998>: They absolutely do have the authority to disallow anyone from entering the county, that's the nature of it. There's nothing stopping them from closing the borders. You mention yourself the safety aspect, if Iran tried something again like thirty years ago, Saudis could easily shut everything down in the name of national defense. And yeah, I don't disagree that Islam is differently practiced globally, but Hajj is universal throughout the major sects. <LunaLoonLooney>: Safety because of overcrowding and preventing stampedes. Yes, if that was tried again, they could shut their borders. But they\u2019ll eventually still have to re-open it again in some form, be it with more controls, way stringent checks, limiting those who perform the Hajj only that and nothing else, nor go anywhere else. Because they cannot prevent Muslims from performing the Hajj, for they are custodians and Islam does not belong to them. Yes, Hajj is universal throughout the sects, and there is no way to sway it theologically or otherwise. <cvardy1998>: Safety regardless, and if they shut down the borders in any capacity, regardless of ethics or Hermeneutics, they can shut them down in all capacities. They entirely can prevent Muslims for performing Hajj because the sites are controlled by them. The sway comes with that, they could demand that every country has to donate for them to keep their borders open to Hajj in the next year and no one could stop them save through coercion, but Saudi Arabia is unique in that capacity.", "num_messages": 14, "avg_score": 3.3571428571}

Have you? <Gumbyizzle>: For many years, yes. <CrushHazard>: Then how are you unable to produce even a sentence in support of your baseless accusation?<Gumbyizzle>: What baseless accusation have I made? Your claim that industry scientists don\u2019t do real science is baseless and makes you sound like someone who is unfamiliar with industry research. I thought we had enough contributions from others on that front, so I didn\u2019t elect to pile on. Since you\u2019re requesting a more fleshed-out response, I can say from my own experience that industry science in the biomedical field is extremely robust and involves discussion among top experts about the best approaches to find practical answers to meaningful questions. The practice is highly scientific, and the rigor applied is by necessity beyond what is typically applied in academic research. <CrushHazard>: You accused me of having no clue what goes on in industry. That is baseless. I\u2019ll just say that every time I have been paid to produce a specific result and back it up with \u201cscience\u201d, it\u2019s not real science. <Gumbyizzle>: Sounds like you\u2019ve had some bad experiences with some shady organizations that bear no resemblance to the experiences of me or the others in this thread. Sorry to hear it. Please don\u2019t judge all of industry on that, though. Also, in my personal experience, that sounds a lot more like what happens in academic labs. <CrushHazard>: My academic lab was nothing like that. We were attempting to uncover the secrets of the universe. If the media wanted to spin our discoveries in a way that made them more money or if politicians wanted to spin it in a way that brought in more funding, that was their prerogative. We were doing the work purely for scientific reasons. No other motive. It sounds like perhaps you work in the medical field. I don\u2019t know anything specific about that industry. Perhaps in that industry, a true scientific discovery is so valuable that you are allowed to produce non-profitable result after non-profitable result without the company getting upset about it. Perhaps there are objective scientific reviews on your work to discourage corner-cutting and fudging of the details. If so, that is unique, and cones from the public-private nature of your industry and the intensive regulatory framework. That would make it the exception to the rule. In my industry, PhDs essentially sell their scientific souls (if they ever had one) to make a ton of money. Their degree \u201clegitimizes\u201d the targeted results they produce using obfuscated methods and theories that range from questionable to unproven. It\u2019s a great place for people who got deep enough into their major that they considered it a sunk cost but suffered through their studies for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Perhaps they weren\u2019t as talented as their peers or because their egos got so big that they abandoned any notion of scientific objectivity. They took tests, wrote papers and perhaps even discovered facts all while \u201cpersonally disagreeing\u201d with the results. These types are perfect targets for industry people to exploit. In my industry, no one dies if we are wrong. Correctness is relative. No one repeats our \u201cexperiments\u201d. Even basic facts are not checked. People judge our results on personal beliefs \u2014 especially political beliefs. There is science there, but not enough to call it science. <JealousOfHogan>: I like how you never name your made up discipline.<CrushHazard>: I addressed it in a PM.

Chicago anyone? <nhavar>: That's like saying that outlawing murder creates more murderers, it's technically true but stupid all the same. Plus how do you criminalize lawfully abiding citizens. You are either a law abiding citizen or you are not. If the government regulates guns and you don't abide by the law you are by definition NOT a law abiding citizen. They don't make you into that, you choose to be that. Example, man has dementia and the government has said that he needs to transfer ownership of his guns to a family member or they may be confiscated. His mental health does not allow for him to have access to a firearm. His family has decided that it's a stupid law they don't agree with. That's not the government making them criminals, that's a choice they are actively making with full awareness of a law they don't agree with. There are multiple factors that impact Chicago's gun violence including more lax gun regulation in border states, poverty, education, employment, and population density. Chicago gets picked on but it's not even the worst place, there are 3-4 other cities that are worse. But Chicago is liberal city in a state with heavy gun control so it's an easy target.

I've linked it above as well. Its pretty ironic to complain about a misinterpretation of \"well regulated militia\" when you are the one failing to interpret it as a legal term.<matthewtheninja>: Not seeing where it defines the term, can you pull out the relevant text?<PrimeLegionnaire>: From P179 &gt;The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that **the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense**... &gt; And further, that ordinarily, when called for service these men were expected to appear **bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time**. emphasis mine.<matthewtheninja>: That just defines 'militia'. It says nothing about the \"well-regulated\" portion which is the portion I am talking about. There is no reason pre-DC v Heller to assume that the \"well-regulated\" portion of the amendment does not give the federal, state or local governments the ability to restrict access to firearms.<PrimeLegionnaire>: [Here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246) is the US Federal Code defining the term Militia &gt;(a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard. &gt;(b) The classes of the militia are\u2014 &gt;(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and &gt;(2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia. &gt;(Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 14, \u00a7 311; Pub.

I am talking about the legal implications of the phrase \"well-regulated\".<PrimeLegionnaire>: From all of that context about what the word militia means you think there is a reasonable definition of \"well regulated\" that excludes the inclusion of the unorganized militia, especially given the context that the experts on the subject say it does include the unorganized militia?", "num_messages": 21, "avg_score": 370.4285714286}

I've only been interrogated by a cop WRT a criminal investigation one time. I told them what I knew. Later, I read the police report. Much of it was about how I did not have the body language of someone who was lying.<rich000>: TBH I find this a bit concerning. Imagine giving responses to the police truthfully and the report says that your body language suggested that you were lying. Maybe you're just bad at expressing yourself. IMO the police would be better off focusing on gathering actual evidence and not trying to document behavioral cues (at least not subtle ones). Now, if you gave contradictory responses that may or may not be significant and those responses should be documented. If your behavior was suspicious that should be noted (as in what you actually did, like loitering near a place that was robbed). Those things are still circumstantial but at least they're fairly objective and could be considered holistically. Merely accepting or rejecting a verbal account based on body language seems risky.<oversoul00>: Body language is just one piece of the puzzle, no one is getting convicted based solely on body language. Most times there is a huge lack of damning evidence otherwise of course we'd use that. If the husband has no emotional reaction when learning that his wife has been murdered that should absolutely be taken into consideration. <rich000>: Good thing my wife died in a hospital then. A police investigation would have been the last thing I needed. I don't really tend to express emotion much, and I imagine I'm not the only one. <oversoul00>: You aren't the only one and I'm right there with you, but we are in the minority...it only makes sense that the police would craft their investigation around what most people would do rather than what the minority would do. <rich000>: Well, studies have shown is that what most people do is give inaccurate information even when they're not trying to be deceptive...<oversoul00>: Yeah because humans are imperfect and the system is imperfect as a result. The police have to interview people and ask them questions. During that process the police will analyze the situation to try and understand if people are lying or hiding something and their impressions will be noted. I mean, have you never talked to someone to try and determine what they know and have you ever thought that person was lying to you? Has that suspicion ever caused you to ask more or different questions than you normally would have? The police are no different. What is your alternative? What are you suggesting?<rich000>: I have no issues with the police asking questions. I have no issues with warrants being issued if people claim to have witnessed things. I'm not really keen on pursuing people merely because they responded to a question in a way that the investigator disapproved of or treating that as probable cause. But, it isn't like anybody is doing to listen to my opinion on the matter. People like simple stories that confirm their biases, which is probably why so many people are falsely convicted based on eyewitness testimony. Police and juries alike think they can tell when they're hearing the truth. <oversoul00>: &gt; I'm not really keen on pursuing people merely because they responded to a question in a way that the investigator disapproved of or treating that as probable cause. I wouldn't use the word 'disapprove', what if we change that to 'find suspicious'. Should investigators be on the lookout for suspicious people and is it okay for that suspicion to originate in a conversation? Put yourself in the investigators shoes for a second. You are talking to a suspect and they seem abnormally nervous and they are giving you vague and hasty answers. That's not a crime and they could just be a nervous person who doesn't want to talk to the police. It could also be an indication that they know something pertinent to the investigation that they aren't telling you right? Would you not ask this person some more questions than you normally would? I completely agree that people are biased and that the system is imperfect but again I'm not sure what your alternative is. Just ignore all social cues because they could be wrong? Does suspicion not exist for you? Should suspicion not exist for investigators? We agree that there should be many steps between a suspicious encounter and a conviction and there typically are. <rich000>: I WOULD use the word \"disapprove.\" That is, unless there is some actual study backing their criteria. But, I get that everything you're saying is stuff just about every police officer and jury member would consider normal. This is why I try to avoid situations where I might become a criminal suspect and would probably avoid talking to the police at all unless advised by an attorney who is present.

Diversification does not equate to importance for study and neither does it have quite the level of import I think you're giving it.

I'm not one for relaxing (I like to always be *doing* something, even when using the restroom or whatever), but if it helps me feel better and potentially get more done by improving focus, I'll try it.<winknod>: Think of meditation this way, it's a few minutes out of your day where you completely disassociate from everything around you. No phone, no internet, no deadlines, no chores, no nagging spouse, etc. Sure those things will all still be there when you're done meditating but for the present moment they are not weighing you down. The mind craves silence. You know when you're first working out after not working out for a long time the exercise is hard? It will be the same with meditation. First your mind will resist but if you keep at it it will become easier over time. Don't be discouraged.

I mean if there is a difference between 2 and 3 and they think there are many situations this 3d matters, why not have 0 tolerance on alcohol? What are the moral justifications of allowing 2 and not 3?<dcheesi>: For one thing, there are a number of metabolic processes that can lead to someone having a non-zero BAC without even drinking. The real reason, I think, is that social drinking, pairing wine with food, etc. are all embedded in the culture. If someone couldn't have a glass of wine with dinner, that would be an almost unprecedented disruption of cultural traditions, which begins to harken back to Prohibition. The practical argument being that, just as in Prohibition, if you try to criminalize a reasonable and culturally acceptable level of drinking, then everyone will get used to ignoring the law and wind up driving even when they're truly drunk. You want to find a legal limit that's somewhat feasible for the average person, and single out for penalty those who exceed that reasonable limit. That way the cultural norms can adapt to the law, rather than rejecting it wholesale.<Krotanix>: It's curious how a glass of wine or a beer is seen as a must for some people for social events. This amount of alcohol produces no noticeable effect afaik while you could have other fancy drinks. Juices, smoothies, soft drinks or similar. I was not suggesting to forbid alcohol, just wondering why there is such a low limit for driving different from 0. <dcheesi>: Well I think you hit on it there a little bit. The perception, at least, is that a single drink doesn't create significant impairment, so where's the harm in allowing it? People value freedom of choice, and many alcoholic beverages have unique flavor profiles that aren't easily replicated in non-alcoholic beverages. So why not let people enjoy those flavors along with their food and/or socializing? Especially when \"that's what we've always done\"? I also think that there's a bit of double-think involved here, in that people value a drink or two for the perceived relaxation effect, yet they'll argue that they don't even feel the effects in terms of impairment. I think some of this could be explained by pavlovian triggers and/or placebo effect, where just tasting the alcohol puts people in a more relaxed, sociable mindset. <Krotanix>: I see what you say. Personally I don't care about it, my only intention with all this was to point out the arbitrarity of alcohol limits. Where do you draw the line? 1, 2, 3... 4? I mean, there doesn't seem to be any specific reason for the values set my the law. So if they are just arbitrary to allow some drink but not too much, why change it from 0.08 to 0.05 in the first place? It's like you have 8 cents in your pocket and you decide to leave 3 cents at home so you have only one 5 cents coin, but you aren't going to do much with either 5 or 8 cents, and in any case the weight is irrelevant, so why even care at all?<dcheesi>: A couple of reasons come to mind: First, that the lower limit might actually better reflect that not-impaired-yet level, and thus it would be more appropriate. Of course not everyone is equally impaired at a given BAC level, and the degree of impairment is likely a sliding scale rather than a sharp cliff. So in part it comes down to whether you want to give the benefit of the doubt, or be more conservative. Second, progressively lowering the limit can be part of that cultural adaption thing I mentioned. Start out with a high limit that only ensnares obviously dangerous drivers, and once society has adjusted to that, you lower it to catch subtly impaired drivers, etc. At each stage, you allow plenty of time for the cultural norms to shift and adjust to the new standard. This is likely to be much more effective than a sudden imposition of the strictest standard from the beginning.", "num_messages": 11, "avg_score": 112.2727272727}

It uses this mechanism to be more efficient. Essentially, when there aren't many of the bacteria around, they won't have enough of the signaling molecule to turn on the lytic program of the phage (this is desirable to the phage, because less susceptible bacteria around means the phage can't subsequently infect other bacteria after it goes through replication and host cell lysis).

Phage are typically very specific in what bacteria they can infect, so if you gave a phage that infects E coli to Staph, it won't be able to imfect staph. The degree of difference in recognotion of the host is too much. And when it comes to humans, that degree of difference is much greater.

The fact that their suicide rates are even higher doesn't make the first problem any better. <EDIT>: Wow, I didn't expect to hit a US-conservative nerve this hard with something as self-evident at this. Huh!<ganath83>: Those \u201cdeveloped western countries\u201d you mentioned, what\u2019s their regular old homicide rate including everything but guns and adjusted for population? I hear London is a wonderful place to visit right now. <Dave37>: What are you trying to argue? My point is that the US has a high risk of firearm homicide. Is that not accurate? Isn't the homicide rate in the US significantly higher than in for example the UK?<Oktayey>: So? Why does firearm homicide matter any more than non-firearm homicide?<Dave37>: &gt; So? Why does firearm homicide matter any more than non-firearm homicide? Because firearm homicide is a lot easier to commit. Thats why firearm homicide is 730% of the remaining homicides in the US but only 5% in for example the UK. regulating firearms properly would be the most effective way to get homocide rates to drop in the US. That's why it matters. <Oktayey>: That makes no sense. You're saying the reason firearm homicide is more important than non-firearm homicide is because firearm homicide is easier to commit? If that's the case, why aren't you addressing homicide attempts instead of homicides? Let's also not forget that killing somebody in self defense is also homicide. Are you saying that's bad too?<Dave37>: Why is this so hard to get? If the US has a homicide rate that's 5 times as high as most European countries and 88% of the homicides are due to intentional firearm homicides, wouldn't it be sensible to review the ways firearms are regulated? And I know, the US has a lot of other problems as well. you have to review your institutionalized racism, your wealth inequality, your healthcare system, your educational system, your well-fare system, the public transport system, the constitution (which is the world's most outdated constitution), the voting system, the political system, your environmental policies, press freedom, military doctrine and the prison system. But pointing around in a circle going \"no, deal with this problem instead first\", isn't really going to help, now will it? So while you deal with all the rest that you need to fix to stop being the world's richest third world country, wouldn't it be sensible to also look into some gun reforms, as that should be relatively easy to get passed in congress? How is this so hard to grasp for so many Americans!?<Oktayey>: You just said that firearm homicide is more important than non-firearm homicide because it's easier to commit, yet you cited successful homicide numbers. How does that make sense? Also, the US doesn't have a gun problem. Guns are used in self defense more than they are used in violent crime.<Dave37>: &gt; You just said that firearm homicide is more important than non-firearm homicide because it's easier to commit, yet you cited successful homicide numbers. How does that make sense? They are easier to commit because pointing towards someone at a distance with a boom stick and then pulling a trigger and watching them falling over is less psychologically and physical demanding than having to stab or strangle someone to death. Is this really something that you need to see statistics for!? &gt; Also, the US doesn't have a gun problem You're absolutely right, you have intentional firearm homicide problem. &gt; Guns are used in self defense more than they are used in violent crime. How is this even remotely relevant?<Oktayey>: &gt;They are easier to commit because pointing towards someone at a distance with a boom stick and then pulling a trigger and watching them falling over is less psychologically and physical demanding than having to stab or strangle someone to death. I know that. What doesn't make sense is that you claimed that firearm homicide is more important than non-firearm homicide because it's easier to commit. However, if that was the case, you'd care about the number of attempted homicides instead of successful homicides. &gt;How is this even remotely relevant? It's relevant because it shows that restricting guns would result in a loss of life.<Dave37>: &gt; I know that. What doesn't make sense is that you claimed that firearm homicide is more important than non-firearm homicide because it's easier to commit. However, if that was the case, you'd care about the number of attempted homicides instead of successful homicides. 88% (almost 90%) of successful homicides are due to intentional firearm use. You really think that it's likely that it's more than 10 times as hard to successfully commit a homicide with a firearm as through other means? &gt; It's relevant because it shows that restricting guns would result in a loss of life. No. How? You don' think that in a lot of cases these perpetrators are wearing guns themselves? Is it possible that sometimes the perpetrators doesn't try to kill the person they attack? Maybe they are trying to rob them, or threaten them, or hit them? You don't think that there are other legitimate ways of defending yourself successfully? You don't think that if the US culture changed so that people wasn't afraid of suddenly potentially being killed by a ranged weapon that's easily to conceal the need for self-defence actions would decrease? I mean all this is so clear because you know, the US has a much higher homicide rate than any other western country. So clearly having better gun laws leads to less homicides. The evidence is overwhelming. This is not a hypothetical scenario. The rest of the Western world is doing this and it works fine.<Oktayey>: &gt;88% (almost 90%) of successful homicides are due to intentional firearm use. You really think that it's likely that it's more than 10 times as hard to successfully commit a homicide with a firearm as through other means? What? I never said that. I'm saying that if ease of use was your focus, you'd be using homicide success rate data. &gt;You don't think that if the US culture changed so that people wasn't afraid of suddenly potentially being killed by a ranged weapon that's easily to conceal the need for self-defence actions would decrease? You're saying that criminals would comply with gun control? &gt;I mean all this is so clear because you know, the US has a much higher homicide rate than any other western country. So clearly having better gun laws leads to less homicides. Nope. There is no correlation between US state gun laws and their rates of violence.<Dave37>: &gt; What? I never said that. I'm saying that if ease of use was your focus, you'd be using homicide success rate data. That's not my point. I'm saying that if you're in the situation were you would feel the need to seriously hurt someone, potentially killing them, you would prefer to use a gun over, let's say knife or your bare hands. It's an easier psychological barrier to pass to pick up a gun and shoot someone than to go up to someone and stab them to death. That should be obvious. So limiting the availability on guns will most likely deter people from killing each other. Not to mention that most other weapons are less lethal. &gt; You're saying that criminals would comply with gun control? No but I'm saying border patrol and gun store owners will. I'm not saying there's a solution that will make all fire arm related violence go magically poff! But I'm saying that there's obviously ways to improve the situation quite massively. &gt; There is no correlation between US state gun laws and their rates of violence. Is the variation in US state gun laws large enough? If the laws are too similar then obviously there's not going to be any correlation because you've essentially controlled for differences in gun laws. That's like saying \"We've investigated behavioural differences in twins and no variation in behaviour can be explained by the differences in their genes and so genes do not affect behaviour\". I'm also not particularly interested in rates of violence, I'm interested in the rate of intentional fire-arm homicides. Can the stupid stop, please?<Oktayey>: It seems to me that you are worried about lawful gun owners more than criminals. &gt;Is the variation in US state gun laws large enough? If the laws are too similar then obviously there's not going to be any correlation because you've essentially controlled for differences in gun laws. Yes, very much so. The difference between Washington DC's laws and Montana's are extreme. <Dave37>: And you have proper boarder controls between all the states so that there's no flow of illegal weapons? The fact that one state has stringent gun laws kinda doesn't help if it's just a matter of getting your gun at your local grocery in Montana or whatever and driving over to Washington DC to shoot someone.

Luminescence and reactivity of a charge-transfer excited iron complex with nanosecond lifetime. Science, 2018; eaau7160 <DOI>: 10.1126/science.aau7160 <Link>: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/11/28/science.aau7160 Abstract Iron\u2019s abundance and rich coordination chemistry are potentially appealing features for photochemical applications. However, the photoexcitable charge-transfer (CT) states of most Fe complexes are limited by picosecond or sub-picosecond deactivation through low-lying metal centered (MC) states, resulting in inefficient electron transfer reactivity and complete lack of photoluminescence. Here we show that octahedral coordination of Fe(III) by two mono-anionic facial tris-carbene ligands can suppress such deactivation dramatically. The resulting complex [Fe(phtmeimb)2]+, where phtmeimb is [phenyl(tris(3-methylimidazol-1-ylidene))borate]-, exhibits strong, visible, room temperature photoluminescence with a 2.0 ns lifetime and 2% quantum yield via spin-allowed transition from a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (2LMCT) state to the ground state (2GS). Reductive and oxidative electron transfer reactions were observed for the 2LMCT state of [Fe(phtmeimb)2]+ in bimolecular quenching studies with methylviologen and diphenylamine.<fujidust>: I understood most of that but am a lay person. <Q>: For comparison, what\u2019s a typical deactivation time in rarer metals commonly and currently used in these applications today?<JahRockasha>: I'm not familiar with the term \"deactivation\" specifically but I believe they are referring to electronic states that result in non radiative processes. Generally if an electron can relax to a nonradiative state quickly, say within a few hundred nanoseconds then it probably would be a bad photoemitter(radiative). From what I've read having longer excitation times can result in a higher chance of the electron relaxing in a radiative process (emitting light) A little reading on femtosecond spectroscopy (transient absorption) on perovskite solar materials the relaxation time is in the few hundred nanoseconds. Perovskites are just crystal structures that can have many different components and uses such as LEDs, solar cells, and semiconductors. Iron is often considered a luminescent quencher. In fluorescent gemstones like fluorite if iron is present the gem is no longer luminescent (glow in a black light). Hope that helps a little.", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 249.5}

The article you cited (a wiki article when talking about medicine *sigh*) says the law was put into effect to eleviate the financial strain of false accusations. This is a US law.

Yes, I understand the more people who cant catch something means there will be less people catching it... but the problem is vaccines dont prevent you from catching the disease.

Everything I've read says you can, i didnt think that was up for debate.<sillythaumatrope>: Refer to the second paragraph of my last comment.

[deleted]: Literally every single variable in life is on a spectrum. It\u2019s funny how the word gets tossed around like a eureka moment in 2018. You\u2019d think we\u2019d have figured it out by now.<Littlebelo>: Human brains like to categorize things in black and white definitions. Remembering that most things exist as a spectrum is a constant fight against that natural instinct<Caedro>: It makes sense to classify things quickly like that in a more natural situation. I generalize quickly that the Tiger is dangerous, regardless of the individual aggression of that tiger. It is interesting that to evolve our thinking we must fight against that natural instinct.<Littlebelo>: It *is* super interesting. There are whole classes you can take on how society and civilization require us to go against some basic instincts now that are basic needs (sustenance, safety, etc) can be easily met, but other instincts are required for civilization to function. I could go on and on but that would take far too long<icywaterfall>: No, please, go on.<Littlebelo>: Oh boy oh boy &amp;#x200B; One of the most interesting ones (imo) to think about is how we've totally hijacked the hormones that control our metabolism (which I'm using as an overarching term for the chemical processes that dictate how we process energy, even though its typically a more general term) by having our basic nutritional needs met so easily by society. There are a few hormones that tell us more or less when we're supposed to be hungry, tired, energetic etc etc. What's interesting is that when we learned to cook the right meats and grains and have them readily available (the advent of livestock and crops), society immediately followed. And now, its gotten to the point where our food is so energy and nutrient-dense that our bodies send conflicting messages. Our stomach is physically empty-ish so that causes us to stop releasing gastrin (one of the \"full\"-hormones). This tells the body that it's ready to eat again. However, at the same time, there is a ton of energy being processed in the gut, which is going to cause high blood sugar and trigger the release of insulin (the major \"full\" hormone). So now you have conflicting signals on whether or not you want to eat again. This is one of many reasons (imo) that the whole \"eat when you're hungry\" diet-plan doesn't always work as well as it should. &amp;#x200B; Another fun thing to look at is the role of parental/reproductive instincts in society. Society developed around single-nuclear families. The desire to reproduce is one of the strongest and most intense that living things have, since it is essentially the basis of life to survive long enough to pass chemical/genetic information on to the next generation so that they can do the same. And if you look long enough you can see it permeate everything we do. The purely logical thing to do in life is never have kids (if you live in a first world country), since having a dependent is a resource-depleting and time-consuming process that lasts decades, but from the very beginning of civilization, that has been the focus. Work to put bread on the table for everyone, make yourself more attractive (both socially and physically) so that you have the best options for reproduction, even most religions place a huuuge emphasis on the importance of family. And once you look at all that, you can look at everything we do to try and counteract that. Fewer couples are having kids. Beauty standards are evolving to incorporate non-traditional definitions of beauty. So many things are a constant back-and-forth between what we have evolved to have a tendency towards, and what we can objectively step back and look at as logical/utilitarian &amp;#x200B; ..... you weren't being sarcastic, were you?<Zenanii>: &gt; The purely logical thing to do in life is never have kids &amp;#x200B; This might hold true for first world countries, or if you don't plan to live past 60, but if you live in a poorer country you'll rely on your offspring to take care of you when you grow old and feeble. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, very interesting read.<Littlebelo>: That\u2019s true. I didn\u2019t really think of that. Good point!!<bambispots>: This is one of my concerns. We have no children. He doesn\u2019t want any. Who will care for us when we can\u2019t care for ourselves? I\u2019ve already seen numerous friends and family members struggle with this. No one to care for them. <godspareme>: The goal is, by having no or few children, to have more money. You'll be able to live in a retirement home or have nurses and such. Most people don't get that, unfortunately. <KislevNeverForgets>: Just out of curiosity, when you said \"most people don't get that\" did you mean, \"most people don't understand that\" or \"most people don't attain that\" Not disagreeing or anything just looking for clarity as English is not my first language, i feel like it could mean either without context.<bambispots>: Retirement homes and nurses means care by obligation rather than love. And its sad to see the amount of abuse that can happen in some of those places. (And Yes I know family members are also sometimes the culprits it just seems less likely to me) <Jaredismyname>: Well it also isn't really fair to expect family to do what amounts to a part time job without pay either.<bambispots>: Other cultures manage really well with these kinds of arrangements, and much of the time grandparents help raise grandchildren.

They think about other's feelings.<DeeDoubs>: There is no such thing as an unselfish person, only people who want to be seen as unselfish for fundamentally selfish reasons.<superm8n>: I knew and know one. I can say unselfish people do exist, but they are very rare. If you look a bit harder and in the right places, you also will find one.<DeeDoubs>: I'm not saying people aren't capable of being good people or anything like that. But we are ultimately good for selfish reasons. You want your morality to prevail, you want your family and friends to prevail, you want your ideas to prevail, you want the people around you to prevail, and ultimately you want your species to prevail. At a surface level that might not seem to contradict with altruism, but at the center of all of those groups is you and you just sort of work your way out from there to incorporate the different groups that include you or at least your ideas. Ultimately, everyone is competing for who gets to be at that center.<superm8n>: Nope. Not everyone. Most everyone.<DeeDoubs>: I suppose in the most technical sense you are correct. People in a persistent vegetative state aren't selfish. But since we live in a world where the vast majority of people are selfish actors (at the very least in the sense that you and yours may be of a lower sphere of importance to them than them and theirs), people can't rationally act as if we are all part of some universal collective.<superm8n>: The question would be... How do we get the world to follow the unselfish ones?<DeeDoubs>: Do you really want people to follow people with no aspirations? I think the desire for glory (and note that glory doesn't necessarily mean fame or praise, it often comes from within) does both good and bad of course, but it is essential for improvement.<superm8n>: Surely one of the best aspirations is to be a giving person, instead of just a taker, a \"black hole\" of sorts in the world? Heroes without capes are what I am thinking of. Fame and fortune does not have to be sought, just to become an unselfish human being. <DeeDoubs>: Well again, selfishness is about more than just the self. There's the question of who you give to and to what ends. Altruism frequently works along group dynamics the same as anything else. But at the end of the day, people who practice it want to shape the world to their own desires. That's not a bad thing. I'm not trying to imply that it's a bad thing. It's just important to realize that you can't really operate on the assumption that an altruistic person is altruistic to universally positive ends and there are enough competing interests that there will always be conflict.<superm8n>: Speaking of conflicts, you reminded me of this; right-left light-dark altruistic-selfish male-female strong-weak full-empty positive-negative The natural way that the universe works would dictate that a **giver** is the opposite of a **selfish** person. Just harmonizing with this natural law on the scale of one person makes a huge change in the surroundings. <DeeDoubs>: See, I don't see things that way. Your right is my left (assuming we are face to face of course), darkness is the consequence of something else standing in the way of a light source, becoming illuminated itself while preventing it from reaching my eyes, and when some 9th century viking leader raided some village to rob them of their resources it was ultimately altruistic because he was risking his life to provide for his people. Everything is a matter of perspective.<superm8n>: Those rules transcend humanity. They exist without us.<DeeDoubs>: How do right and left exist without an observer?<superm8n>: I am tempted to ask you why they need one to exist. There are things that exist without human intervention.<DeeDoubs>: Not *human* intervention, an observer. Left and right are defined by the orientation of the observer and not on any kind of absolute coordinate basis. A lot of the things you described are like that. Something only seems weak in the presence of stronger things for instance. Negative values don't actually exist, they are an abstract concept that we use for solving problems. Whether liquid is stored in a container or thrown across some surface is only of particular consequence if someone or something wants to move it. It's not actually that they don't exist, they just aren't meaningful without an observer.<superm8n>: So you do not think left and right would exist without human intervention. This is similar to the; \"chicken and egg\", situation. I agree with your last sentence. I am talking about the most basic of existences, that without observers. Some would call that absolute truth. The inherent truth in what I shared comes from something within us all. I can present the; \"Light-dark\", \"up-down\" and so forth in any language and get the same results without asking for the second word. Again, it is something naturally known within us. The basic binary of \"liar-___\" would be naturally filled with \"honest\". All humans seem to know it. It can be seen in the \"altruistic-_____\" , example we talked about earlier. The natural answer is; \"selfish\". **Natural law** is already placed within us to know these things. <DeeDoubs>: &gt;So you do not think left and right would exist without human intervention. Again, not *human* intervention. An observer. Left and right exist in the context of something that is capable of facing a direction and having that ability to face in a direction mean something. A dog can probably perceive left and right even if it doesn't have names for them. A statue on the other hand can only have an idea of left or right imposed on it by an observer deciding which side of that statue represents its front. Regardless, that's getting a bit off topic. I'm going to try to focus on the morality issues a little more. &gt;The basic binary of \"liar-___\" would be naturally filled with \"honest\". All humans seem to know it. A problem I have with this particular dichotomy that you are presenting is that it doesn't capture the nuance of being deceptive. A skilled deceiver employs truth far more than they employ lie. Plus whether or not lying is a function of honesty depends on context. A person who tells an old granny that they are looking beautiful is telling a lie most of the time, but they aren't really being dishonest, they are just engaging in a social function. Issues of morality are always wrapped in these issues of context and perspective. And that brings us back around to altruism vs selfishness - I simply don't believe it's as straight forward a dichotomy as you think because what you may perceive as altruistic from one angle may seem selfish from another. Suppose for instance I revolutionize farming to the point where people all over the world have a surplus of food. We grow to be able to support a population of 40,000,000,000 on Earth... I give this technology away for free, the population grows quickly over the next couple generations and people prosper for about... 200 years or so. The people of the future following that however have no resources to speak of, almost everything having been depleted by a massive population. Your act of altruism towards the people of the present will be seen as the selfishness of the past in the future. Part of the trouble with universal altruism is that there is an infinite number of ways that people can be divided and people simply can't account for them all. At some level, the center is always the self whether that's the center of a country, the center of a race, the center of an ideology, or even just the center of a period of time. <EDIT>: I'm reminded of the Buddhist concept of detachment. I see altruism and selfishness as reflections of a more base emotion, that being want. So I can't see them as opposites.<superm8n>: &gt; A dog can probably perceive left and right even if it doesn't have names for them. \u2022 They can... when taught by a \"human\". \u263a &gt; Suppose for instance I revolutionize farming to the point where people all over the world have a surplus of food. \u2022 I believe that would be called \"[vertical farming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/99xceh/las_vegas_has_a_new_30_million_vertical_farm_that/)\". \u2022 There could be a multitude of scenarios to formulate, according to the population example you gave. \u2022 Interesting that the Buddhist example was related to. Their \"universal symbol\" is yin-yan. (opposites) \u2022 I am talking about the most basic of basic operations of nature. Just as \"grey\" is in between \"black-white\", I am excluding the \"grey\" areas. I am just talking about the operation and existence of the natural law of opposites and applying them to the human personality, since all things come under that same natural law. &gt; At some level, the center is always the self whether that's the center of a country, the center of a race, the center of an ideology, or even just the center of a period of time. \u2022 Yes, the \"center\" is many times at the \"center\" of two opposites. This same natural law can be seen in your example of **\"time\"**. It would be; \"future-past\". <https>://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3b9osg/the_normal_movement_of_all_things_is_similar_to/<DeeDoubs>: &gt; Their \"universal symbol\" is yin-yan. (opposites) yin and yang is actually from Taoism, not from Buddhism. But if you delve a little more deeply into the subject you'll realize that the whole point of yin and yang is that the seemingly opposing elements are complementary rather than opposite. That's why it's not just a pair of semi-circles and each side of the symbol coils around while also containing a piece of the other.", "num_messages": 26, "avg_score": 12.6538461538}

The reason present reactors are cooled with standard water, is they can be placed next to a large body of water, with the reactor below water level. That way, if the reactor ever overheats, it can simply be flooded with cool, cheap, and plentiful water. It's a simple and effective negative feedback mechanism to prevent the main problem which can arise from nuclear reactors... [deleted]: I read the main reason USA went with current reactors was that they made plutonium, whereas LFTR/Thorium did not. Honestly the Pentagon wanted bombs not energy. Anyway, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima and more prove close proximity to water doesn't mean any advantage to melt down scenario. LFTR/Molten Salt/Thorium has a melt-able plug where fluid drains into a storage tank. The Molten Salt reactor in Oak Ridge, TN was commonly demonstrated to be ultra safe. The demonstration was to flip the off switch, totally de-power the reactor. Beside the main fact that Thorium LFTR will give energy for the remaining existence of mankind. I'm glad to see this move by Bill Gates. The USA gave China our research paper on Oak Ridge Molten salt a few years ago, and I could be wrong but we are involved in their start up to molten salt reactors. I heard India wants these reactors but USA refuses to sell them the plutonium required to start up a reactor. England has been running a molten salt reactor to dispose of their radioactive waste created by their nuclear program. A proven process and well past time to start the process of bringing them on line. It will be too late to halt the worst of global warming damage as it will probably take 50-100 years to build the power the earth with molten salt/LFTR/Thorium. If done right, there will small reactors outside every major city and secondary towns. If one fails the grid can adjust. The technology got it's start as a pet project of the US Air Force to have a tiny self contained reactor for nuclear bombers before accurate intercontinental missiles were perfected. Another positive any waste from Molten Salt is hotter than current reactor's but is safe with a few hundred years vs the the cooler waste of today reactors which aren't safe for thousands of years. But the Molten reactors as England does or did can use current waste for fuel. Plus a rare and expensive isotope used to place into tumors to burn them up, then quickly becomes dormant is a by product, a win for fighting cancer for sure.<tripperjack>: Interesting comment, but I see thorium reactors and molten salt coolant both mentioned in your comment and the linked article. I'm a layman to this, and want to be sure I understand. These are totally separate issues, right? The thorium is the fuel; the molten salt is the coolant. The Bill Gates backed project is just working on the molten salt coolant, but would use uranium, like traditional nuclear reactors. Is there any realistic chance that thorium reactors--which, as I understand it, are essentially completely safe and the fuel more plentiful--could become the standard?", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 10.75}

However, for the many that it helps treat depression or drug withdrawal, for example, it is an objectively healthier, safer and wiser drug to be on than SSRI's, other opiates or what-have-you. <Fadedcamo>: Do you have a source for that? I personally think that weed may help depression in the short term but can exasterbate the problem long term. It is a psychoactive drug that works on dopamine and pleasure centers like any other abusable substance (alcohol, cocaine, heroine) There are more complicated pathways to its effect but still I believe the effect on the dopamine pathways can lead to short term relief but long term detriment on effects such as depression. <drgnhrtstrng>: Anecdotally, weed makes most people I know very lazy, which can compound with depression and make its side effects at least worse<Rev1917-2017>: Weed doesn\u2019t make anyone lazy.
