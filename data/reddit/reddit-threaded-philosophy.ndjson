(Not entirely your fault; the article should be talking about the _mind_ and not the brain.) Even if there were no physical changes in the brain at all (there are, both at the cellular and subcellular levels), the mind is a standing waveform responding to stimuli. It stays mostly the same from moment to moment, but also every moment changes it; the data, the program being encoded and carried by the brain tissue. That program is never exactly the same from moment to moment, and enough of those moments may pass in your life for the mind to be completely different from birth to death, making the paradox accurate. But again, it's only accurate with respect to the mind, not the actual brain tissues, for the reasons you raised.<BobCrosswise>: Notably (though cynically unsurprisingly) the article doesn't even distinguish between brain and mind. I considered writing a response addressing just that, but decided not to even bother.

And before I access that memory and \"play it in my mind's ear\" it has to exist in a non-sounding form if that makes sense. Like a book that stores words that somehow correspond to sounds and meanings in our head but have no intrinsic sound and meaning themselves (for example for someone who doesn't know the language or the alphabet at all) <Wattsit>: You're just talking about your brain (memories) and we're back to the start.<shabusnelik>: A memory of a sound is different from the actual process of hearing a sound in your head though, isn't it? <SubtleMockery>: Yes.

It's just understood that if a claim is arbitrary and specific enough \u2013 e.g. eating two pounds of carrots cures blindness \u2013 the default rational response is to dismiss and ignore it, not to engage with it by defending or refuting it. But then, soon as we get to Abrahamic religion, suddenly it's all serious business. We have to *categorize*. Atheism and theism must be strictly defined and argued about until everyone's eyes glaze over.<Angel33Demon666>: I think that happens because there are many people who hold Abrahmic religions to be the literal truth of the Universe. That's why they require strict definitions in order to properly argue and defend their points. I'd think it's be the same if you were arguing against someone who sincerely believes in the Hellenic Pantheon, they'd require strict definitions and categories too.<sam__izdat>: The problem is, the apparent academic consensus on what constitutes atheism is stubbornly prescriptive, ascribing undue weight to arbitrary claims, and the \"shoe atheism\" alternative that they get so huffy about is so nebulous that it's basically useless. It increasingly seems to me like the terms serve very little purpose other than to muddy the waters. Like, was Einstein an atheist? That came up recently. Strictly speaking, he probably wasn't, but I would say that his position was stronger than strong, explicit atheism by miles: casually disregarding Abrahamic theology in the same way one disregards Greek mythology. The strongest response to arbitrary bullshit is not negation and counter argument (treating arbitrary statements as somehow worth considering) but just cold indifference. And somehow, that indifference makes one an agnostic when it comes to, say, Christians, but conspicuously not the ancient Greeks,.<Wittyandpithy>: From my perspective: 1. The term \u201catheist\u201d has been purposely hijacked and broadened to umbrella agnostics. This makes atheists seem to be more numerous than true, and takes advantage of and brands those who haven\u2019t substantively engaged in the topic. 2. Your interpretation of Einstein\u2019s attitudes on spirituality, mystery and God is massively over simplistic. You ought read all his commentary on and around the topic. If you had, then you\u2019d at least recognize his thoughts fluctuated over his lifetime. Moreover, he isn\u2019t overt towards God. He is overt towards certain religions. Don\u2019t cherry pick. 3. There is nothing wrong with saying \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have much respect for those who agonize over the question(s). If you are agnostic that doesn\u2019t equate to ambivalence.<tr14l>: Agnostic is an adjective. The second half of the phrase, the noun part, is \"atheist\". Because there's gnostic atheists and agnostic atheists. Saying you're agnostic doesn't make any sense... Agnostic what?<Wittyandpithy>: Saying you are without knowledge - in other words, you do not know whether there is or is not a god(s). <tr14l>: You're without knowledge... In general?<Wittyandpithy>: What do you label someone who doesn't have an opinion as to god(s) and knows nothing on the topic. In other words, how do you categorize the thoughts of a newly born baby? Using your taxonomy, a new born baby is an agnostic atheist. It is absurd. Saying you are agnostic in the context of a conversation makes sense. Given 'agnostic' is nearly always used in the context of thoughts as to spirituality and religion, the meaning is usually understood even without context. This is why, in NEARLY EVERY DICTIONARY IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, agnostic is listed as a noun and an adjective.<tr14l>: It's not absurd. It's the technical term. And a baby is TECHNICALLY lacking religion. But calling the term atheist usually had the connotation of understanding without belief. \"Agnostics\" are atheists. The atheists you're used to referring to are gnostic atheists.<Wittyandpithy>: Agnostics have not rejected nor necessarily even understood or considered reasons for existence of god(s). Have you ever been unsure of anything? Or unaware? Agnostics are not \u201cwithout god\u201d. They are undecided. Or ambivalent. Or ignorant. They are not atheist (or theist). <tr14l>: Go Google \"difference between agnostics and Anniston atheists\" Let me know what you find<Wittyandpithy>: Assuming we are looking at the same thing, are you just agreeing with me?<tr14l>: How they're never mentioned together? Then Google the difference between a gnostic atheist and agnostic atheist. Then, Google the definition of theism. If you're not that thing, then you're the other thing because it's a binary relationship. There's no magical third option. You're either a theist or you're not. Whatever REASON for the \"not\" is not relevant. You are still \"not\". Meaning atheist. This is the educated and technical use of the term needed to have meaningful discussion. If you can't get this concept I don't know what to tell you. This isn't me giving you my opinion. This is what that word means. \"Agnostic\" as a noun happened as a colloquialism and became widespread due to the misconception. It's not the \"new definition\" of the word, now negative the actual word.<Wittyandpithy>: You wont like what I'm about to say, but here is the bottom line: - we should strive to ensure language communicates true intent; - 'atheism' used to mean a positive belief that there is no God. They are 'without god'. Once this argument was undone using rationalism, 'atheists' sought to soften the meaning to be an ambivalent meaning - that they don't believe in, but don't reject the possibility, of the existence of God. - unfortunately, the word then loses its meaning and starts to overlap with agnosticism (inferring uncertainty). - so-called atheists (actually agnostics) didn't like what this symbolized: they they had conceded ground, so they fought very hard (over several decades) to advocate that meanings of atheism and theism, agnosticism and gnosticism which you posit But just because their revised meaning of atheism helps soothe their egos doesn't make their use of the terminology useful, or clear. Instead it muddies the water. We end up with babies being born as atheists (?), people who have never thought about the topic as atheists (?), people who are unsure, undecided, still learning and read, as atheists (?), people who believe in spirituality but aren't sure if there is a god as atheists (?). Should they be grouped together under the same label as someone who knows there is no god, and with someone who sees belief in god as dangerous (antitheists, also atheist)? It is ridiculous to group under one label. Those agnostics are not with or without god - they are undecided.<tr14l>: Yes, technically they are. There term \"atheism\" is a negation of \"theism\". Hence the negating prefix. You can do logic gymnastics all you want. That's what it means. You could make a case for more aptly named label for gnostic atheists. That would make more logical sense. But to just decide that a strict negative is no longer strictly a negative is silly and incorrect.<Wittyandpithy>: That\u2019s my point. For many, they have morphed the meaning of atheism from a strict negative to a apply to the strict negative AND a conditional negative AND an ambivalence AND an uncertainty. <tr14l>: No it's a strict negative. Theist = believes in God(s). Atheist = everyone else.<Wittyandpithy>: Atheist = doesn\u2019t believe god exists. Agnostic = does not know. <tr14l>: Cool story. Not how words work though. Have fun.<Wittyandpithy>: I accept language is living, and so your meaning is as 'valid' as mine and you can use language as you wish and I will defend your right to think and talk without fear of oppression. But that doesn't make your use of the language clear, or accurate. Your proposed meaning treats the topic as a yes/no question, instead of the spectrum that it truly is. Your proposed meaning defeats the purpose behind communication - to clearly convey what you mean. So I guess you get to have fun too, even if the way you use words causes confusion and has been driven by impure agendas.", "num_messages": 21, "avg_score": 14.1904761905}

Or, rather, it attempts to treat the Utilitarian or the Kantian as philosophical robots hellbent on acting out their moral tenets procedurally, but such a being does not exist. This doesn't disprove Utilitarianism or Kantianism but rather just means that the thought experiment is faulty. &gt; Your individual happiness, considered in the context of billions of conscious lives, is just a drop in the ocean. If doing the right thing for the general good \u2013 eg, selling your main assets and devoting the proceeds to charitable action \u2013 would make you unhappy, then that\u2019s a shame, but your unhappiness doesn\u2019t stop the right thing from being the right thing. This line of thinking violates a fundamental law of the universe: it asks that we create something from nothing. If I give away all my possessions, I am left with nothing left to give. Indeed, I then become dependent on others for aid and the net result is negative. Instead, a good Utilitarian or Kantian would act as a steward of their own possessions so as to subsist with stability, thus allowing them to generate more goods over a longer period of time which they can then give away. This applies not just to possessions but to happiness as well. It's harder for me to put happiness out into the world if I'm running myself ragged trying to make others happy. Self care is a perfectly fine thing for a Utilitarian to do. In fact, it is morally obligatory: you have a duty to yourself to try to get yourself in good working order and to avoid burnout. You are not a machine. You are a human. You should treat yourself like one. Of course most people probably spend too much time on what they pretend is self-care but is actually just harmful for them, but that's a different matter.<BoulderFalcon>: &gt;This applies not just to possessions but to happiness as well. Eh this is debatable and not a 1:1 in my opinion. Efforts given to make someone happy does not mean the same amount of happiness is taken away from me (as opposed to money where $1 given away is $1 lost from me). You can \"dish out\" happiness and not have it depleted from yourself. Some folks volunteer a lot of time at soup kitchens or other various charities, and while it may be tiresome and time consuming, they are often *happier* afterwards because they spent their time doing good for someone else. Thus both sides increase in happiness. This is of course different if you're bleeding yourself dry for someone else, or doing something that directly contributes to someone's happiness at the expense of yours (i.e. I'll pay for your vacation but now I can't go on one, I'll take your work shift today so you get a break but now I don't, etc.) I guess my point is that it's hard to quantify happiness and it doesn't function the same way as money, for instance. I'm sure any parent will tell you caring for a kid makes them happy but I bet they're exhausted. <BlaineTog>: There are two basic scenarios here: 1. You provide someone else happiness while also increasing your own happiness. 2. You provide someone else happiness at the expense of your own. The first scenario would obviously be preferable in every case but it isn't morally interesting. If I enjoy doing something that gives other people enjoyment as well, then I don't need a system of ethics to impel me to do that thing. as I'd be doing that thing regardless of whether I was a Utilitarian, a Kantian, or an uncarring, amoral jerk. The second scenario, however, is what we're interested in. This is the case of the \"happiness pump,\" a hypothetical individual who will do anything to make other people happy with total disregard to their own happiness. My contention is that this person is *not*, in fact, an ideal Utilitarian. Ideally, the Utilitarian saint would put as much good into the world as they can, even in situations that causes them to suffer, but they would also take time to ensure that they don't take in so much suffering that they burn out. A Utilitarian saint would be perfectly fine to read a fluff book for pleasure, to eat a fine meal on occasion, to spend time at home with their loved ones rather than constantly working at the soup kitchen, because doing those things maximize the Utiliarian's ability to continue to do good over the long run. This would change my point slightly, but I suppose you could alter my second-to-last paragraph to be about your own *energy* rather than happiness per se. No matter how much you love your kids, you eventually need to go to sleep. No matter how much good working at free clinic puts out into the world, eventually you'll become exhausted in both body and mind and will need to watch some old episodes of a beloved cartoon show as you wind down. Doing those things properly will help keep you sharp and able to keep on keepin' on, as the kids say.<johixxx>: Do I understand your statement correct, that doing something because you enjoy it rather than because you feel obliged to is not morally? From my point of view the best you can do what you enjoy most and act according morally. If for instance someone enjoys cooking, he could only cook at home for himself, but you can also cook in a soup kitchen. I don't think ethics are to limit us but instead to guide us and give us sense on where we should head to work as best as possible for the greater good. I don't think the second scenario is economically in creating as much good as possible. I feel you both agree, that you need to spend energy to create something. If it is using up your own happiness or money or energy per se, to create happiness or a better world or anything else does not really matter from my point of view. And I feel I agree slightly more with u/BlaineTog, that the aim is to keep enough (energy, money, happiness) to yourself to allow you to give more in the long run. One point I would like to add in this discussion is that the article discusses being 100% morally and doing things that are neither moral nor non-moral. I would like to hear your points of view on that, but I feel that doing something that does not concern morality does not effect you being 100% moral? So, while you could argue, that spending extra time with one of my friends is immoral because I could spend the time on charity work, I could also argue, that this time might help my friend more than I might have otherwise. Since both statements are very hypothetical I don't feel one is more valid compared to the other and due to that it does not affect me living my life 100% morally. However wasting your time on purpose by taking more time for yourself than you need or something similar I guess I could consider as immoral. TL;DR: Morality from my point of view is doing the things you enjoy in a responsible way (e.g. hiking and taking trash to the next bin, if you see some). Inputs wanted on the topic, if doing something arguably neither moral nor immoral affects your status of living 100% moral. By someone interested in the hypotheses rather than living his life this way.<BlaineTog>: &gt; Do I understand your statement correct, that doing something because you enjoy it rather than because you feel obliged to is not morally? From my point of view the best you can do what you enjoy most and act according morally. If for instance someone enjoys cooking, he could only cook at home for himself, but you can also cook in a soup kitchen. I don't think ethics are to limit us but instead to guide us and give us sense on where we should head to work as best as possible for the greater good. I don't think the second scenario is economically in creating as much good as possible. You missed a word: \"interesting.\" Doing good things because you like to do them isn't morally interesting. That is, when there is no conflict between your wants and your obligations, we don't have any difficult ethical questions to answer. You don't need a moral philosopher to give you suggestions on how to live in that circumstance. &gt; One point I would like to add in this discussion is that the article discusses being 100% morally and doing things that are neither moral nor non-moral. I would like to hear your points of view on that, but I feel that doing something that does not concern morality does not effect you being 100% moral? My position is that the article is absurd, and this point shows why. It's trying to box Utilitarianism and Kantianism into a corner by blatantly ignoring the limitations of being human. We are not machines able to output constant good. That's simply not possible, and to demand the impossible is absurd. The good Utilitarian attempts to find the proper inflection point between self care and putting good out into the world.<johixxx>: &gt; That is, when there is no conflict between your wants and your obligations, we don't have any difficult ethical questions to answer. Is this conflict necessary? Assuming different people enjoy different stuff, isn't it possible to do good without acting against your wants? E.g. someone who likes hiking can do that and clean trash while he is at it, I on the other hand might prefer going swimming and due to that could protest for cleaning the oceans. I feel like the main issue is mostly laziness and I am not sure whether moral obligation is able to fix this. &gt; We are not machines able to output constant good. That's simply not possible, and to demand the impossible is absurd. While I agree wholeheartedly with that statement, I still feel the article is relevant to some extends because people often think in extrems. And that is not without reason, it simplifies the world. By assuming the world is black and white it simplifies a discussion on the basic idea. However, it should be pointed out in the article, which I felt was not done to the necessary extent and of course it is only able to carry an idea. The application of which in the real world has to be differentiated and is a lot more difficult. Again, I think similar like you, that it is missing the point by bypassing reality. But I see, why you would communicate it in such a way as it allows the concept to be grasped by a wide majority of the readers. And as we know, it is foolish to take something from the internet without any doubt or thought about it. Thanks for elaborating on why you feel, the article is absurd, I feel I am now able to understand you a bit better. :)", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 296.5714285714}

Also, why would the teaching be the joke? The joke is the joke. You could say about any joke: \"practicing that alone on one's room isn't that funny\". And you'd be correct. Jimmy has some pretty well constructed jokes with what could be called offensive content. Obviously he shouldn't be unduly censored. But just because someone hasn't hosted a panel show, does that mean their speech shouldn't be protected? It's just a bit misleading to broadly state that the UK decided not censor comedy, when those protections are neither broadly nor equally applied. If the permissability of a joke is determined by the censor's humor, it makes it quite difficult to joke about those in power. <paulusmagintie>: Goose stepping and doing a mock sneeze and saying oh look up there to do a nazi salute is different to teaching others to do it, like teaching dogs to pray.

That would take a certain degree of self-awareness that some people just don\u2019t have, so while you could encourage free thought, it\u2019s not something you can necessarily force, and you might still end up with polarized viewpoints, as the headline of the article points out.<PoppinJ>: &gt; What is fallacious about it That you believe the positive, negative, and neutral actions in particles are in any way the same as judgmental labeling of positive, negative, and neutral behaviors and viewpoints, or can be compared at all. The words \"positive, negative, and neutral\" mean completely different things in the two situations. &gt;Is that a point that the article is making, or something you\u2019re personally wondering? It's me. &gt;I guess it can be or it cannot be. I\u2019m not sure why this would matter. I'm trying to glean what you mean when you say \"polarization is natural\". Are you saying it's good or bad? Is it good or bad **because** it's natural. If it's natural, does that mean it's necessary? Is it unnecessary? It matters in terms of understanding what you meant. And it matters if it is helpful in us solving our problems with each other. &gt;&gt;Should it not be overcome? &gt;it\u2019s not something you can necessarily force I wasn't meaning to suggest that. I meant would it be helpful to overcome? Or is it good that we do it, and we shouldn't try and change it? I was just trying to get to what you mean by \"polarization is natural\". Some natural things are not good and we'd benefit if we didn't do them.<TheBookOfSeil>: &gt; That you believe the positive, negative, and neutral actions in particles are in any way the same as judgmental labeling of positive, negative, and neutral behaviors and viewpoints, or can be compared at all. No, that is not what I meant by it. It isn\u2019t as specific as that. It was more of a surface level analogy depicting how thing exist on a spectrum or a continuum. On one side you would have a positive, and the other side you would have a negative, while neutral would be in the middle. Likewise, with conceptual human thoughts, you\u2019d have, say liberal on one side, conservative on the other, and some equal combination of the two in the middle. Physiologically, we have male on one side, female on the other side, and what we would call \u201cintersex\u201d in the middle. While there are other sides and degrees that things could exist as (because the fabric of reality is intertwined), the analogy was limited to displaying the opposite nature of things, so discovering that humans would be polarized to sides of an argument or viewpoint should be no surprise. &gt; I'm trying to glean what you mean when you say \"polarization is natural\". Are you saying it's good or bad? No. &gt; Is it good or bad because it's natural. No. &gt; If it's natural, does that mean it's necessary? Maybe. That\u2019s not something I can exactly answer. Would be more a more appropriate question for a god, if one exists. &gt; I wasn't meaning to suggest that. I meant would it be helpful to overcome? Or is it good that we do it, and we shouldn't try and change it? It could, or it could not be. That\u2019s not something that we can know until after it happens. We can think it is good, and strive for it to be realized, but we cannot know the exact outcome until it has become part of the present. &gt; I was just trying to get to what you mean by \"polarization is natural\". Some natural things are not good and we'd benefit if we didn't do them. I\u2019m not so sure. I\u2019d like to say that everything exists for a reason, even an unknown or unforeseeable reason, and we cannot simply discard it because we think it is unnecessary. Some things exist or happen because of a decision or event that caused it to happen, and arguing about whether it is a good thing or a bad thing is irrelevant to the event happening, or a thing being created. It just exists because it exists, or happened because it happened, and that is all that can really be said about it.<PoppinJ>: &gt;It just exists because it exists, or happened because it happened, and that is all that can really be said about it. I'm not sure how one can maintain that attitude in the face of certain events. Child molestation exists because it exists, or happens because it happens, and that is all that can really be said about it. Really? That's all you can say about it? &gt;arguing about whether it is a good thing or a bad thing is irrelevant to the event happening Sure, if you simply want to look at the event in vacuum. But that isn't how life functions, and the repercussions of actions are relevant to how life functions. I'm not sure how you can claim that about atrocities that people commit. \"It happened, that's all you can say about it, and discussing whether it's good or bad is irrelevant\". Wow. <TheBookOfSeil>: &gt; I'm not sure how one can maintain that attitude in the face of certain events. Child molestation exists because it exists, or happens because it happens, and that is all that can really be said about it. Really? That's all you can say about it? Ah now you\u2019re getting into the realm of human emotion and perception, which of course is going to have connotations and pretenses applied to words, thoughts and actions. I\u2019m not sure if every aspect of our opinions can be applied to the whole of reality, as I\u2019ve said already, because doing so will have some meaning to us but that is the only meaning there would be, which ultimately amounts to nothing. From the perspective of nature, child molestation doesn\u2019t exist. It is a series of concepts entirely constructed by humans, and each element is basically a pretense set up in order to construct rules for living in a manner aside from from nature and natural law, which we call \u201cmodern civilization.\u201d That being said, we could say more about that subject, of course. We could say as much as we wanted to. None of it would be any indication of actual truth on the matter, though. &gt; Sure, if you simply want to look at the event in vacuum. Technically, the event is happening in a vacuum, because space is a vacuum... &gt; But that isn't how life functions, and the repercussions of actions are relevant to how life functions. In what way? &gt; I'm not sure how you can claim that about atrocities that people commit. Either way, what happens simply happens. Applying emotion to the event does not change the objectivity of the event occurring, so what is speaking about it going to do? You can\u2019t reverse time after what happened with your emotions or opinions about the event, so the emotion is meaningless after the fact.<PoppinJ>: It sounds like you're talking to someone who just sits around and complains about things that happened. You're right, there is no going back in time and changing things. But that is so obvious and a useless thing to say. But there is the concept of learning from what happened and gaining foresight. \"What happens simply happens\" has zero informative power...and it's erroneous. You hand wave away emotional responses, but they are \"what happens\", too. And they help inform us as to how to move forward. &gt;Technically, the event is happening in a vacuum, because space is a vacuum... This is such a bullshit answer. And completely irrelevant. &gt;each element is basically a pretense set up in order to construct rules for living in a manner aside from from nature and natural law Oh, man. So, what and how we think is not part of nature? Somehow that process took place, takes place, outside of nature? Our emotional development is a pretense? Our development as social animals takes place \"aside from nature\"? How so? How is not every aspect of humans not a product of nature? &gt;From the perspective of nature Nature doesn't have a perspective. \"Nature\" is just another one of those \"pretenses\" that \"ultimately amounts to nothing\" concepts. If you believe anything you're saying you wouldn't even talk to anybody. Because you're just mucking about in the same \"amounts to nothing\" that everybody else is mucking about in. Everything you say is just a \"pretense\". &gt;child molestation doesn\u2019t exist. It is a series of concepts entirely constructed by humans Ummm, no. There is an action that takes place, you can watch it. How we perceive it and react to it provides the meaning we apply to it. Since we are intellectual AND emotional beings, this meaning we apply is pertinent and valid. Since we are part of nature, then our intellect, emotions, as well as the meaning we apply is all naturally occurring phenomena. &gt;because doing so will have some meaning to us but that is the only meaning there would be, which ultimately amounts to nothing Except that you find meaning that amounts to all sorts of things for you and everyone you engage. Every day, all the time. You strive for the things this meaning shows you, which amounts to most of your life. I think you need to take a few more decades to contemplate these things you're espousing. Because you're making erroneous statements, contradicting yourself, and providing nothing useful. <TheBookOfSeil>: &gt;\"What happens simply happens\" has zero informative power... It is not meant to have \"informative power,\" unless you use it to develop a different way of viewing the world. &gt;and it's erroneous. You hand wave away emotional responses, but they are \"what happens\", too. Yes. They are a reaction to a reaction. They are also equally as meaningless as two rocks colliding in space. &gt;And they help inform us as to how to move forward. For what? Maybe as being applicable to our own lives, but if everyone's emotional responses and subsequent reactions to those emotions are justified simply because they have them, doesn't that basically reiterate what I said about \"what happens, just happens?\" If not, are some emotions \"more valid\" than others? We can't handwave those away but we can handwave away the ones that are \"wrong\" by unanimous decision? That doesn't sound consistent to me. &gt;This is such a bullshit answer. And completely irrelevant. It was kind of a joke, but alright. &gt;So, what and how we think is not part of nature? It is, in a way. I don't think it is \"in line\" or \"in conjunction\" with nature, though, which is why I said that we form pretenses. Just to be clear, one of the definitions of a pretense is \"an attempt to make something that is not the case appear true.\" For example, \"child molestation.\" You say in a later comment that it \"is an action that takes place, you can watch it. How we perceive it and react to it provides the meaning we apply to it.\" However, if you are never taught that \"child molestation\" is \"child molestation,\" you wouldn't perceive it as being the same way it was taught to you. Therefore, the phrase has connotations and pretenses that cause you to think or react to it in a different way than you \"naturally\" would. Does that make sense now? &gt;Our development as social animals takes place \"aside from nature\"? Yes, and no. Like I just said, there's an element or aspect of nature which we act in or with, but there is also an element or aspect aside from nature that we act in or with. I suppose it would depend on whether you think everything that exists, can exist, or will exist, is \"part of nature\" or if things can exist apart from \"nature.\" &gt;Nature doesn't have a perspective. \"Nature\" is just another one of those \"pretenses\" that \"ultimately amounts to nothing\" concepts. Can you explain what you mean by this? &gt; If you believe anything you're saying you wouldn't even talk to anybody. Not necessarily. It means that I recognize that it doesn't matter much whether or not I talk to anyone, so I can choose to do so, or choose not to. &gt;Because you're just mucking about in the same \"amounts to nothing\" that everybody else is mucking about in. Everything you say is just a \"pretense\". How so? &gt; Since we are intellectual AND emotional beings, this meaning we apply is pertinent and valid. Since we are part of nature, then our intellect, emotions, as well as the meaning we apply is all naturally occurring phenomena. I think this applies to an earlier question, so I'll just wait to see how you answer that one. &gt;Except that you find meaning that amounts to all sorts of things for you and everyone you engage. Every day, all the time. You strive for the things this meaning shows you, which amounts to most of your life. Right. And then you (and they) cease to exist. What happened in the span of your life is only relevant and meaningful to you, and the span at which it happened in. Outside of that, it is meaningless, because there is nothing else in existence that carries out that meaning (unless \"god\"). &gt;I think you need to take a few more decades to contemplate these things you're espousing. Because you're making erroneous statements, contradicting yourself, and providing nothing useful. I am sorry that it is not useful to you then. <PoppinJ>: I had a long reply written out, but I decided to address just one thing which I think is central to our disagreements. &gt;What happened in the span of your life is only relevant and meaningful to you, and the span at which it happened in This is entirely erroneous. What happened in the span of my life included thousands of other beings. I did not live my life in a bubble. It's an ongoing interaction with others. The overlap from before I was born to after I die defies this assertion of yours. And our experiences are an ongoing interlapping. &gt;Outside of that, it is meaningless What is outside of life and existence? Who cares if there is no meaning where nothing exists? That's not where we experience life so why should we consider it at all? &gt;because there is nothing else in existence that carries out that meaning That has zero impact on the meaning that one perceives, and zero impact on the validity of that meaning. We don't need to live forever for our experiences to have meaning.", "num_messages": 11, "avg_score": 19.0909090909}

Although a beautifully written sentence, can the universe have a perspective? &gt; this object What object are you referring to? <NorthDakotaExists>: It's just thinking of the universe as a sort of shape or object in a mathematical space like a tesseract or a hypersphere, and the projection of this object into 3D space for a defined time. What I'm saying here in regards to \"the universe's perspective\" means looking at the object for what it is in 4D space instead of taking 3D slices of it at defined moments in time, which something we are unfortunately incapable of doing even in abstract. <gonzoparenting>: Ok, I think I get the theory, but how does this relate to the idea that the Universe has a 'divine watchmaker', ie: some kind of consciousness that creates and/or controls the Universe. Are you suggesting that the Universe itself (as described by you) is itself the creator of itself? Side note: Not sure if this was what you intended, but I noticed that if you substitute 'God' for 'Universe' in your first paragraph, \"The universe is a higher-dimensional object that is outside the constraints of its own time. From the perspective of the universe, the past and future all exist simultaneously in a unified eternal moment\", it comes close to the description many have given for what God is. <NorthDakotaExists>: It means that the universe is determinant in nature at some level and might give hints as to what future forms might emerge just as the protrusion of an omega point ion the surface of water indicates the emergence of something beneath. In a sense the universe created or \"creates\" itself, but creation is temporal, implying there was a time it didn't exist and a time it did. However, if you consider time another spatial dimension, asking when the was the universe created is akin to asking \"where does a sphere begin\". That question doesn't make sense in the context of the dimensionality of a sphere. You could think of my analogy as 'God', but I personally don't see it as being a \"being\". <Edit>: Now that I think about, this idea more closely related to the 'Dao' in Daoism than a 'God'. It's not a being or even a governing force; it's just an observation of how things in nature tend to unfold, and how that is an intrinsic property of reality.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 2.1666666667}

PLease give any tips<JLotts>: Descarte saw a history of stoics that followes Socratic questions. He emphasized the question of certainty. Sideline to Descartes were other theories, with Hobbes' Social Contract and Leibnizian metaphysics. From Descartes' question and quest for basic certainty, empiricists started to developing their position with John Locke (but he was too haphazard and disjunct). Empiricism mainly held the view of the idea that we should work only with phenomenon we know, while avoiding assertions about grand, unifying theories. You should be able to recognize this as a response to Descartes. In the mix was the French Revolution's philosophers, Rosseau and Voltaire. Voltaire basically opposed people of certain knowledge, like a philosophical critic. Rosseau invented the idea of 'group-will' or 'group thinking' Many still tried for unified theories despite Voltaire, and continued like Rosseau to get at the nature of mind. A string of these philosophers were known as sensationalists, who were in search of a unified theory about the nature of mind and they thought to consider the nature of our physical senses as a base understanding. This is the string that lead to Kant who went beyond consideration of senses to say that they are an a priori mess that we dont need to get at if we can discover how they consolidate as knowledge. Between Kant and a couple other major philosophers, a process of how abstraction becomes knowledge, was articulated. Kant wanted to create a terminology for this process. He used the word, 'trascendence', to describe how the mess transcends into objective knowledge. Once again, there was a new reaction of Aesthetic Philosphers that sought to explain the a priori. Their hunch was that Beauty was the object which drives the mess of a priori perception. This turned into a great deal of debate about the essence of beaty and art. Hegel was one of the front-runners, and he described a natural force for ideas and things to generally flow from subjectivity towards objectivity to then xombine as some absolute spirit. Meanwhile, empiricists were getting onto the prevalence of 'usefulness', suggesting that things are dominant forces because they are useful. More reactions came. Analytic philosophy was born in response to Hegel, which basically aimed to nail down terminology for all phenomenons being described by the diverse selection of philosophers. But more came to further unify a theory of Being, thus inventing Existentialists like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. The more skeptical bands of skepticism produced Process philosophy, born of empiricism. They said that it was not usefulness that solely dictates the evolution of things, rather that the process of transition was itself a force constraining how things go, and that this process was difficult to really predict. Into today, we have Psychology, Existentialism, and post-modernism competing. Post-modernism is the new skepticism. Strings of Plato is on the rise: there is a growing number of virtue theorists reinventing the unified-theory model. Physcology os the empirical model. And Analytic Philosophe is like a meta-empiricism. I did not include Wittgenstein and linguistics in the history of philosophy, but the field is somewhat like empirical existentialism who is skeptical of everything except the phenomena of the 'word'. Anyone that wants to stipulate or criticize my quick history of philosophy, PLEASE DO SO. I just hope i prompt enough stipulation to help hadd clarity go myself and the original commentor.<lapse_of_taste>: Sorry, but basically everything you wrote is either false or highly misleading. I'm not going to give you a line-for-line critique, but it should be obvious that summing up centuries of thought with a single sentence is a bad idea. You get basic concepts like transcendental arguments or the general will wrong. Some of what you said doesn't even make sense. I'm giving you a few examples of this, but I can only recommend that you read a textbook. &gt;More reactions came. Analytic philosophy was born in response to Hegel That's false. Early Analytics responded to British Idealism, maybe that's what you meant? &gt; The more skeptical bands of skepticism produced Process philosophy, born of empiricism. Process philosophy has arguably been around since Heraclitus and it's not the creation of super-skeptical sceptics. &gt;Into today, we have Psychology, Existentialism, and post-modernism competing. Huh? Psychology is not a philosophical movement, existentialism is over and so is post-modernism (at least if you're talking about the thinkers usually associated with it, but the term itself is incredibly controversial and not a chosen label). &gt; Strings of Plato is on the rise: there is a growing number of virtue theorists reinventing the unified-theory model. What's the unified-theory model? And virtue ethicists usually base their work on Aristotle? &gt; And Analytic Philosophe is like a meta-empiricism. What's that supposed to mean?<JLotts>: https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/analytic-philosophy-and-the-return-of ...'Analytic Philosophy as response to Hegelian thought'. Plato.stanford.edu reports the same relation between Hegel and Analytic Philosophy. British Idealism became more popularized as it adopted some of Hegel's language. Inspired by Hegelian language, British Idealism resounded itself (though the movement was quite diverse, and too complex to be generally described). It is easier to understand British Idealism as 'outlined' or grounded by the Hegelian Dialectic. So you and I both are correct. Analytic philosophy was a reaction to wild generalizations that werent entirely concrete or coherent with respect to other philosophical inquiries. The analytic approach, then, was to precisely name every relevant phenomenon in a concrete way: it is a construction of terminology rather than a construction of some set of major theories And existentialism is by no means done. Jordan Peterson uses the notion of Meaning commonly while reporting on Piaget's model of existence. JP suggests a mythological or arcetypal element is strongly at play in the mind, though the construction of Meaning is not fully understood. He uses the word 'proclivity' often, or 'tendency', rather than suggesting a certain nature of being. And if psychology is not a philosophical field, it still serves to better grasp the nature of being; i find it stubborn to refuse psychology's philosophical nature, while desperately trying to claim science as its true classification. Though i do admit the psychology is the most scientific surface of knowledge of the mind, so i feel your sentiment. When someone claims everything i say to be false or misleading, they ought to be more accommodating.<lapse_of_taste>: &gt;...'Analytic Philosophy as response to Hegelian thought'. That's not the same as Hegel - but in retrospect, I shouldn't have said that it was plainly false. The reason why I think it's misleading is because it presents the divide as occuring much earlier than it actually happened. It skips over the complex relationship of Husserl and Heidegger with early Analytic thought. &gt;And existentialism is by no means done. Jordan Peterson uses the notion of Meaning commonly while reporting on Piaget's model of existence. JP suggests a mythological or arcetypal element is strongly at play in the mind, though the construction of Meaning is not fully understood. He uses the word 'proclivity' often, or 'tendency', rather than suggesting a certain nature of being. Peterson is not a philosopher and he's not taken seriously by academic philosophers. &gt;And if psychology is not a philosophical field, it still serves to better grasp the nature of being; i find it stubborn to refuse psychology's philosophical nature, while desperately trying to claim science as its true classification. \"Grasping the nature of being\"? That's extremely vague if you mean it in a broad enough way to encompass psychology. I'm not sure how psychology has a more philosophical nature than, say, sociology or cognitive science.<JLotts>: Philosophy, Psychology, cognitive science, and social science, all deal with how the brain, mind, representational perceptions, and the world fit together. Philosophy includes not only this study, but also study of ethics, politics, and aesthetics too, so it is the overall field of inquiry. Science reduces philosphical inquiries into hypothesis and empirical results, but still includes the philosophical judgments being made about the evidence. But this is a side issue, let us drop it. As with JP; my point was that existentialism did not finish. You are right that my summary overlooks a lot of the complex development. My aim was to give the original commenter some vague scope to familiarize terminology and relate various philosophers he might study. This is at a cost, but his scope of Descartes to Kant will edit itself as he goes. I think the scope i gave is better than no scope. However, you protest that i passed over without mention the dynamic between Husserl and Hegel. I have too vague of memory of that interplay. Would you mind offering a synopsis. P.S. Kant and Fichte (and Jacobi i guess?) together make up my favorite interplay, in the articulations of Understanding, Abstraction, and Reason.<lapse_of_taste>: &gt; As with JP; my point was that existentialism did not finish. Yeah, but that's basically like taking some Youtube celebrity with no formal training in philosophy who frequently talks about Stoicism as evidence for the claim that Stoicism is one of the main contemporary schools of thought in philosophy. &gt;You are right that my summary overlooks a lot of the complex development. My aim was to give the original commenter some vague scope to familiarize terminology and relate various philosophers he might study. This is at a cost, but his scope of Descartes to Kant will edit itself as he goes. I think the scope i gave is better than no scope. I think that generally speaking, not giving a summary of centuries of thought is better than giving a misleading summary. Frankly, it looks like you've got your education in history of philosophy from the Crash Course series on Youtube (which is frequently horrible). If you care for recommendations, Coplestons books about the history of philosophy (books IV-VI for early modern thought) are great, or if you're into podcasts, *History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps* is awesome, though it does not yet cover modern philosophy. &gt; However, you protest that i passed over without mention the dynamic between Husserl and Hegel. I have too vague of memory of that interplay. Would you mind offering a synopsis. I wasn't talking about Husserl and Hegel, but rather Husserl and Heidegger (i. e. key players in phenomenology) and their relationship to early Analytic philosophy. Michael Friedman's *A Parting of the Ways* is a great case study about Heidegger and Carnap specifically.<JLotts>: My training came from 2 years of reading through summaries of 50 philosophers written by writers of plato.stanford.edu. It was a sloppy training for sure. You criticize without grounded criticism. When you tried, you were flat out wrong. JP studied at least Jung and Piaget and practiced psychology for over a decade, and now teaches about personality and various models of the mind. If you dont consider JP a philosopher, then you're a fool. You directly criticized me for suggesting Hegel's influence on Analytic Philosophy, when multiple sources directly adress that. You'd be wise to practice praising those you seem to criticize. There's a chance that you're not grasping the bigger picture of how ideas moved throught the last 2000 years of history. So prove me wrong by showing your prowess, and help elucidate for the original commentor the history of philosophy from Descartes to Kant.<lapse_of_taste>: &gt;You criticize without grounded criticism. When you tried, you were flat out wrong. Where? Most of what you said is barely coherent enough to critizise. What's the unified-theory-model, for example? &gt; JP studied at least Jung and Piaget and practiced psychology for over a decade, and now teaches about personality and various models of the mind. If you dont consider JP a philosopher, then you're a fool. That makes him a *psychologist*, not a philosopher. He hasn't published anything in a philosophy journal, and he hasn't written a book considered to be philosophy by his hypothetical peers. He's not a philosopher. Psychology is not philosophy. &gt; You directly criticized me for suggesting Hegel's influence on Analytic Philosophy, when multiple sources directly adress that. Again, saying that Analytic philosophy was born in response to Hegel makes it seem as if Analytic philosophy has been around decades earlier than it actually has, which is misleading. I've already said that I shouldn't have claimed that it's plainly false. &gt;So prove me wrong by showing your prowess, and help elucidate for the original commentor the history of philosophy from Descartes to Kant. Again, I don't think it's fruitful to sum up centuries of thinkers that way.<JLotts>: I think we should stick to one argument at a time. You seem interested in truth enough to be agreeable eventually, so lets ckean up some of the past arguments. JP studied philosophy and psychology but he produced no philosophical text. So i ask you: should we consider a man to not be a philosopher if he knows the history of philosophy but does not write a paper? Have you written a philosophical paper? At this point, i would stand on trial claiming that you are a philospher. So what is your answer?<lapse_of_taste>: &gt; So i ask you: should we consider a man to not be a philosopher if he knows the history of philosophy but does not write a paper? There's a difference between knowing about an academic field and working in it. The fact that someone knows a lot about history does not make her a historian. If she had a PhD in history, was teaching it at certain institutions or was actually publishing about history, then we should consider her to be one. On a side note, Peterson often gets the philosophers he's talking about very, very wrong. I suggest not trusting him on issues unrelated to psychology, his actual academic field. &gt; Have you written a philosophical paper? Of course, but I'm not a philosopher.<JLotts>: Well. Do you consider piaget and jung to phsycholigists and not philosophers? They both innovated models of the nature of mind. Do not models of the nature if mind constitute a major branch if philosophy? JP teaches of Piagetian and Jungian models of the nature of mind. If you dont consider the two of them philosophers, then i can reluctantly concede, that JP is not a philosopher because he only taught of psychologists and therefore would only be a psychologist. I dont agree this argument, but at least your defense of the distinction between psychology and philosophy, would be stated. And so we could move on to the next point.<lapse_of_taste>: &gt;Well. Do you consider piaget and jung to phsycholigists and not philosophers? I'm not familiar enough with Piaget, but from my estimation, they're not philosophers. Maybe their work has philosophical relevance - but so does the theory of evolution, and that is biology rather than philosophy. &gt; They both innovated models of the nature of mind. Do not models of the nature if mind constitute a major branch if philosophy? Empirical works on the nature of the mind are not philosophy, although they can be of interest to philosophers. Just like how macroeconomics can be of interest to political scientists, but it's not part of the field. And again, when Peterson talks about philosophers like Heidegger, he proves to lack any in-depth understanding.<JLotts>: 'Of interest' is a really slight way to put it, seeing how nearly every philosopher renowned in history their opinions on mind. Isnt that field called 'philosophy of mind'? Anyway, im starting to see your dispute. Why dont you just describe your definition of a philosopher.<lapse_of_taste>: People who provide contributions to the discipline of philosophy by writing books/journal articles recognized as original by their peers, people who are employed in the field or something related (i.e. teaching at university or being a consultant with the necessary expertise on an ethics board), arguably people with PhDs or in it...<JLotts>: I disagree totally man. You're describing profession philosophers. I can be an ameteur chess player but im not a professional chess player until i make money from the game. You and i are ameteur philisophers. We deal with philosophy. JP has dealt with philosophy more than you and I. Why would you rob so many people of their experience with philosophy? Do you see my point? What should we call people who work with philosophy but are not established enough to historically recognized philosophers?<lapse_of_taste>: &gt;I disagree totally man. You're describing profession philosophers. I can be an ameteur chess player but im not a professional chess player until i make money from the game. You and i are ameteur philisophers. We deal with philosophy. I know how to treat a wound and when the battle of Waterloo happened, but I wouldn't call myself a doctor or a historian either. You should note that the only reason why we're talking about Peterson in the first place is because you talked about existentialism as if it's one of the three main contemporary movements in philosophy, which was in the context of your description of the history of the discipline - notably, you were not talking about amateur philosophers there. If you want to call him an amateur philosopher, fine by me; but then you have to call Stoicism a main contemporary movement as well just because some kids on Youtube are talking about it. You see my point? &gt; JP has dealt with philosophy more than you and I. I seriously doubt that. And if he has, he fails to be good at it. Again, he is not good when it comes to talking about actual philosophers. He appears to get most of his knowledge about the \"postmoderns\" from an *Randian* of all people. &gt; Why would you rob so many people of their experience with philosophy? I'm not robbing anybody of that. &gt; Do you see my point? What should we call people who work with philosophy but are not established enough to historically recognized philosophers? Amateurs is fine, but again: In the context where you brought him up, *you were talking about an academic discipline*. <JLotts>: I have my discrepencies with what you say, but i see your point. Lets move on. I mentioned a unified-theory-model. Let me get into that. Hegel, Heidegger, Husserl, T.H. Green, and many other 'philosophers' believed they had a single model that is possibly the best model for understanding the nature of mind. Husserl, for example, believed that the mode of consciousness should be characterized as being of intention. He believed that an underlying drive of intentionality is bracketed by being like some governing position, while all else is set aside. Kants ideas somewhat resemble this idea, bracketing out 'a priori' phenomena to stabilize some transcendent understanding which is a base for abstraction and reasoning (kant and fichte came to this agreed upon model through some back-and-forth convervasation). By 'unified-theory-model', i meant to name the belief that the nature of mind could be understood through some singular model. In opposition, there has always been a philosophical skepticism about the existence of any best singular model of consciousness. Emerson specifically emphasized change and viscinitudes which were essentially contextual (though he did offer his best guess at the nature of mind in his essay, 'Nature'). Leibniz would say that existence is monadical, and is varied rather than singular. Socrates searched for a single set of virtues, but never found anyone who could describe such. It appears to me that the history of philosophy can be understood by the attempt to find a model for the nature of mind. Various camps were developed as an opinion leaning towards one model or another, in response to previous models, whereas skeptical camps tended towards the need for empirical evidence rather than some fallible model. Do you see similar trends in the history of philosophy?", "num_messages": 19, "avg_score": 1.6842105263}

The moral weight of the example fails once you reject the artificial equivalency between the two issues.

The men that committed the attack in all likelihood saw charlie hebdo as a means to an end. If charlie hebdo had not existed how probable would it be that those men would have altered their life path and decided to leave peaceful lives? Will the historical forces that gave them lives that they thought were worthy of throwing away suddenly shift if we increase censorship (whether via silence or forcefully)?

Let me rephrase it in a bit more of a serious tone starting from the beginning. I disagree with the notion that there is nothing irrational about punishing a crime. It's rational in the sense that it resembles a X causes Y proposition. Its the same kind of rationality that you saw in the heavens gate mass suicide. On this occasion 39 heavens gate followers participated in a mass suicide in order to reach what they believed was an extraterrestrial spacecraft following Comet Hale-Bopp. While there is no doubt that it might make sense to kill yourself if you believe paradise awaits actually doing so might not be what the average person would call rational. A rational actor acting on flawed premises does not produce rational actions. That being said you were right I was/am rambling sorry about that.<HormelCoffee>: After reading the first sentence here, and your previous two troll-posts, I didn't bother wasting my time reading the rest since it's obvious you're just interested in fighting/trolling and not having a conversation and I have better things to be doing Try again without all the snark that adds nothing to your point<Rabbit-Punch>: Horm really hit this one home.", "num_messages": 12, "avg_score": 8.0}

To clarify, why should I accept anyone else\u2019s moral code and should I even my own; does morality even exist? If morality does exist objectively what birthed morality? If morality is subjective how can somebody say anyone else\u2019s moral code is wrong? If morality is purely evolutionary, then wouldn\u2019t anything that keeps a person alive be morally acceptable? <Edit>: Sorry for all the questions in a single comment.<bohrmachine>: I liked JLotts response. It\u2019s not purely evolutionary. It\u2019s both evolutionary and inherent. It is in some way our will to escape suffering, and our will for meaningful connections, etc. We are becoming more complicated, and so morality becomes more complicated to sustain. When our lifestyle cannot sustain a good moral standard there are consequences, and some of us can\u2019t see those consequences for what they are, especially if they are removed from suffering them. Some people may not realize that they are actively suffering their own moral failings. Widespread conflict is a sign of moral failing in society. Morality is not about rules or guidelines as much as it is about caring deeply about life, living things, and the highest standards of collective life experience. Some consistent moral elements can be found in how you care about yourself, even if you only care about yourself.<JLotts>: I like your observation about moral failure on conflict en masse. This seems to parallel what i was saying about hypocracy. Perhaps we can define morality as systemic agreement. Perhaps a crude etymologist could suggest morality as being 'more of all, organized like a city'. Coherency, Continuity, Contingency, all touch upon a systemic agreement or order. In this general interpretation, morality looks like the commonly mentioned ethic of unity. Instincts, thought, emotion, and selfhood seem to be four elemental pillars of unity. This four-pillar model of unity may be wrong, but if i feel lost from the model, i can always identify a loss of general unity. Whereas, moral actions always bring me a sense of unity. Ethics is cool.<bohrmachine>: Ethics are the hero in us all! One of the things that I spend a lot if time thinking about is the establishment of moral order. I think moral miseducation is an epidemic. The idea of Unity itself is being poisoned, corrupted, and weaponized. That somehow unity is all important, but cannot be achieved or applied in totality. Contradictions and shortsightedness. I think ethics and morality are often misunderstood and subsequently rejected. They are something that should sell itself, but it seems to have an active smear campaign. Some of it may be due to the rejection of religious doctrine that might have hugely substituted for morality in some circles. Some might think morality is arbitrary, when many of the most important aspects are common &amp; fundamental. I intend to continuously fight towards pushing articulate moral responsibility into the collective consciousness.<JLotts>: Good man. I dont deny political propaganda and a smear campaign, but its important to also realize that the totality of morality is utterly complex, so narrow appeals to morality thrive. Though the ethic of unity is a bit arbitraty, i have skilled the recognition of disunity to more quickly mitigate and escape those more unhealthy modes of thought. In other words, we dont have to identify the quality of complex unity to attain it. Instead we can limit the more simple narrows of perception. This includes conquering over hate with love; conquering over one idea with many, and cultivating narrow, addictive skills with diverse exploration and experimentation,--we can approach all by demanding more. I do think education and cirriculum is a major point of concern for future generations. The question for me is: what sort of cirriculum should be constructed?<bohrmachine>: I think you\u2019re onto something, and luckily wanting/demanding more is reliably human. Technology should continue to open up channels for our many voices and interests. Some of the things I think should be taught in school more seriously (as a public standard) are a more honest assessment of history and contemporary issues (with an emphasis on responsibility, and suffering as a consequence of bad systems/decisions), some psychology to give young people the ability to see themselves and each other more clearly, and ethics to start asking important questions based on this knowledge.<JLotts>: Let me detail your suggestions with my additions 1. history and human politics ...history of tribes and civil-states ...history of science ...economics, and history of trade and technology ...actual science (math, chemistry, physics, biology, electronics and programming, complex systems) ...history of art and culture ...utopia and modern technology 2.

Let me know if other topics should be added to the list.<bohrmachine>: I would add the philosophy of human rights, and studies on interconnectivity &amp; interdependence.

But, the Christian worldview does not say: \u201cBecause it is in the Bible, therefore it is true, (or right or good).\u201d Scripture assumes a set of core truths. But without positing an ontic (objective) referent, how will you base morality? And how will you escape relativism, which is absolutely necessary for morality? The atheist and theist largely agree that good is good and bad is bad, but the difference is: the theist has an objective base on which to build, and the atheist must build, basically, floating without a foundation. I\u2019m not saying atheists can\u2019t reason morally. They absolutely can, it\u2019s human.<DMinyaDMs>: How is God an objective base if it can't be proven to exist? Especially considering how many Gods there are and have been, which God has the most authority on morality? All of them? Yours? If anything religion is even less objective since it relies on primarily dogma rather than reason and evidence. Unless you're saying starting with any standard at all is inherently objective by virtue of being a srandard.<Le_Dudz>: He isn\u2019t arguing if God exists or not, he is saying if in the possibility of God existing, then his moral objectivity will supersede any other subjective morality that a human can put forth, simply because God knows what\u2019s better for us whether it\u2019s in the short term or long term because of his nature as God (creator all knowing all seeing etc...) His point was that an atheist will never be able to have a set in stone moral compass to follow because it is simply subjective and by that it is something that will be ever changing due to different people having different ideas and therefore it would be more likely to have chaos stem from it due to its changing nature.<DMinyaDMs>: That's just saying \"If an all good powerful being exist then all good all powerful being exists.\" Or rather \"if an objective moral standard dictated by God exists then an objective moral standard dictated by God exists.\" First, prove that it exists beyond \"if\" and circular reasoning. Also at least among mainstream atheism, moral realism via secular humanism is the closest we will get, can get, and need to get to objective morality. Which is a whole lot closer than saying \"because God said so.\"<Le_Dudz>: I did not argue whether God exists or not, I said if in the possiblity that he does actually exist, then it would be reasonable to think that the morality he puts forth would be an objective one and would trump any other attempts us humans can establish out of our own understand, simply due to his nature as our creator, you cannot argue against that, but proving the existance of God is another subject. And as an atheist will you will ne be able to attain \"objective\" morality simply due to the subjectivity of humans which makes morality change over time.<DMinyaDMs>: Not really, you'd then have to prove that God's morality isn't just its own subjective morality enforced by the mightiest of might. Also, even if that God exists our perspective is still subjective so it would be subjective morality either way. Except one side has a really big bully.<Le_Dudz>: the whole idea about objecivity is that its absolute (not in a tyrannical sense, because i would assume this is how you would view it) just because someone has a different opinion about it doesnt it make it any less objective, again it all depends on the source of the moral arguemtn we are trying to make, for a religious person, God is the ultimate authority, hence his morality is objective due to his nature,its like the bottom line of a certain situation. even if the perspective that we see morality through is subjective (ai humainity) it doesnt render an objective matter subjective.<DMinyaDMs>: True, but it does mean appealing to God (which is not objective anyway) doesn't solve moral relativism. And in fact, it's a mistake to be so stuck in objective good and evil rather than just well-being and suffering which can be objectively assessed. <Le_Dudz>: no it doesnt solve it obviously because the whole idea isnt to tackle moral relitivism. It has to do with how you perceive this existance and its significance, and obviously appealing to God is subjective (you choose to do it or not). I wouldnt say its a mistake to habe an objective view of morality, while it does limit one to not habe the ability to choose various outcomes, it does prevent or lessen potential chaos from occuring due to the unpredictive nature of subjictivity, i wouldnt even say its even up to us to be stuck or not, rather take them as guidelines and adapt them within there work frame. your last point is good only in the situation where well-being/suffering is considered, in certain situation you could have more variables in play. <DMinyaDMs>: Tackling moral relativism can be accomplished more fruitfully via reason and evidence in the pursuit of increasing well-being and reducing suffering. Good and evil are relativist and thus useless to focus on but well-being and suffering are not. Dogmatically believing God is the basis for objectively morality may limit chaos (whatever that is supposed to mean) but it has a tendency to limit progress as well, and is inflexible. <Le_Dudz>: you are still basing that reasoning and evidence on your subjective outlook of a certain situation which would be affected by numerous factors (internal and external) and that can also create problems due to the subjctive nature used, i wouldnt put limitations on something thay has set rules, rather I would argue it is a \"safer option\" being flexible doesnt necessarily mean having a higher chance for progress, but rather being more open tk a larger number of outcomes.<DMinyaDMs>: Reason is reasonable, yes? What is not reasonable is not reasonable. If you wish to dispute this, you'll have to appeal to reason to prove why reason isn't reasonable. If your position is \"how can we trust reason\", then you probably aren't very reasonable then, or are just obfuscating. But yes, there can be a disparity between what is actually reasonable and my ability to reason. Do we then not rely on reason, leaving only irrationality to guide us? Pragmatically, better to rely on reason than not. And again, religion itself is subjective, only with more dogmatism, and irrationality. How is that at all better? It's actually worse, because nothing is being solved but rather we'd be pretending that morality is solved. <Le_Dudz>: again you are not getting what i am saying, i never claimed thay reason is unreasonabls, i said reasoning can be subjective depending on the perspective you see life through, so something that migjt make sense to u doesnt necessarily mean it has to make sense go me, and there is nothing wrong in that, becuase each one of us might be basing his reasoning on completely different premisses, i consider the religion itself as objective, but its interpretation goes back to eavh individual, dogmatism only happens with religion if you dont question what you believe in, and try to attaun truth sincerely, i never said that morality would be solvrd, rather there would be a system that we could use to base it on.<DMinyaDMs>: You can *rationalize* anything but not everything is *rational*. Religion is irrational. Sure you can base morality on religion, you could also base it on anything else you might come up with just the same. Doesn't make those belief systems conducive to increasing human well-being and/or reducing human suffering. That said, basing morality on religion is a bad idea in and of itself, because religion is inherently dogmatic and irrational, and predicated on ignorance, which leads to pathology (especially in practice). Better to use reason and evidence to find out what is actually conducive to well-being and what is actually inconducise to suffering than to rely on the dogma of religion and just say \"because God said so.\" Because even then you have to show why we should care what your or any God says.<Le_Dudz>: And I would say atheism to a certain extent is irrational, being an atheist at one point and believe in a creator now, but I have my own reasons to think that, I understand that you establish a set of morals without religion, using your thinking and reasoning faculties, but what I am saying is if the scenario of God existing is true, then whatever you come up with will be trumped with what God puts forth, due to the dynamics of that situation (unless you would be arrogant enough to assume that you could conceivable come up with something better than an all powerful transcendent being that made you and knows you better than you know yourself). Religion today is misrepresented because it is labeled as a degenerative aspect of humanity, but I think it is frankly misrepresented and misinterpreted. (I got home safely!!)<DMinyaDMs>: Being atheist is just *not* believing in God. It can be simple absence of belief (agnostic atheist). Or an assertion that God doesn't and can't exist (Gnostic atheist). And I certainly would question that being's authority. After all, first we have to prove that it's all powerful, all knowing and all good. If we go by what that God supposedly dictated to humans via holy books, we find barbarism, ignorance, and atrocity all commited or condones by a God. Religion today isn't misinterpreted unless you mean by religious apologist who don't like acknowledging bad things in their holy books and thus seek to sooth their cognitive dissonance as well proselytize via obfuscating, downplaying, deflecting from, and sometimes outright defending the bad stuff in their holy books (that even they sometimes don't agree with!) all while not providing any sufficient evidence and thus reason to beleive in their God other than coercion, fallacy, fear, and threats and promises that they can't prove aren't empty. But I'm curious what do you think is misrepresented about religion today by atheist and theists alike? <Edit>: There is nothing you can't believe on faith, both truth and lies, therefore faith is an unreliable way to determine truth.<Le_Dudz>: I understand that there is various level to someone believing not believing in God, whether it is lack of \u201cproof\u201d or just personal opinion, but it all still basically means the un-acknowledgement of a higher power that caused this existence to begin, regardless of your stance, if in the case God exists then logically and reasonably he would need to have all power and knowledge to cause this universe to begin, and to create everything in it, designing and bringing into existence all matter and life. The good argument will be debatable because you will bring forth examples from the Bible and other books where God did atrocious stuff to the people ( I am not a Christian btw), I believe God has certain characteristics that make him just and good, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he wouldn\u2019t establish punishment when punishment is needed ( I don\u2019t believe the stories in bible where God supposedly killed innocent children barbarically). War and conflict is part of our humanity so when God commands certain people to defend themselves I wouldn\u2019t think that they would defend themselves by just letting other people destroy them, so yes sometimes violence in certain circumstances is necessary. The misrepresentation today is painting certain people with the brush of everyone else (ex: ISIS representing the Muslim religion) the lack of knowledge people have of religion due to lack of studying or pretending that they know what they are talking about, I don\u2019t think atheist mis represent religion, they don\u2019t acknowledge it, thats different, and that goes back to fundamentally either believing the existence of God or not (its more of miss-premise than a miss representation).<DMinyaDMs>: First you have to give a coherent definition as to what a God is before you can start presupposing attributes at your leisure. For example, you're assuming that if a God exist then it must be all-good, which is just as valid as assuming it must be amoral or immoral. Certainly if we go by any holy book from the abrahamic religions God is a moral monster where essentially God gets to dictate morality because might makes right and God is the mightiest which seems to contribute greatly to his fragile ego, inept mental faculties, and narcissistic personality. I notice you keep saying \"if\" God exists, well, you've got a very big #IF right there. <Edit>: if we are God's children, then God is an abusive parent. Even if you could thoroughly prove the existence of whatever God you're appealing to (which you can't), I still wouldn't worship it (well not the God of any Abrahamic religion anyway, not that the others are much better).<Le_Dudz>: I don\u2019t assume anything of God, I only go by what he told me about himself, it would be unwise to speculate about the characteristics of God basing it only on personal experience, and no I don\u2019t picture God as an old man sitting in the cloud half naked (sorry to disappoint you) again, all angry because people aren\u2019t worshiping him, you are just throwing stuff out there with no prior knowledge of what I actually believe in, again you have to understand that this world is not all rainbow and sunshine and people running in gardens and fields all day, as humans conflict is part of us,the concept of war and killing exists and if you think people can just do whatever they want without consequences then why do governments and laws exist, just like our human law exist, there is a Divine law established, simple as that, but to get that you might need to believe in God in the first place, (remember what I said earlier it\u2019s an existential view that you need to understand and establish for stuff to make sense). I was taking in hypothetical terms (if) because we were discussing morality, personally I have my reasons to believe God exists (being an atheist at some point, it took a while to get where I am today). I feel like you think of God as a bully or someone has leverage and uses it as a game, which for me is not the case, but wouldn\u2019t it make sense that the one who created you establishes what is actually morally good for you or not? I mean It makes sense that he would set the rules no? And I am not talking about the light aspect you were talking about. I am Muslim, so my concept of God can be summarized through his 99 names that display his attributes, you can find them online if you do a quick search.<DMinyaDMs>: &gt; I don\u2019t assume anything of God, Yet you assume God is all good. &gt; I only go by what he told me about himself, it would be unwise to speculate about the characteristics of God basing it only on personal experience, What did he tell you? Though I doubt God spoke to you. Actually I am positive he didn't. Unless you mean you read one of those holy books where God appears to be an egotiscal maniacal narcissist. One of the ten commandments after all is \"thou shalt have no God before me\" (is he implying that there are other Gods??? Hmm) after all. &gt; I don\u2019t picture God as an old man sitting in the cloud half naked (sorry to disappoint you) again, This is a strawman. I never said you did. Quit projecting. &gt; you are just throwing stuff out there with no prior knowledge of what I actually believe in, Another strawman. I am merely alluding to the bible itself where God is on record commuting atrocity and condoning barbarism. &gt; again you have to understand that this world is not all rainbow and sunshine and people running in gardens and fields all day, as humans conflict is part of us,the concept of war and killing exists This another strawman, and a nonsequitor. It's irrelevant. It doesn't prove that there is a God one bit but it does call into question the morality of a God who is supposed all good but not only allows evil but outright condones and commits evil himself. Again, just read the bible, objectively. &gt; if you think people can just do whatever they want without consequences Strawman. Please show me where I said this. For someone who is complaining about misrepresentation you sure don't like accurately representing what I've said thus far. Though nothing is ultimately stopping anyone from doing anything they want, not even God. &gt; then why do governments and laws exist, To stop people from doing whatever they want (at least that's one reason). &gt; just like our human law exist, there is a Divine law established, simple as that, Okay. *Prove it*. Or is this so called divine law just human law called divine? I have no reason to believe it isn't and you have no proof to indicate that it isn't. Again, *prove it*. &gt; but to get that you might need to believe in God in the first place, (remember what I said earlier it\u2019s an existential view that you need to understand and establish for stuff to make sense). You mean it's a circular view. It'd be a lot easier to believe if you or God could just provide sufficient evidence. &gt; I was taking in hypothetical terms (if) because we were discussing morality, personally I have my reasons to believe God exists (being an atheist at some point, it took a while to get where I am today). Doesn't matter why you believe it, it's still an irrational belief if not founded upon sufficient evidence and logic. Simply believing it doesn't make it true, after all. &gt; I feel like you think of God as a bully or someone has leverage and uses it as a game, God as displayed in the Bible is not moral, fair or just. &gt; which for me is not the case, It doesn't help God's case when he commits atrocity and condones barbarism, and I should also mention actively ensures ignorance. &gt; but wouldn\u2019t it make sense that the one who created you establishes what is actually morally good for you or not? Not inherently no. Doesn't make anymore sense for God to decide just because he supposedly made us (prove it) than for a parent to be able to torture their kids because they made them. &gt; I mean It makes sense that he would set the rules no? It would also make sense for an immoral God to make immoral rules. An unfair God to make unfair rules. And an unjust God to make unjust rules. You have not proven that God is all good, much less that he exists. And all \"evidence\" (and that evidence is insufficient anyway) points to God simply being an all-powerful bully with no one but it's own convoluted, esoteric interests in mind (if God isn't simply incompetent). &gt; And I am not talking about the light aspect you were talking about. Are you admitting here that God isn't all good? If God isn't all Good why should I care what he thinks? I am morally obligated to oppose any God who isn't all good. &gt; I am Muslim, so my concept of God can be summarized through his 99 names that display his attributes, you can find them online if you do a quick search Instead of 99 names just provide 1 piece of adequate proof please. <Le_Dudz>: the first two points are interconnected, so thay answers tour fiest question, the second one was obviously what I read through scripture and again as I said i wasnt a christian in my previous comment so no need to go through the bible, the imperical proof that you are looking doesnt exist because you are using the eorng measuring stick to obtain \"proof\" science is only based on imperical evidence that basis its validity of your 5 senses, so when you start talking about a mwta pgysical being you couldnt possibly ask for \"proof\" in that sense, the mere existance of this universe is evidence for God, but that doesnt convince you, instead ask yourself, what would be actual evidence for me that might convincd me of God if it was there, i mean these days even if you present evidence, you could easily brush it off depending on your level of skepticism, and from what o have from you so far, you have alot of it. like i said it took a long time for me, although obviously subjective experience to believe what i believe, but for me it was that this universe couldnt juat spontaneouslt pop into existance, that was the trigger and after that there was many different arguments that strengthened what i believe in.<DMinyaDMs>: &gt; the first two points are interconnected, so thay answers tour fiest question, the second one was obviously what I read through scripture Summarize your points. I might've missed them. &gt; and again as I said i wasnt a christian in my previous comment so no need to go through the bible, Replace the word bible with quaran or whatever and my point remains the same. I think both books are bad books anyway. &gt; the imperical proof that you are looking doesnt exist because you are using the eorng measuring stick to obtain \"proof\" science is only based on imperical evidence that basis its validity of your 5 senses, So you believe in something you can't prove. Yep. That's irrational. &gt; so when you start talking about a mwta pgysical being you couldnt possibly ask for \"proof\" I can and am. I don't believe in things based on faith because faith is unreliable. I need sufficient evidence. So far your God has all the qualities of something that doesn't exist. &gt; in that sense, the mere existance of this universe is evidence for God Not it isnt. It's evidence of the universe, you're presupposing God. That's circular reasoning. Not very convincing at all. &gt; but that doesnt convince you, instead ask yourself, what would be actual evidence for me that might convincd me of God if it was there, Dunno, you're the one asserting that something exist without evidence. You might as well be saying leprechauns (of Irish folklore) exist for all I care. It's just as valid an assertion. You can believe anything based on faith after all. &gt; i mean these days even if you present evidence, you could easily brush it off depending on your level of skepticism, and from what o have from you so far, you have alot of it. My skepticism is proportional to the lack of evidence and abundance of evidence to the contrary. &gt; like i said it took a long time for me, although obviously subjective experience to believe what i believe, but for me it was that this universe couldnt juat spontaneouslt pop into existance, that was the trigger and after that there was many different arguments that strengthened what i believe in. So basically you have no good reason to believe. It's basically an argument from ignorance (a fallacy). Just because you don't know something doesn't mean you get to assert an answer without sufficient evidence and adequate explanation. You're solving a mystery by appealing to a greater mystery and calling it God. Then you're assigning all sorts of convenient attributes to said God. You say there are many different arguments but considering you haven't provided a single good argument, they were probably all very bad (fallacious, predicated on ignorance) arguments and it's just that you aren't a very critical thinker is all.<Le_Dudz>: Alot of pre assumptions were made by you, anywho for each his own beliefs at the end of the day whether you believe in God or you don't its a personal decision, i do believe that there's a certain faith aspect to believing in God and what his messenger came forth with, like I said my reasons may not convince you, that doesnt mean they arent good reasons for me, it is not irrational that assume that for something to come into existance it has to have a trigger, unless that a ball can just pop into existance just like that for no reason. my cause for this existance is God, because i dont believe that the structure you see in the universe is there due to randomness and unconsious creation, i feel that that is irrational. the Bible and the Quran are not the same thing, God is not portrayed the same way in both ooks so that does make a difference. what i was trying to say in regards to evidence is that if you are only looking through the lense of science to try and prove the existance of God then you will never be able to, because God doesnt operate in this universe, so again you are using the wrong measuring stick to try and find what you are looking for (supposedly if you are actually entertaining the idea of God exisiting), you will never prove God through science, so maybe try a different approach. As I said before, for me this universe, and its fine tunning requires, for me, a concious knoweledge, powerful cause that could have brough things into there current state. At the end of the day if God created the universe then he is its cause and threrefore they are interconnected, regardless if its a preassumption or not. A long time and looking into alot of different things and reading things isnt no good reasom to believe, they are for me, hence i believe what I believe. i never asserted anything, I just told you why I believe what I believe no more no less.<DMinyaDMs>: &gt; Alot of pre assumptions were made by you, Says the guy presupposing a God because \"I can't think of anything else.\" (paraphrasing) Saying \"I don't know\" is perfectly okay, but don't pretend to know things you don't or can't. &gt; anywho for each his own beliefs at the end of the day whether you believe in God or you don't its a personal decision, Yep. And one of is right and the other is wrong. One of us is rational and the other irrational. We know that much at least. (It's you by the way just sayin') &gt; i do believe that there's a certain faith aspect to believing in God and what his messenger came forth with, Yes. Belief without evidence. You can believe anything based on faith, and be just as wrong. Faith doesn't absolve irrationality. &gt; like I said my reasons may not convince you, that doesnt mean they arent good reasons for me Except there aren't any good reasons for you, you just admitted to believing based on faith after all. &gt; it is not irrational that assume that for something to come into existance it has to have a trigger, unless that a ball can just pop into existance just like that for no reason. You mean like your God \"popped into existence for no reason?\" And you're not only assuming that the trigger is a God, but your specific God, all without providing any evidence beyond \"faith\" or \"I can't think of anything else so it must be God.\" &gt; because i dont believe that the structure you see in the universe is there due to randomness and unconsious creation, i feel that that is irrational Doesn't matter how you feel. Your feelings don't make it true. Your feelings have no bearing on reality. &gt; the Bible and the Quran are not the same thing, God is not portrayed the same way in both ooks so that does make a difference. What the bible and quaran do have in common is that the God of both books is an egoistical, maniacal, narcissistic moral monster. And they both lack evidence. &gt; what i was trying to say in regards to evidence is that if you are only looking through the lense of science to try and prove the existance of God then you will never be able to, because God doesnt operate in this universe, so again you are using the wrong measuring stick to try and find what you are looking for (supposedly if you are actually entertaining the idea of God exisiting) How could something exist outside of space and time? That has all the qualities of something that simply doesn't exist. Yet you think it is irrational for the universe to come from nothing, but not God himself to come from nothing? Sounds like you found what you are looking for via confirmation bias, fallacious reasoning, insufficient evidence, and wishful thinking. &gt; As I said before, for me this universe, and its fine tunning requires, for me, a concious knoweledge, powerful cause that could have brough things into there current state. Doesn't matter how you feel, doesn't make it true. And why assume that this entity you've conjured up even cares about humanity? For all you know, it could just be indifferent (but again, you don't have evidence to prove anything either way). &gt; At the end of the day if God created the universe then he is its cause and threrefore they are interconnected, regardless if its a preassumption or not. That is a big, unlikely, unsubstantiated #IF on your part. &gt; A long time and looking into alot of different things and reading things isnt no good reasom to believe, they are for me, hence i believe what I believe. i never asserted anything, I just told you why I believe what I believe no more no less.' Yes. Because you are irrational. You believe in things without evidence. Your God is just as valid as pixies and leprechauns. Sorry to break it to you.<Le_Dudz>: well you didnt beak anything, its your opinion, and you are entitled to it, no need to be condescending.<DMinyaDMs>: Calling an irrational belief irrational is not condescending. &amp;#x200B; Everyone is entitled to their opinions, doesn't make them true.<Le_Dudz>: the irrationality is your opinion, doesnt make it irrational to me or any other person that is a theist, just because it doesnt into your definition of existance doesnt make any less valid from your version of reality, it just makes it different. You'll find out for sure one day i guess.<DMinyaDMs>: Reason is reasonable. What is unreasonable can't be reasoned. If your opinions or beliefs are unreasonable (irrational) they are indeed less valid. After all, you can believe absolutely positively anything based on faith. &gt; You'll find out for sure one day i guess. Same for you. Til then, I'm not going to believe anything on faith (insufficient evidence) or because it's comforting. <Edit>: I'm actually a dragon from 2,000 years in the future, and I am logged into Reddit speaking to you. You just have to have faith to believe it. <Le_Dudz>: again, this is your opinion on the subject in regards to rationality, its your world view, you can have it man, i used to believe the same thing, we didnt have proof of ultra violet light 100 years ago, did that make it not exist back then? you can believe whatever you want to believe, let other people believe what they want, for each his reasons, doesnt make mine any less valid...Still your \"evidence\" is only based on impericilism and that, unfortunately doesnt encompass all of what is in existance...and its not because its comforting (it actually isnt these days, but this is, for me, what reality is) tjere is nothing wrong with believing that this universe had a cause...<DMinyaDMs>: When we have proof then it will be rational to believe it. Until then, you are irrational for your faith.<Le_Dudz>: https://youtu.be/uqYZHrOwpLk watch this two part series, he explains my point of view pretty well. good day sir.<DMinyaDMs>: I am already aware of the fallacy of the pre-suppositionalist and pascal's wager.", "num_messages": 33, "avg_score": 101.1818181818}

Is it always your responsibility to speak up against someone else's wrongdoings? To speak out risks conflict, and we tend to avoid conflict because we pay an emotional and social cost for it.

He sent a team of volunteers to break into the cars and steal the valuables, asking the \u201cthieves\u201d to act in an obviously suspicious manner.

Then Rini points out existing epistemic reliability scores (already used internally by companies like Facebook) can be made public so as to improve our information-sharing incentives. A bit like Twitter\u2019s verification checkmarks, online profiles would have a color-coded symbol next to their name. The color would indicate the degree to which users share information after they are informed that it is false, misleading, uncorroborated, etc. That way, our online sharing practices impact our public reputation and, likewise, we can easily see the epistemic reputation of someone who shares new, shocking, or upsetting information with us. Readers who want more detail and rigor than op ed style writing should read Rini\u2019s peer-reviewed paper on this: [**Fake News and Partisan Epistemology**](https://kiej.georgetown.edu/fake-news-partisan-epistemology/) **Abstract**. This paper does four things: (1) It provides an analysis of the concept \u2018fake news.\u2019 (2) It identifies distinctive epistemic features of social media testimony. (3) It argues that partisanship-in-testimony-reception is not always epistemically vicious; in fact some forms of partisanship are consistent with individual epistemic virtue. (4) It argues that a solution to the problem of fake news will require changes to institutions, such as social media platforms, not just to individual epistemic practices.<Solid_Waste>: The article claims this \"isn't censorship\" which seems to miss the point. Very few of the disinformation tactics used in social media today rely on outright censorship, yet they still have a significant impact on public discourse. The point is what good does a \"reliability\" indicator do if the entity providing the indicator is itself unreliable? Is *Facebook* really the entity we should have determining the reliability of our public discourse? Is that better than no reliability at all, or worse? For example, does anyone have *any* doubt that criticism of Facebook would be labeled \"unreliable\"?<byrd_nick>: Is it Facebook that is determining what is reliable or just Facebook that is curating the information/facts so that then determine what is reliable? But suppose it is Facebook who determines what is reliable: how is Facebook\u2019s determination fundamentally different than what fact-checking sites, journalists, and even individual consumers of facts do? Finally, people are presented with more information than any one person can thoroughly fact check on their own. So if we care about the accuracy of information being shared and consumed, then we have no choice but to outsource *some* of that fact-checking to *some* entity/entities. The choice is not about whether or not entities like Facebook should determine reliability; the choice is between better and worse ways of letting entities like Facebook help us determine reliability.", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 3.0}

Economically, for example, there are some industries that simple societies cannot undertake. They simply lack the infrastructure. You can measure the complexity by counting the number of contributory processes that have to fan in to allow the completion of the task, and with the UN we quantified a range of IUCN codes. The 'complexity' number that emerged was the base ten logarithm of the number of components that had to fan in: weaving cloth by hand had a number under unity, building a passenger jet had a number close to 40. (That is, at least 10^40 times more complex.) Wages tended to follow industrial complexity. Close work showed that what needed to fan in was more complicated than mere industrial process, transport and so on. You needed law, a trained work force, financing; indeed, the full panoply of a society. We addressed this under three headings: economic, social and institutional complexity. (As everyone now knows, the chief difference between societies which develop and those which don't is their institutional capacity - around 60% of the variation 1950-present is explained by this one thing, across 80+ countries.) Now, the conservative thing. These three domains move at different rates. Commerce has a half life of under a decade. Social accords are at best generational, say 30 years. Formal institutions, though, move far slower - fifth years to be kind, a hundred to be realistic. When commerce takes off, therefore, the other two are placed under immense strain. The groans are heard from the social structures, but it is the institutions that are both the least flexible and the most important, as noted above. Conservatives feel these stresses in their bones. The less thoughtful focus on social tensions, and are the Leftist authoritarians to who Scruton refers. (Note that conservatives can be of any political complexion save the liberal, which is also neither confined neither to left nor right. Liberals are those who do not feel these tensions, and accept change without much concern.) However, the more systems-aware conservatives see the institutions of society as being under strain and being in need of protection. These structures are the girders in the steel frame, unseen but essential. They set out to defend them from rust and erosion. However, they are not always wise in the institutions which they pick - from the 1770s French monarchy to established religion - and their desire to protect can often impede adaptation, as with the nuclear family. But hey! [Nobody's perfect](http://www.chforum.org/scenario2012/paper1-6.jpg). <agent00F>: Funny then that the scientists at the leading edge of human possibility are order of magnitude more liberal than conservative. In contrast, the classes most associated with the right today are the lowest common denominator of American society.<Bigwooddeck>: Scientists are educated in facts, not values. Given that politics is largely a values based domain scientists have no special insight.<the_fancy_sings>: Politics is *motivated* by values, sure, but what distinguishes politics from political or moral theory is that it goes on to engage, actively and deeply, with society. Facts may be orthogonal to values, but they're pretty crucial for apt engagement with the world. Or, for that matter, for apt disengagement.<Bigwooddeck>: What outcomes we ought to pursue is fundamentally a normative question. How best to achieve those outcomes as a society is informed by facts, but what outcomes we ought to work toward to begin with is strictly a values question, save for facts about an individual's personal psychology and preferences. If person A prefers living in a more culturally homogenous society, science and engineering have nothing to say about it. People prefer what they prefer, and through politics you try to point society's development in the direction of your preferences. <the_fancy_sings>: Scientists (and other domain experts) aren't there to tell us what worlds we ought to prefer; they're there to tell us what worlds we can actually reach. No matter lovely the shore, if shallow boulders will wreck any approaching ship, it's best to sail on. The only thing that person A is an authority on is what he *currently believes* would make him happier. If he doesn't understand what a more culturally homogeneous society would entail, it's quite possible that trying to give him what he claims to prefer would make him miserable. If what he wants is the *pursuit* of cultural homogeneity, and damn the consequences, then he may say as much, so that we can all give his vision all the respect it deserves.<Bigwooddeck>: It's not some theoretical nonsense like capitalism vs socialism. Different regions of America are more or less diverse than each other; people can experience both and know what they prefer. It's not wrong to prefer diversity, and it's not wrong to prefer homogeneity. As for saying as much, one beauty of democracy is that the voting booth is a private place. You can cast your vote without having to account to vociferous loudmouths of any political persuasion.<the_fancy_sings>: And yet here we are, doing just what we needn't. =P So, there are two things going on here: the general question of facts and values and policy, and the particular question of cultural homogeneity. I've been trying to speak to the general case. A better example for my position would be something like an energy economy oriented around fossil fuels: it would be lovely if every oil well were bottomless, and every hydrocarbon burned clean as angel bones, but the world has a say. As far as homogeneity, I agree that it's not wrong\u2014by my lights\u2014to simply prefer one or the other. But that doesn't automatically mean that policies in pursuit of one or the other are politically feasible and clean-burning. There are prerequisites and externalities, and domain experts' role is to make it harder to ignore those. So, for example: if giving person A their preferred society requires banning Muslims from the county, that's going to be a problem in light of certain prior commitments. If it's going to adversely impact the local economy, that's going to be an important consideration.<Bigwooddeck>: Questions about energy policy are more value laden than I think you're willing to concede. Should we direct our energy policy towards what's best for future persons, or people currently in being? If the latter, keep burning the fossil fuels. If the former, scientists aren't in agreement about the course of action we should take. This can be seen in discussions of a geoengineering solution to climate change. Further, what about a country like Canada? Climate change would make Canada better off by increasing the quality of their land (among other improvements). Source on Canada : https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-change-economy-1.3282446<the_fancy_sings>: No, I'm perfectly happy to concede it. Climatologists didn't end the conversation, but they put reams of information on the table, and it's on us to decide what to do with it. I'm just suggesting that ignoring it would be inappropriate. It is one thing for X to be a valid choice given certain values, and another if the political viability of X is predicated on denial of the relevant facts. I mean, if you think that writing off our great-grandchildren and boosting the quality of Canadian land would be political winners, go for it. I would argue that most people don't live in Canada, and a geopolitical situation less fraught with famine-induced refugee crises is also in Canada's interests. But hey, those are partly value judgments. (\"Most people don't live in Canada\" may or may not be a sufficient reason for you not to sacrifice the world's interests in favor of Canada's. But it is a fact with certain implications for the consequences of certain actions.)", "num_messages": 11, "avg_score": 2.0}

The above poster said he doesn't understand why so many people put the needs of anyone and everyone else ahead of the needs of the person who is actually suffering. I tried to help him understand by replying that an individual who is contemplating suicide is also contemplating asking others to deal with the loss of a loved one for the rest of their lives, thereby putting the suffering on the loved ones.

Think of the universe as a giant mind, your thoughts, emotions and body are the obvious part that you are. The chair you are sitting on ? Also generated subconsciously by that same mind. Think of a dream. You are interacting with all kind of things when you are asleep, but they are still generated by your mind. You are just not conscious enough to notice it, they are also not physical. Think of this reality as another dream to wake up from and see through the illusion. So is this true or not?

But I totally get you, I personally wrestle with this concept a lot.<Ansiroth>: Here's a good way to think about it - There is a presence inside of you that acknowledges that \"You are, you exist.\" Philosophically it is the only thing that we can be 100% certain of - \"I am having a conscious experience.\" Now notice that awareness within you, that it in fact exists in some shape or form. Now consider that this force of awareness is not bound to you some place inside, it is a force that permeates all of existence. The part of you that knows that you are is not separate from the part of me that knows that I am.<GronkaIsComing2town>: &gt; Now consider that this force of awareness is not bound to you some place inside, it is a force that permeates all of existence. Tell me what's happening in the core of Jupiter right now, then <Ansiroth>: This is actually a good sequitur because it allows the illustration of the divide between the mind and awareness. The mind gives rise to the awareness of awareness itself. It has an extra layer because of the mind. Awareness permeates all of existence, however minds are individual and bound by the senses. This gives rise to the illusion of separation.<GronkaIsComing2town>: You're just making claims without any evidence. Sounds almost like religion. Small alterations in the physical brain can radically change or snuff out someone's awareness. <LITERALLY_SHREK>: There is no way to provide evidence for this. The only thing you can do is take the leap of faith and do spiritual practices to confirm it for yourself, no scientist or preacher can do that for you.<CrazyMoonlander>: Quite literally what religion and faith is. If you can't provide evidence for something, it's pointless to discuss or even think about.<LITERALLY_SHREK>: Actually there is scientific evidence that yoga and meditation changes structure in the brain. And if there werent it wouldnt matter beause there is tons of anecdotal evidence. And if that wouldnt be the case it wouldnt matter either because all you have to do is try it out for yourself. its not religion/faith. You dont have to accept any dogma, and you dont have to pray to some god. You basically just do the practices and do an empirical investigation. Its really not rocket science.<CrazyMoonlander>: &gt; Actually there is scientific evidence that yoga and meditation changes structure in the brain. Sure, that's not what we're talking about though. It's unecessary to talk about things that can't be observed.<LITERALLY_SHREK>: what would that observation look like when its a highly subjective experience<CrazyMoonlander>: That's why faith and religion aren't scientific. You can't empirically test them. And we're not talking about testing whether a person personally believe something. We're talking about testing what the person believes in. Hence why it's no reason to discuss it. If it's unobservable, there's no point.<LITERALLY_SHREK>: no reason to discuss it from a scientific viewpoint maybe but no reason to discuss whataoever? <CrazyMoonlander>: Why discuss something with no basis in reality whatsoever?

What do other people think?<Generico300>: I think the issue is that as the idea of \"correct\" becomes more ambiguous, so does the distinction between bullshit and expertise. At a certain point, your field becomes so abstract that it's effectively impossible to separate a right answer from a wrong answer, and therefore impossible to separate a bullshiter from an expert; at which point they're effectively the same thing. Objectively separating a right answer from a wrong answer is usually best done with empirical data.

Yeah this isn't true at all. Plenty of work in philosophy depends on deductively valid arguments, and thus can be \"right\" or \"wrong\" on a logical level. But even where things get more \"abstract\" as you put it, there's still tons of background information, technical terminology, relevant literature, etc. that you need to be familiar with in order to understand the majority of the discourse in philosophy, literary criticism, and other non-empirical fields, let alone to be able to construct any sort of coherent argument yourself.

Anything you just described that you dismiss, such as making stuff up, normative claims, aesthetic claims, or any other cannot be wrong or incorrect unless they have an empirical element.

You go further to say that \\&gt; you can't simply derive non-empirical claims--normative, aesthetic, or otherwise--from empirical data itself, in any field. and the response is... can't I? If the claims have no way of determining if they are true or false then you can derive the claims from anything. So the poster has a point, unless you can demonstrate the truth of a claim it is simply an un-falsifiable statement and therefore equal in validity to any other non-falsifiable statement.

But I'm not going to argue with you about whether or not positivism is correct. Though if you do a bit of research I think you'll find that it's a fairly outmoded and unpopular position, especially its more extreme tendency, which you seem to be endorsing.<UnknownLoginInfo>: So your argument is correct because your framework is different, and my argument is correct because my framework is different... This would mean the reply you gave to the OP is a confirmation of the problem they were pointing out. The post is correct because their framework is different and therefore your argument is incorrect because it does not adress the post on its framework and does not attempt to invalidate that framework. You in effect did not adress the argument at all. Hence why people say that you are \"talking in circles\" or the arguments go on infinitly. Calling something outmoded or unpopular does not make it wrong. Dismissing it as such, as opposed addressing the underlying concern given is avoiding the argument altogether (again, proving the post correct). You also just appealed to popularity. In the end, I think you gave a good example of the exact problems the post was pointing out.

Or math and logic?<UnknownLoginInfo>: There is a lot to unpack in your question. Who said they are talking about nothing? That is a strawman and a useless question. We can add this to your appeal to popularity as... I dont know... a decent into sophistry? The epistemological view you claim I have answers the questions you just posed. Why would you suggest I look at something (claiming I have that stance) and then come back around and ask something already adressed? I could, quite simply, copy paste the response out of a text book. To further muddle the waters I have already answered this question and I have not claimed they have no value. If you are curious like you say, could you craft a question that addresses a claim I have made? I think that would probably be more productive. To kick this off in the spirit of a good debate I will ask a question. Can you give me a non emperical statement that is not self contained that you can prove to be true or false? You claim to not agree with this statement, and since you seem to think that all the examples you have given have exceptions to this I would like to see one.<yungdrunk>: &gt; If you are curious like you say, could you craft a question that addresses a claim I have made? I think that would probably be more productive. I did this in the past several posts I made, despite still being hardly able to understand what you're trying to get at. Your previous response was a single sentence, posted a week after the fact. Again, I'm not interested in a \"debate\" about epistemology that is entirely unrelated to the post I originally replied to, especially since you're apparently not interested in confirming or clarifying what you mean. So no, thanks. Feel free to have the last word.<UnknownLoginInfo>: Your entire argument against the post hinges on the claim that a non emperical statement that is not self contained can proven to be true or false. You make that claim twice in the initial post and without that underlying claim your argument is nonsensical. When someone complains that you cant prove anything and are simply talking out of your ass (op), the solution you arrive at is to say you dont really have to prove anything and really we are just using different epistemological frameworks. You make the claim there are fields that deal in the non emperical and not self contained, and then refuse to back up that claim. It simply \"is\" and any claim otherwise is hand waved away. If it is difficult to understand why this is a problem, then perhaps this might be the exact problem the op pointed out. You cant prove anything. This of course is said whith the expectation that you will not respond. If anyone else reads this thread I would be grateful if you could let me know if I am off base here. Am I being unclear? Thank you in advance. <yungdrunk>: Alright, let's talk. To recap: I originally objected to the claim that its \u201cimpossible to separate a bullshitter from an expert\u201d in \u201cabstract\u201d fields like literary criticism and philosophy, where \u201cabstract\u201d means lacking \u201cempirical data\u201d. This is what I initially objected to: that any idiot could start writing literary criticism or philosophy and be taken as seriously as an expert. I said nothing about whether non-empirical claims can be \u201cproven\u201d true or false. I did say that we consider logically valid arguments to be valid, and that empirical data is mostly relevant to empirical fields of study. Further, the OP\u2019s claim is predicated on the assumption that \u201cObjectively separating a right answer from a wrong answer is usually best done with empirical data.\u201d This is already a non-empirical, philosophical claim: it is about how we should distinguish truths from falsehoods. So presumably the OP thinks that such statements can be true, despite being non-empirical. You then suggest (as far as I can make out) that there is \u201cno way of determining\u201d whether non-empirical claims are true or false, because they are unfalsifiable or not \u201cself-contained\u201d (I have no idea what this latter term is supposed to mean, but I\u2019m guessing it means something like analytic as opposed to synthetic). So presumably you are already working with different assumptions than the OP, unless you\u2019re of the opinion that we are able to empirically verify value judgments. I found this odd, since you\u2019re addressing a claim that I didn\u2019t make, and asked for clarification. But you were apparently more interested in trying to catch me in logical fallacies (which, as an aside, is a really shallow and ultimately nonproductive way to make an argument). &gt; The epistemological view you claim I have answers the questions you just posed. Why would you suggest I look at something (claiming I have that stance) and then come back around and ask something already adressed? I could, quite simply, copy paste the response out of a text book. To further muddle the waters I have already answered this question and I have not claimed they have no value. Did you address it? Because I see you nowhere saying that you are or are not a positivist, or that any of the disciplines I mentioned are meaningful or valuable. And assuming you agree that they are, then they must contain some meaningful content such that the input of some random person picked off the street would not be equivalent in worth to that of an expert who works in the field. &gt; When someone complains that you cant prove anything and are simply talking out of your ass (op), the solution you arrive at is to say you dont really have to prove anything and really we are just using different epistemological frameworks. You make the claim there are fields that deal in the non emperical and not self contained, and then refuse to back up that claim. It simply \"is\" and any claim otherwise is hand waved away. Again, I think you are mostly projecting here. The OP made a claim about a connection between empirical data and judging claims to be right or wrong, in relation to a claim about displaying expertise. And my response had to do with whether someone could plausibly fake being a expert in literary criticism or philosophy, which could be true whether or not there actually are objectively true judgments in either field. As far as non-empirical statements go, this isn\u2019t really about my proving to you that any non-empirical statements are true or false\u2014rather, it\u2019s about whether they *could* be. Assuming we are talking about truth as correspondence, i.e. as corresponding to how things are in reality, when I say \u201cwe ought not to torture babies for fun\u201d, I\u2019m making a non-empirical, normative statement about how the world is (by the way, \u201cnormative\u201d is a technical descriptive term, so you can\u2019t just declare that any random phrase whatsoever is normative). Most people, including most moral philosophers, would say this is objectively true. However, it is not something we can verify empirically: we can\u2019t go to the lab and do experiments to see whether or not it is correct, nor can we go out into the world and gather data about the relevant moral facts. As already stated, deductive logic and mathematics are also non-empirical disciplines that produce truths. Much of history is also non-empirical. So is the entirety of metaphysics. Further, empirical science itself depends on the truth of non-empirical axioms, e.g., that natural phenomena are consistent such that they admit of description by universal laws, a claim that we cannot prove empirically. This is only one of the many deeper issues with the notion that empirical science is a neutral arbiter of truths. So, unless I'm entirely misunderstanding you (which I'm not sure I'd be at fault for doing), then there's no way we would have any sort of productive argument about the original matter in question.", "num_messages": 17, "avg_score": 43.4117647059}

Just because something is falsifiable, thereby being classified as scientific as opposed to pseudoscientific, that does not mean it is logically true. The writer of this article then goes on to contradict himself in that exact same vein: &gt; We can\u2019t ever prove our theory to be true, but we can show that it is preferable to all earlier theories. In other words, science is about finding the best current explanation. It is also about making sure our theories are ever more specific, are making increasingly detailed predictions, and are subject to increasingly detailed testing. If you can't prove a theory to be true (logically), then you have not 'adequately' resolved the problem of induction. <Reschiiv>: Why do you need to prove a theory to be logically true to solve the problem of induction? The way I see it, and from my understanding of Popper I think he would too, the problem of inductions essentially is a problem because (1) induction doesn't make any sense and (2) we have knowledge that seems to have been created by induction. If you look at the problem of induction that way, you could solve it either by explaining why induction does make sense or by coming up with another theory of how the knowledge (which seemed to be created by induction) was created. Popper did the latter of the two. Do you think that coming up with an alternative explanation (regardless if you think Poppers alternative actually was better than induction) of the knowledge is an adequat solution to the problem of induction? <weepmelancholia>: Popper doesn't 'solve' the problem of induction (which is concerned with knowledge in its classical sense), but, rather, proposes a new type of knowledge. Thus, he removes the realm of science away from the problem insofar as this new type of knowledge is not *meant* to be logically true. So, therefore, he does not *solve* it--as the author of this article writes--because the problem is still extant, but simply proposes scientific knowledge to be a different kind of knowledge, thereby not being affected by the problem of induction in the first place. Popper did not solve the problem of induction; he solved science being affected by it. Those are two very different things, because as soon as inductive science claims to be logically true (which is happening in scientism movements), the problem of induction comes back into force.<Reschiiv>: I think that counts as a solution. Given that we no longer think knowledge is created by induction (since we know of Poppers alternative), why would we care about that induction doesn't make any sense and therefore can't explain the growth of knowledge?

So you're completely discounting the likelihood that the victim's family's would not accept any such restitution, contra your original claim that \"the victim, the perpetrator and the court agree on [a restitution that] makes sense\". Now such restitution will be forced on the victim's families. &gt; Any criminal capable of rehabilitation should not be imprisoned and any criminal requiring a lifetime of imprisonment does not deserve to have society bear that cost. This completely ignores the reality that meeting the standard of proof required is more expensive than simply imprisoning them. I'm all for prison reform, but dishonest and unrealistic characterizations of what's required of a justice system centered around reform doesn't help this case.<Lemmiwinks99>: In the sense that not having publicly funded prisons is forcing victims to accept restitution then yes they are forced to accept some restitution. As I said I believe this is better for them and for us for that to be the case. Also as I said if there is some demand for imprisonments within such a system I\u2019d happily allow for victims and criminals to fund those out of their own pockets. Part of my main point is that anyone who we believe truly deserves to be locked away for life with no chance to better themselves or society would preferably be removed from society rather than sustained by it. It is true that in the current system it is more expensive to sentence someone to death than to imprison them. I was not attempting to argue otherwise or to be dishonest in any way. What I am getting at is that imprisonment is more expensive than restitution and that only in very rare cases would anyone opt for death as a consequence of a crime.

This sounds strange at first blush, but \u201cpanpsychism\u201d\u2014the view that all matter has some associated consciousness\u2014is an increasingly accepted position with respect to the nature of consciousness. &gt;Biological organisms have leveraged faster information exchange through various biophysical pathways, including electrical and electrochemical pathways. These faster information flows allow for more macro-scale levels of consciousness that would occur in similar-scale structures like boulders or a pile of sand, simply because there is significantly greater connectivity and thus more \u201cgoing on\u201d in biological structures than in a boulder or a pile of sand. Boulders and piles of sand only have thermal pathways with very limited bandwidth. &gt;Boulders and piles of sand are \u201cmere aggregates\u201d or just collections of more rudimentary conscious entities (probably at the atomic or molecular level only), rather than combinations of micro-conscious entities that combine into a higher level macro-conscious entity, which is the hallmark of biological life. It basically concluded what I've thought as well, that if you go deep enough to the atomic level, everything is live and has some level of consciousness. There is no \"dead matter\" there is only higher and lower level of consciousness and the whole universe and everything in it is ALIVE. The only thing that boggles me is why am I me and not you? We are all conscious of course but we are all as well trapped in our own different levels of consciousness that we can't escape and we perceive everything from our own locked perspective totally independent of everybody and everything else.

But how? That is the hard question. Before that, Dennett distinguishes this from the \"hard **problem** of consciousness,\" which he quickly dismisses as a \"misdirection.\" What I am most interested in is his second point in the process, which he describes as an *uncontested discovery of neuroscience*. &gt;I have been arguing for decades that Chalmers was mis-focusing our attention, exaggerating an artefact of inquiry that I identified in 1991: the failure to ask, and answer, what I called the hard question: \u2018And then what happens?\u2019 The question, more specifically, is: once some item or content \u2018enters consciousness\u2019, what does this cause or enable or modify? For several reasons, researchers have typically either postponed addressing this question or failed to recognize\u2014 and assert\u2014that their research on the \u2018easy problems\u2019 can be seen as addressing and resolving aspects of the hard question, thereby indirectly dismantling the hard problem piece by piece, without need of any revolution in science. The causes of the misdirection can be uncovered by reminding ourselves of a few largely uncontentious but easily neglected discoveries of neuroscience:(i) There is no double transduction...**(ii) So, there is no place in the system for qualia, if they are conceived of as intrinsic properties instantiated by (as contrasted with represented by) some activities in the nervous system.**I have discovered that it is useful to pause at this point and invite readers to consider whether or not they actually agree with these two basic points, because their implications are highly destructive of commonplace presumptions. In particular, the widespread conviction that qualia, thus conceived, must obviously exist if we are to make sense of our introspective access to them, is an illusion, not an optical illusion or auditory illusion, but a theorist\u2019s illusion, an artefact of bad theory, not observation. Richard Power nicely captures the source of this illusion. &gt; &gt;We know that our perceptions or imaginings of trees, faces, etc. are distinct from the objects themselves. They are internal representations, representations in our minds.We understand the concept of representation from external representations, such as pictures, or verbal descriptions. For these representations we can have direct experience of both a representer (e.g. portrait painting) and a representee (e.g. the person painted). Call these the medium and the content. Thus for the Mona Lisa, the medium is a painting that hangs in the Louvre; the content is an Italian woman who modelled for the artist centuries ago. Medium and content may have attributes in common, if the representation is iconic (as they say in Semiotics). Oval partly-brown patches in the painting resemble the oval brown eyes of the Italian lady. But usually medium and content are of different stuff: oil on canvas, in the case of the Mona Lisa, as against human flesh. And in many cases the representation is symbolic, so that medium and content share no features.This is the conceptual scheme that we bring to internal representations, because it is the only one we have. But there is a huge difference. For external representations we can experience both medium and content, oil on canvas as well as people, trees, or whatever. But for internal representations, we do not experience the medium AT ALL. Only the content, along with some contextual features such as the time when the percept or imagining occurred. The idea of a spiritual consciousness arises from the illusion that we DO experience the medium of our internal representations, and that it is iconic.. . .In short, we conceptualise the medium of our internal representations by abstracting some features from the content, and attributing them to some kind of spiritual or ghostly substance. That is the best we can do, because actually we cannot experience the medium at all and have to look for analogies in the external world. The idea that the medium is some state of the brain seems intuitively absurd, so powerful is the illusion that we are dealing with an iconic representation in a medium of spirit.Personal correspondence, 3 May 2017 I argue that at worst, the second point claims that qualia doesn't exist and at best, it is an argument for panpsychism. First, on it's face, the assertion of the second point could not solve or eliminate the hard problem of consciousness because it it discusses a way to conceive of qualia rather than a mechanism for its existence. Regardless of what qualia is on some deeper level, it's existence as an experience is itself the hard problem of consciousness. Regardless of how that experience connects to anything else. Second, it is certainly not an *uncontested discovery of neuroscience* that \"there is no place in the system for qualia, if they are conceived of as intrinsic properties instantiated by (as contrasted with represented by) some activities in the nervous system.\" Is this simply a claim that the hard problem can never be solved? Or that emergentism is conclusively false? And what would it mean for qualia to be *represented by* the nervous system? Richard Power's letter doesn't offer much clarity, except that it clearly is not denying the existence of qualia in the absolute sense. It seems to simply claim that nothing needs to exist between the brain functions (the medium) and the content (qualia). While that is certainly a possibility, without an actual description of the mechanism for which qualia (content / experience) exists on the brain (material / medium) the hard problem remains. If this mechanism is purposely left out because it isn't necessary, two possibilities are left. First, the content of qualia is physically contained inside the brain. This would have to include manifested experiences. If I imagine a picture of a dinosaur, you could take a very powerful microscope and find a picture of a dinosaur on my brain. If I imagine the sound of dinosaur, you could take a very powerful microphone and record it. No translation device could be used because the content as experienced would have to be directly on the medium. The complication here is how do feelings (pleasure, pain) exist directly on a physical medium? Second, no mechanism is required because\\* consciousness in some form exists as a part of all matter. I find this to be the more reasonable of the two conclusions. I consider this a real possibility, however, I'm not sure that Dennett does...<Miramaxxxxxx>: In my understanding Dennett is not denying phenomenal experience per se, but he is rejecting a particular understanding of qualia (or subjective experience) that in spite of its popularity in some philosophical circles (qualia as ineffable, intrinsically private properties of experience) he finds unwarranted and irreconcilable with science. So, he certainly seems to be an eliminativist of qualia in *that* sense. In your analysis you seemingly overlooked this third option: \u201cqualia as ineffable, intrinsically private properties of experience simply do not exist\u201d. Instead of providing a mechanism for that which doesn\u2019t exist, Dennett should rather need to explain why so many talk and behave as if such qualia existed and warranted an explanation (Chalmers calls this the \u201cmeta-problem\u201d of consciousness), but then again that has always been part and parcel of Dennett\u2019s project.<EyeYouRis>: I have trouble understanding the concept that he isn't denying the experience but denying that they are \"ineffable, intrinsically private properties.\" Doesn't that leave the first option? That these experiences are completely and directly physical (what you imagine appears physically on your brain). I may be misunderstanding you, but I feel like this relates to the concept of experience being some sort of illusion. In which case I've never understood how that changes anything. Isn't the problem the experience itself?<Miramaxxxxxx>: The problem of \u201cexperience itself\u201d is the \u201chard problem of consciousness\u201d. The hard problem appears so hard, however, since it seems that we can intuitively imagine a world filled with all the functionality and behavior that is typically associated with consciousness, but without phenomenal qualia (or subjective experience). If that is true, then qualia could never even in principle be explained by any neutral \u201cthird-party account\u201d of standard science. But let\u2019s stipulate that this is all false. That it\u2019s a mistake to intuit that phenomenal experience has these private qualitative properties *in addition to* its behavioral or functional consequences. Then instead we would need an account of why it is that we have so many confused intuitions about our own experience (this is what Chalmers refers to as the \u201cmeta-problem of consciousness\u201d). The kicker is, that this kind of explanation, if it exists, seems to have to be a \u2018standard\u2019 functional/behavioural account. What\u2019s more, even those who are taken in by zombie-like arguments for qualia should agree that such an account is required, as long as they also insist that qualia cannot be part of any third-party account of behavior (after all p-zombies by definition also wonder about their (non-existing) subjective experience). That is the moment when Dennett turns around and insists that as soon as the meta-problem of consciousness is solved, we can pack up and go home, since all observable behavior has been sufficiently accounted for (of course nobody, including Dennett, thinks that such an account has been given already). Did this help?<EyeYouRis>: &gt;That it\u2019s a mistake to intuit that phenomenal experience has these private qualitative properties *in addition to* its behavioral or functional consequences. &amp;#x200B; I understand Dennett's interest now is in what follows, and while I think it's interesting, I can't really get past the part above. I don't understand what it means to concede that the phenomenal experiences exists that do not have private qualitative properties in a way that is consistent with physicalism. It seems like an odd form of dualism.<Miramaxxxxxx>: I cannot follow you, I am afraid. Maybe you misunderstood what I wrote? I am using phenomenal experience as a theory neutral term, as in: we clearly have some form of phenomenal experience, the question is what *kind* of phenomenal experience we have. Dennett is simply a functionalist, so he insists once all functionality has been accounted for, there is nothing left to play the role of ineffable, intrinsically private qualia. Where is the dualism in that?<EyeYouRis>: &gt;Dennett is simply a functionalist, so he insists once all functionality has been accounted for, there is nothing left to play the role of ineffable, intrinsically private qualia But if you're not denying the existence of experience, wouldn't the functionalist question be, what is their function? The dualism aspect I see is recognizing the existence of something while asserting it has no qualitative properties. It seems to suggest that something exists which is not physical. &amp;#x200B;<Miramaxxxxxx>: &gt; But if you're not denying the existence of experience, wouldn't the functionalist question be, what is their function? Sure. That\u2019s a different conversation though. The \u201cqualia-defender\u201d has already conceded (or never questioned) that there are functions of phenomenal experience (visual experience informs you about your environment, pain informs you about your inner state, etc.), but poses the challenge to explain why all this regular functioning is accompanied by ineffable, intrinsically private properties. There are several possible ways to respond to this challenge, Dennett\u2019s response is: \u201cThose ineffable, intrinsically private properties you talk about, do not actually exist.\u201d This is the context of the conversation on hand. &gt; The dualism aspect I see is recognizing the existence of something while asserting it has no qualitative properties. It seems to suggest that something exists which is not physical. \u200bI am sure that there has to be a misunderstanding with the terminology you are using. A full on eliminativist materialist typically rejects *all* mental properties and insists that the physical does not give rise to anything mental. This is as \u201cnon-dualist\u201d as it gets. Certainly then, rejecting some (ineffable, intrinsically private) mental properties pushes you away from dualism rather than towards it. Clearly, it\u2019s the one who is asserting that there are qualia, that - due to their character - are not amenable to functionalist or behavioralist analysis, who is \u2018flirting\u2019 with dualism, which also explains why so many philosophers who assert qualia are (property) dualists.<EyeYouRis>: &gt;\u201cThose ineffable, intrinsically private properties you talk about, do not actually exist.\u201d The difficulty I have is that if I understand him correctly, he goes out of his way to explain that he isn't denying the experience. So what aspect of it is he saying doesn't exist? Saying it is not ineffable or intrinsically private make it seem like he is saying the experience exists directly physically (again as if mental representations somehow exist observably on or within the brain). &gt;A full on eliminativist materialist typically rejects *all* mental properties and insists that the physical does not give rise to anything mental.

Right, but while simultaneously recognizing the existence of experience, without any kind of mechanistic explanation, makes it seem to me like there is something non-physical in this theory. &gt;Clearly, it\u2019s the one who is asserting that there are qualia, that - due to their character - are not amenable to functionalist or behavioralist analysis, who is \u2018flirting\u2019 with dualism... It seems that recognizing that experience occurs that the properties of don't \"really exist\" is pretty much the same thing. The operational part is that any experience occurs at all. &amp;#x200B;<Miramaxxxxxx>: &gt; The difficulty I have is that if I understand him correctly, he goes out of his way to explain that he isn't denying the experience. So what aspect of it is he saying doesn't exist? Well, the intrinsically private, ineffable aspect. He isn\u2018t denying that *some form of experience* takes place. He is denying that this experience is intrinsically private. &gt; Saying it is not ineffable or intrinsically private make it seem like he is saying the experience exists directly physically (again as if mental representations somehow exist observably on or within the brain). To me it only suggests that whatever phenomenal experiences are, they are not intrinsically private, nor ineffable. I would think it\u2018s not charitable to fill in the blanks with additional assumptions. &gt; Right, but while simultaneously recognizing the existence of experience, without any kind of mechanistic explanation, makes it seem to me like there is something non-physical in this theory. Dennett has has a positive account of consciousness (see his book \u201aConsciousness Explained\u2018) where he gives his best shot at explaining the phenomenon, but which many (maybe him included) find quite lacking. Yet, I do not think that this charge is damning in any respect. After all, nobody has a sufficient mechanistic account of consciousness yet (the easy problems aren\u2018t solved) and Dennett can easily accomodate any scientific insight that neuroscience and psychology produce. He is only committed to the position that \u201escience as usual\u201c is sufficient for explaining every aspect of consciousness worth explaining, so answering with: \u201eWell, then provide that mechanistic account!

My point was that the existence of any experience at all is not any less of a hard problem than an experience that is \"not intrinsically private, nor ineffable.\" The problem remains.

(Besides some sort of unmentioned panpsychism, which at this point I think is the most reasonable explanation consistent with his views.) I agree that he is eliminating a certain space for a theoretical explanation, but notice that he does so only because he thinks that the explanandum (qualia) doesn\u2019t actually exist. I am baffled how you can conclude that panpsychism \u201cis the most reasonable explanation consistent with [Dennett\u2019s] views\u201d. Dennett really makes no secret about his views: he is a functionalist about mental states and an eliminativist with respect to qualia. I don\u2019t mean to offend, but I would really urge you take the views a philosopher explicitly endorses seriously, instead of projecting your own interpretation. &gt; My point was that the existence of any experience at all is not any less of a hard problem than an experience that is \"not intrinsically private, nor ineffable.\" The problem remains. I think that this would need to be argued for, not just asserted. In my assessment, this would overturn the field quite considerably, as most leading philosophers of mind seem to have accepted that its qualia (or *subjective experience*, as Chalmers calls it) that is at the root of the hard problem, not experience or consciousness in general. <EyeYouRis>: &gt; I am not sure what you mean by \u201cphysical existence of mental representations\u201d, so I cannot really comment on that.

Dennett really makes no secret about his views: he is a functionalist about mental states and an eliminativist with respect to qualia. I see panpsychism to be the most consistent with eliminating the space for any other sort of other explanation but not denying the experience itself because it would be something intrinsic to the physical structure, a way of allowing for the claim that mental starts are identical to physical states because the physical states can account for the experience. &gt; I don\u2019t mean to offend, but I would really urge you take the views a philosopher explicitly endorses seriously, instead of projecting your own interpretation. Well, it's possible for the conclusions of people's arguments to be something beyond what they would explicitly endorse, and especially in philosophy, I don't think there is anything wrong with discussing that. &gt; I think that this would need to be argued for, not just asserted. In my assessment, this would overturn the field quite considerably, as most leading philosophers of mind seem to have accepted that its qualia (or subjective experience, as Chalmers calls it) that is at the root of the hard problem, not experience or consciousness in general. Well, qualia has a pretty varied definition but the root of the hard problem is that any experience exists at all, not any specific qualities or characteristics of that experience. <Miramaxxxxxx>: &gt; As if there was an observable screen in the brain somewhere you could directly observe imagined images. You think that the idea that there is something like \u201can observable screen in the brain somewhere you could directly observe imagined images\u201d is consistent with Dennett\u2019s views on consciousness? &gt; Well, it's possible for the conclusions of people's arguments to be something beyond what they would explicitly endorse, and especially in philosophy, I don't think there is anything wrong with discussing that. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s wrong to take the views of people to their logical conclusions. I am sorry if I gave you a different impression. I just think that it would be perplexing that a philosopher of the mind wouldn\u2019t have done so already. So the fact that Dennett comes to a completely different conclusion with respect to panpsychism should give you pause as to whether you understood his views correctly. Do you agree? &gt; Well, qualia has a pretty varied definition but the root of the hard problem is that any experience exists at all, not any specific qualities or characteristics of that experience. The philosophy of mind is full with messy definitions, that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to be careful when discussing the views of others. The kind of \u201cexperience\u201d that is at the root of the hard problem is the kind of experience that p-zombies do not have, agreed? So, if you think that p-zombies don\u2019t have *any* kind of experience, then of course, you can say that experience per se is at the root of the hard problem. If, on the other hand, one thinks, like Dennett, that p-zombies do have *some* kind of experiences, then Dennett is obviously not using the term \u201cexperience\u201d in the same way.", "num_messages": 14, "avg_score": 2.0}

The delayed choice quantum eraser only says that we do not understand quantum mechanics fully. To argue more is to engage in an argument from ignorance. Interpretations of quantum physics are still controversial, but judging by professional philosophers who study this, consciousness-as-fundamental as a solution to the measurement problem is not accepted as one. Further, panpsychism is impossible, as additional quantum numbers cannot be added to particles of the standard model without breaking it entirely. Since the standard model works, panpsychism doesn't.<NothingToDoubt92>: Thanks for your criticism, I appeal a lot to authority because although I have studied physics, I am not a physicist, and am not pretending to know the finest intricacies of quantum theory. I explicitly state this in my blog, but I want people to be open-minded to the fact that several brilliant physicists have agreed with these theories that many would consider \"mystical,\" or at least the premise that consciousness is fundamental, including many of quantum theory's eminent pioneers, i.e. Schrodinger, Planck, Bohm, Pauli, Wheeler, Wigner etc... However, I also believe that on an experiential level we can find out a lot more about the nature of reality than most people realized. It is mainly on this level why I believe the universe works this way, and there is a lot more to reality than we are being told. This includes \"out-of-body\" experience and delving into psi phenomena -- such as scientific remote viewing -- that I also believe has an abundance of evidence to its reality if you look for it. Not getting into quantum anomalies (entanglement, tunneling, observer effect, etc) these subjective experiences are unexplainable by the materialist model of reality, thus I very much believe we must push the paradigm to a model of reality based upon mind or intelligent information. You don't have to agree, and there are many that may scoff at me, but that's fine. I do not agree, however, that panpsychism is \"impossible.\" Panpsychism I believe is a view that is growing and increasingly pushed into the public consciousness. We must at least remain open to its possibly, as it could explain many of these anomalies and subjective experiences. Moreover, all subjective experience we have -- our very self awareness -- is within consciousness itself. I do not believe it to be an accumulation of dead objects that leads to this. Again, you don't have to agree, but to denounce something as impossible because it does not fit the current paradigm, the current model, is a stark fallacy. For example, the geocentric model of reality also worked for many calculations that were built to fit around it. We could perfectly calculate the positions of the stars in the sky that rotated around the Earth. How could this be wrong if the calculations worked? It was only later that the powers that be realized that the crazies were right, and we had to switch our perspective to truly advance science. There may be reason, after all, why the \"hard problem\" of consciousness may be the greatest outstanding obstacle in science today, and why through so many interpretations, anomalies of quantum physics still cannot be explained classically. The calculations work, but on a fundamental level it is still very much up for debate why exactly they work, hence Richard Feynman's infamous \"shut up and calculate!\" when questioned by colleagues. There are many out there who posit that the subjective observer must be brought into the equation in order for quantum mechanics to exhibit consistency and erase loopholes around deeper implications. In the words of Henry Stapp, \"in order to make quantum mechanics work, you've got to bring the human agent into the equation,\" or the Nobel Prize-winning Wigner: \"it was not possible to formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to the consciousness.\" This indeed makes sense if you concede that the act of \"observation\" implies consciousness, and looking at a few of these experiments (including the ones I posted at IONS), it would naturally explain them. Thanks for reading.<Vampyricon>: The problem is that you don't understand in what way panpsychism is impossible. I'm not saying that as hyperbole, injecting my own opinion. I'm saying it is impossible because it is incompatible with what we know about particle physics. For the individual consciousnesses in fundamental particles to create a larger consciousness, there must be some property that interacts in some way. This requires another quantum number. If there is another quantum number, the standard model's predictions would be different. Since observations match what we predict from the standard model without that extra quantum number, consciousness cannot be fundamental, i.e. panpsychism is false.<NothingToDoubt92>: Again you reply with faulty logic, and again I must contend that just because something is incompatible with our current model does not mean it is impossible. There's a reason there are still so many outstanding interpretations of quantum physics -- because on a fundamental level, it is still very much up for debate what exactly is going on in these experiments. There is a reason why there is still, after all these years, the \"measurement problem,\" questioning how or why the wave function is collapsed. In fact -- at least from my perspective -- all the experiments and anomalies that I've researched point to the idea that at least on the quantum level, reality is not actualized without an observer, \"it does not exist\" even, for the wave function never collapses. This is shown in experiments such as the ANU delayed choice, the 1999 Weizmann experiment, as well as the several experiments at IONS showing the importance of a 'subjective' observer, all mentioned in the article, yet conveniently ignored. Logically speaking, this may then imply that that there is something fundamental about the mind of a subjective observer, because \"my observations is my consciousness,\" as quantum cosmologist Andrei Linde puts it, and \" it presumes that consciousness may have some independent importance.\u201d Or maybe not, who knows, but at least show the humility to admit it is in the range of possibility. That's all I ask. Otherwise it is futile to argue. <Vampyricon>: &gt;In fact -- at least from my perspective -- all the experiments and anomalies that I've researched point to the idea that at least on the quantum level, reality is not actualized without an observer, \"it does not exist\" even, for the wave function never collapses. Or perhaps the many-worlds formalism is true, in which case observers are simply along for the ride, or the pilot wave formalism, where observers, again, aren't special. Those two have much more evidence going for them than interpretations where the observer is privileged, since, as anyone who takes a quantum mechanics course knows, an observation is simply an interaction. &gt;Or maybe not, who knows, but at least show the humility to admit it is in the range of possibility. That's all I ask. Otherwise it is futile to argue. I will admit something is in the range of possibility iff it is in the range of possibility. Panpsychism is not. Its inclusion would break the standard model, and since the standard model works, panpsychism is false.<NothingToDoubt92>: \"Its inclusion would break the standard model, and since the standard model works, panpsychism is false.\" Fair enough . . . it is futile to argue with this. You're entitled to your beliefs. I am actually a huge fan of the many-worlds interpretation. Hugh Everett was a pioneer in that he described macroscopic objects in quantum terms -- not deterring to this arbitrary divide between realities -- and even positing the universal wave function. The many-worlds interpretation in itself implies that the observer is fundamentally entangled with its environment, constantly decohering to an infinity of timelines. And you're suggesting that the observer isn't special? That's pretty special to me. Of course the reason why there are so many interpretations is because it is still unknown what an \"observer\" ultimately implies. But the many-worlds interpretation to me seems to lead to the presumption that the mind of an observer is entangled in some sense with the environment. The question is whether the observer is \"along for the ride\" on a random dice role of the universe, or whether at some level it is actually mind swaying the probabilities, influencing or attracting certain timelines over others. If the latter is true then setting an intention is like throwing an anchor across the multiverse. The idea of mind having an active role in the multiverse is supported by evidence I've posted in my blog, including the many experiments performed at IONS \u201csuggesting that von Neumann\u2019s psychophysical interaction may be better interpreted as an active rather than a passive form of observation.\u201d Now I know you won't read deeply into the implications of these experiments as they do not fit your worldview but again, you're entitled to your beliefs and I must again assert, your faulty logic. But thanks again for your criticism. <Vampyricon>: &gt;Fair enough . . . it is futile to argue with this. You're entitled to your beliefs. It is not merely my belief. It is a fact. If you continue to hold to panpsychism despite the impossibility of it, then I see no reason to continue this conversation. &gt;The many-worlds interpretation in itself implies that the observer is fundamentally entangled with its environment, constantly decohering to an infinity of timelines. And you're suggesting that the observer isn't special? That's pretty special to me. No. The observer is just a part of the environment. I don't see how turning the observer into just another quantum system that may be entangled with other quantum systems makes it special. &gt;Now I know you won't read deeply into the implications of these experiments as they do not fit your worldview but again, you're entitled to your beliefs and I must again assert, your faulty logic. Again, my beliefs are biased towards the facts. The facts state that panpsychism is impossible, given the successes of quantum field theory and the standard model. You may continue to hold faith in panpsychism despite these facts, in which case I will no longer respond, since you would have abandoned all reason.<NothingToDoubt92>: You realize that the standard model -- the Copenhagen interpretation, if that's what you're referring to -- needs to perform a lot of loopholes around deeper implications in order to make it work? For example it treats observers and measuring devices in outdated classical terms instead of systems of atomic constituents embedded into the quantum mechanical framework of our universe. This completely goes against what Hugh Everett believed, who knew we had to encapsulate everything into a universal wave function -- since you mentioned the many-worlds interpretation. It makes no sense to have different equations for different parts of reality, clinging on to this outdated classical worldview. The Copenhagen interpretation was an attempt for physicists to settle things and abandon inspection of deeper implications, because classical physics is of course practical. And yes, the calculations work, but on a fundamental level there is still this \"measurement problem.\" It is still largely up for debate what the hell is going on in these experiments, openly admitted by those physicists most well-versed in quantum theory, such as Richard Feynman. But if you'd prefer them to just \"shut up and calculate!\" not questioning this reality then fine, I'm not wired that way. If you'd actually look at these experiments such as the one I posted at ANU or the one at IONS you'd realize there's something more going on. At the very least you should agree with the physicists -- that despite calculations that work, we cannot explain this \"quantum weirdness\" on a more fundamental level. That's what I'm getting at. <Vampyricon>: &gt;You realize that the standard model -- the Copenhagen interpretation, if that's what you're referring to -- needs to perform a lot of loopholes around deeper implications in order to make it work? Oh, so you thought I was talking about the Copenhagen interpretation? No, I wasn't. I was speaking of the standard model of particle physics. The standard model of particle physics forbids panpsychism.<ratchild1>: I realise this isn't contextually appropriate and maybe even irrelevant-- but I have been researching about panpsychism and I haven't found much in the way of someone arguing it is impossible until just now. So I just wanted to ask you some questions if you can spare me the time. Why does panpsychism add a quantum number? Isn't one of the variations of pansychism that consciousness is information itself (or something to that effect, this makes it dualistic), rather than additional information, if I have that right why does that add an additional number ? By it being 'dualistic', or put another way consciousness is awareness of information not a form of information itself, why would it add anything to the process at all? I realise that this has problems, but the problem isn't impossibility due to adding numbers. To me pansychism could very well be our modern day dualistic vitalism, they don't account for the reduction of consciousness to non-fundamental interactions, etc but I haven't seen someone claim it is impossible until now. How would evolution converge on developing complex and ordered minds without mind being fundamentally attached to information? If mind is not information, why is there mind at all if information is all that is needed in order to model the world and survive? Seems oddly expensive to produce a private experience just for the hell of it. If not expensive, and consciousness arises from configuration of systems doesn't it still require understanding of what it is physically? Does it make sense in physical models that systems acting together in certain ways produce/are consciousnesses? I'm curious as to what physicists who conclude it as impossible suggest that consciousness actually is? Or what remains a possible reason/explanation for its existence? At what point would intuition, using these reasons, suggest an organism or system becomes conscious? If the consciousness can't be explained by the model isn't that reason to consider a problem with the model potentially? The only evidence of mind existing is experience you and I have, if we consider this to be reality then doesn't a model of reality need to account for it? What explanation for consciousness exists that doesn't break the model while at the same time affirming the existence of consciousness ? Could you link any papers or articles which put forth the argument it is impossible due to this number problem? Btw Im genuinely curious, I'm not sold on the idea of panpsychism, however I have considered it as a reasonable position to have so I would love to know why it isn't. <Vampyricon>: &gt;Why does pansychism add a quantum number? Isn't one of the variations of pansychism that consciousness is information itself (or something to that effect, this makes it dualistic maybebut still), rather than additional information, if I have that right why does that add an additional number ? First of all, information is physical. Solutions to Maxwell's demon show this fact. So we can't save panpsychism by saying that consciousness is information The reason for requiring another quantum number is because consciousness would be another property of a particle. After all, it would have to interact with the consciousnesses of other particles to give a greater consciousness if it were to explain how we get consciousness. Adding any other property to any standard model particle without breaking the standard model is extremely hard. Just ask Peter Higgs. &gt;How would evolution converge on developing complex and ordered minds without mind being fundamentally attached to information? If mind is not information, why is there mind at all if information is all that is needed in order to model the world and survive? Seems oddly expensive to produce a private experience just for the hell of it. I don't know. I'm not an evolutionary biologist nor a neuroscientist. And until someone can calculate just how much more expensive (or how much cheaper, who knows?) it is, I don't think one can claim that the cost to add a consciousness, if that even is what's happening, is too prohibitive to evolve. &gt;I'm curious as to what physicists who conclude it as impossible suggest that consciousness actually is? Or what remains a possible reason/explanation for its existence? At what point would intuition, using these reasons, suggest an organism or system becomes conscious? To a reductionist, the mind is what the brain does. Exactly how it does it, we don't know. You'd be better off asking a neuroscientist for answers. &gt;If the consciousness can't be explained by the model isn't that reason to consider a problem with the model potentially? The only evidence of mind existing is experience you and I have, if we consider this to be reality then doesn't a model of reality need to account for it? What explanation for consciousness exists that doesn't break the model while at the same time affirming the existence of consciousness ? No one tries to tackle all problems at once with one model. If the map is just as large as the territory, why would we need a map? One assumption I think you've made in the post (correct me if I'm wrong) is that consciousness is something fundamental, and that is something that I just don't accept, because dualism, panpsychism, and similar theories all run into problems with the standard model, and the standard model, at everyday energy scales and quite a bit beyond, is something we know is true. This is non-negotiable. Therefore, since all we know of consciousness is that it appears in brains, it seems logical that consciousness is what the brain does. Consciousness being an emergent property is compatible with what we know of the standard model. Are there any theories that affirm the existence of consciousness while being compatible with the standard model? Epiphenomenalism, perhaps, but it can be disproven if you take note of your own consciousness and say \"I am conscious\", since that would be an effect on matter.<ratchild1>: I don't assume it because I don't believe it to be true, I don't personally like to hold metaphysical positions about stuff I don't know about. But, my understanding of panpsychism is that it is a dualistic position that attempts to blur dualism with non-dualism somehow. As in some fundamental mentality exists. There is something it is like to be a photon, yadda yadda. To me claiming there is something it is like to be a photon is similar to claiming there is something it is like to be a human. There simply is no evidence that its true beyond intuitions. Its a bit unfair to neurologists to say, \"Yeah nah it ain't here, our photons only has thisssss much space for stuff before things don't make sense\", you can imagine that neurologists might think the same. Doesn't it turn out that thats exactly what neurologists are saying? \"Its not here\", \"We need to invent a way to investigate it\", or essentially dualism \"the system of brain IS the mind\". Its not real or our models need adjustment or its 'dualism' in that systems are minds. &gt;&gt;it seems logical that consciousness is what the brain does I just don't find this very satisfactory and see no reason to. Which means I can't really be satisfied with our models of reality to the point where I outright dismiss alternative thought. I can be very suspect of that idea but how I can reasonably choose from these options when most do not explain consciousnesses, and while the only ones that do are potentially vitalisms I don't know that. I'm not saying physics is wrong or whatever, but on the issue of consciousnesses I don't find myself agreeing with the vitalists or you -- surely I have to put some kind of unreasonable trust that science will chisel away at the problem like it always has and find a working sensible theory with evidence and simulations, based only on the history of it having done so in the past. I think I am way way way too tired to be talking about this so excuse me if my reply was insane. I just feel a bit conflicted when the only thing I truly am aware exists is not accounted for in our theories of reality, ((yet)). It at least points to something very deep, at least to me, to try to model our consciousnesses. The only thing I know for certain is I am something, this conscious experience. A model of reality should account for the only thing I can confirm to be true without much reason for suspicion, no? <Vampyricon>: The thing is that quantum field theory is a quantitative theory. It has specific numerical predictions based on the number of degrees of freedom and what they couple to. We can then go and measure the values of the quantities and compare them to the predictions. It turns out that they match the ones where panpsychism is not included. The standard model is only unfair to panpsychists because reality is unfair to panpsychists, and reality is the final arbiter. So tough luck. And it's not like neuroscientists have said that they can't fit consciousness into their models. The neural correlates of consciousness is an active field of research in neuroscience. &gt;surely I have to put some kind of unreasonable trust that science will chisel away at the problem like it always has and find a working sensible theory with evidence and simulations Is it unreasonable? It is the only process that has given us a verifiable understanding of the universe. I'd say that assuming science would fail at such an arbitrary hurdle is more unreasonable, or at the very least, no less unreasonable than assuming vitalism when everything we know says life is a result of biochemistry.<ratchild1>: &gt;&gt;is it unreasonable? What do you use to confirm the reality of science? Science? Is that not more or less the same as what other perspective-based creatures do? Science is an extension of mind is it not? That's sounds hokey but I think you know what I mean, our awareness is made out of models of reality using our brains, science is also a model of reality. It seems at least questionable that any model of reality that suggests it's beyond subjective does not include itself. Science perhaps is our most accurate and powerful measurement tool but it is the result of minds, it doesn't account for this which is a deeper issue for me than vitalism. Vitalism was a problem that required ability to measure reality , that was solved it, the question of what is conciousness is about the measuring the ones who measure *beyond* their mechanical makeup, it is a question about the reality of awareness itself. I think that evolutionary science and biological science can approximate it, but I'm not convinced they can understand it's properties and laws. So perhaps then it does become something for the quantum sciences to grapple with, and some of them try to and they fail. But none of that suggests that the scientific model of reality is accurate to reality itself, because reality itself is only known through a private mind. Basically I'm saying the problem that was vitalism and the problem that is conciousness is different, it's 'specialer', and people who claim extraordinary things such as dualism are justified until there is a working model of it's existence in a non-dualist way. As far as I'm aware most of the proposed ideas of how to study conciousnes either include a form of dualism or ignore conciousnes experience. A mirage is an illusion, but a mirage has physical properties and so to should mind unless it is a fundamental quality associated with information itself OR some other kind of half dualistic half non-dualistic process. So I'm neutral about people saying everything is mind or there is no mind or systems are minds because imply dualism !<Vampyricon>: &gt;Basically I'm saying the problem that was vitalism and the problem that is conciousness is different, it's 'specialer', and people who claim extraordinary things such as dualism are justified until there is a working model of it's existence in a non-dualist way. Actually, they're not. Dualists are faced with the interaction problem, and that dualistic consciousness would have to interact with electrons or quarks. That would again mess with the standard model's predictions (energy measured would be less than expected, weird non-standard model particles, etc.). The thing with a lot of these theories of philosophy of mind is that they contradict what we know is impossible based on science. Our knowledge of reality places constraints on what is possible, and dualism and panpsychism are ruled out. &gt;What do you use to confirm the reality of science? Science? Is that not more or less the same as what other perspective-based creatures do? &gt; &gt;Science is an extension of mind is it not? That's sounds hokey but I think you know what I mean, our awareness is made out of models of reality using our brains, science is also a model of reality. Science is a method to generate models of reality. It's not a model. If it consistently generates wrong answers, we modify it, or throw it away altogether. The models it generates places constraints on what's possible and what is not. The required evidence to declare the standard model of particle physics inaccurate where it is applicable, as panpsychism and dualism must do, must have a statistical significance of at least 5 standard deviations to be declared a discovery, as is standard in particle physics. We have seen no evidence of anything that deviates from the standard model. The problem with claiming the scientific method is capable of generating more and more accurate models of reality, yet fails in this one case, is that there is simply no evidence for it. There should be some information you have access to that I don't that raises this hypothesis to your attention but not mine. Ditto for non-reductionist theories of consciousness. If you do have such evidence that hasn't been brought up yet, do it.<ratchild1>: &gt;&gt;There should be some information you have access to that I don't that raises this hypothesis to your attention but not mine. Wouldn't that be my consciousness? Whatever my eyes tell me or scientific models tell me, that is the content of my experience. The model of reality proposed by my eyes is inaccurate for reasons to do with its inability to approximate truths about the universe, models of truth in science are attempts at accuracy in truths about the universe, the model of reality proposed by my eyes and physics is inaccurate because it does not account for my perception. It seems like it cannot do so. There is no evidence of me having consciousness nor you. Do you believe you have it? Do you believe that perception exists? Does a model of reality that doesn't include perception actually model uppercase bold **Reality**, not yet and there is no indication to believe it even can -- as all discoveries have been to do with content. Perhaps what I'm getting at is its impossible, if we consider what we are. We are detection and perception, our bodies evolved detection and perception abilities to measure reality *NOT* to measure perception. The scientific method is an extension of our measuring, not able to escape it (at least from what we know now). There is no reason to think we can measure what we were not made to measure and science is also within this limit. So, if we only had our models of reality tell us the truth, perception is imperceptible and therefore not content, therefore not real. The evidence for it is the lack of *reason* to think science is able to succeed in this case. It is not like vitalism in that sense, physical reality (cellular processes and so on) is content and is measurable, similarly consciousness is only measurable as content YET you *precieve* and I *precieve*. The only evidence it exists is that you experience it. The evidence for the inaccuracy of our models of realities is you. Evidence for a reality beyond content, again, is you. This is why I am not ready to throw away people philosophising about it as foolish, they might be just making shots in the dark but at least their philosophical guess-works affirm the one thing I know exists (perception) and doesn't ignore an actual reality. If you have mind, perception itself is realer than the models of the world, as they are all known to have accuracy issues whereas you do not have an accuracy issue in saying that you have mind. That is why I trust that it exists and that OUR models of reality are limited or incomplete as they do not yet (and might not be able to) account for what clearly IS a part of reality. <Vampyricon>: &gt;There is no evidence of me having consciousness nor you. Us talking about consciousness is evidence of us having consciousness. As long as consciousness has a causal effect, talking about consciousness would be one of the effects of consciousness.<ratchild1>: When our brains are investigated would we find this casual effect or would we find neurological systems communicating using computer transmitted photons with each other through devices? Us talking about consciousness is not an effect of it. You cannot confirm I have perception through any of your models of reality, you are only aware that I can discuss this topic with you and if you investigated my brain fully you would find that everything I do is a physical process. Indeed you could model everything about me saying \"I have awareness\" BUT the awareness. If not, at some point someone will have to quantify mind as physical which you see is absurd at the quantum level, but I am saying that absurdity isn't escaped by placing it elsewhere. Perhaps they will one day model this physical mind, but some accepted model is gonna get stirred up in the process, no? What makes you think its on the biological scale and not the quantum scale? Its absurd on both levels right now. Even then, it is curious just logically on the biological level. How would evolutionary processes access mind without it being reducible? To the biologist, seeing an apple is not an effect of consciousness it is a very physical process, to say otherwise is dismissive of their models-- we know that our brains utilise physical processes to deduce the physical world. <Vampyricon>: &gt;When our brains are investigated would we find this casual effect or would we find neurological systems communicating using computer transmitted photons with each other through devices? &gt; &gt;Us talking about consciousness is not an effect of it. So you are *a priori* excluding the possibility of consciousness being a result of physical processes.<ratchild1>: No I'm not but if it is then there are questions of scope which is why we are talking right now. What scope is consciousness at? You don't like it at the quantum level, fair enough. But no level seems to enjoy it currently other than philosophers and hippies, hence the open question about what it is. The logic of it on a biological scale is very curious. How would evolutionary processes access mind without it being reducible? Evolutionary processes access things minimally first but never stumble upon complexity. Manipulation of chemical processes for survival ---&gt; bit of photon detection to deduce positions of things ---&gt; the eye of an eagle. You do not evolve a machine that detects or utilises nothing until it suddenly 'clicks' together. This means that if mind is physical, the use of mind is reducible to something capable of making or accessing mind or proto-mind, perhaps mind is a frequency you can tune into with physical processes. All suggest smaller scale mind, or something strange. What else could it be? Perhaps mind is an environment of sorts -- information itself is mind, perhaps. The wings of an eagle for instance, are apparently irrational without air and gravity, much like red and blue seem irrational without an environment of mind. However, the wings of an eagle operate based on physical processes, whereas the mind would be on mental processes. If the brain were acting in a mindless environment it would not rationally need mind to process information, much like a bird wouldn't need wings to get around. So, to me mind is therefore irrational in a reality that does not have mind as a fundamental or distinct reality 'layer' in the same way wings are nonsensical without the fundamental laws of physics. This leads me to be open to the possibility that there is a fundamental law of mind. Which makes some panpsychist positions sane, if overly confident. <Vampyricon>: A lot of assumptions there. Neurobiology is currently researching consciousness, as I believe I've mentioned, so it's not that \"no level seems to enjoy it currently other than philosophers and hippies\". Another assumption is that mind is not reducible. You keep saying reducible to some sort of proto-mind but that is not reductionism. &gt;This means that if mind is physical, the use of mind is reducible to something capable of making or accessing mind or proto-mind, perhaps mind is a frequency you can tune into with physical processes. All suggest smaller scale mind, or something strange. What else could it be? Perhaps mind is an environment of sorts -- information itself is mind, perhaps. Define your terms. A frequency of what? If information is mind, then mind is physical.<ratchild1>: &gt;&gt;Another assumption Your being a bit unkind here, I did not just spout an assumption that no level enjoys it, my reasoning for that was made perfectly clear that irreducible emergence is not found in evolution. &gt;&gt;You keep saying reducible to some sort of proto-mind but that is not reductionism. I don't know what you mean, proto-mind to me is just awareness at a non-organism scale. &gt;&gt;Define your terms. A frequency of what? If information is mind, then mind is physical. Mind is physical, OK. What is red? A series of physical processes. \"It is not just that process it is red, the experience\" says a conscious person. We already know how to cause people to see red show them something that reflects certain light frequencies, next step is to directly influence their brains to force them to see red erroneously. Neither is research of mind in the sense I am speaking, consciousness *itself*. That is brain research. The experience of red, lets say, can be understood in terms of the brain, and physics -- however that understanding is physical NOT mental, know how a bat experiences sound via a full mapping of its brain is not the same as mentally experiencing batness. I don't know if its is possible to tell what sort of mind elements a bat is using, but even if we can tell what mind elements (experience of redness is a mind element lets say) is in use we will not experience it, hence mind to those who measure the physical is private. Do you not see the problem here? The dualistic approach that mind is physical information in the form mental information, the mental information is distinct as it is not *just* physical. Its an absurd answer to an absurd question and there is reason to think no good answer can result from physical sciences given what we know. Hence I am agnostic about it. &gt;&gt;Define your terms. A frequency of what? If information is mind, then mind is physical. A frequency of mind. And if mind and information are dual, then it is a frequency of information of some kind. Biological creatures do not utilise frequencies of electricity without electricity coming from fundamental physics. Same for mind, why would mind exist if it is not accessible to smaller scale lifeforms? <Vampyricon>: &gt;A frequency of mind. What frequency? What is vibrating?<ratchild1>: Not a clue, information, mind elements? I am merely suggesting a format by which mind could be understood, not that I think that it is a frequency, it was just an example of mind as a physical process or something. The meat of what I'm saying is not that (Hint: its all the stuff about consciousness and its private nature) and if you are hung up on mind frequencies, I concede that there is no frequency of mind. I take your lack of addressing my points as either you cannot be arsed, think I'm going in circles,or think I'm nuts or don't care enough to reply to my points. I mean, really? Was the takeaway from my reply my just the offhand remark about a hypothetical frequency of mind? What about all that stuff about the problem of private experiences and the evolutionary function of mind? :&lt;<Vampyricon>: I've been going at this for several days now and am frankly quite tired of the topic. I do think we are going in circles. My case is simple: Panpsychism requires another quantum number, which breaks the standard model, giving predictions contrary to what we observe. Therefore it cannot be true. Whatever consciousness is *must be compatible with the standard model*, otherwise it can be rejected outright because of the evidence for the standard model. To be honest, it isn't even much of a case. It's a fact. To reject this would be to reject the past 50 years of high energy physics. Now one can try to build a model with panpsychism that is compatible with the standard model. Then I would change my mind. But that model would require much more math than any proposals shown to me so far, and I dare say all proposals shown to me have simply been denials of the fact stated above, rather than an actual mathematical model.<ratchild1>: Thats okay.

The moment of choice where you\u2019re not attached to any existing moral system does not exist | Stanley Fish <them_russians>: Ok, so you pick pieces from all existing moral systems and construct your own from that. That's an original moral code. The enlightenment idea was that one shouldn't subscribe fully and wholly to, say, the Islamic moral system. Your claim is equivalent to saying a painter cannot create an original painting because he didn't begin by inventing new colors.<jsnforce>: I took from that statement that the choices you make in picking your moral code are being informed by other moral codes. For instance, you'd choose to reject Islam's treatment of women because it conflicts with your existing moral code on how women should be treated. <Edit>: I shouldn't post in philosophy. <them_russians>: Ok but is selecting an element for your moral code a moral decision? Genuinely asking what you think\u2014I think you raise a good point.<AProfoundSeparation>: I would argue that yes, choosing an element for your moral code would be a moral decision. You may try to rationalize such decisions with logic, and that logic may be sound, but you are still ultimately deciding based upon what you feel is morally correct.<yRegge>: Unless you choose something that you determine by logic to be the best choice, and it goes against what you feel. Or am I misunderstanding?<quicktehol>: The logic is a tool of the moral or value laden judgement. Logic is deciding how to do something. Morality/value is deciding what to do. Say I have a car. Some may say that it is logical to keep its water topped up. Which is true if i want the car to run well. That is if i want the car to last a long time as a device to take me places. But if I want to see the car break. If i want to see smoke come out from under the hood then it is not logical for me to keep its water topped up. Logic can never inform morality or value. All that morality really is is subjective preferences. That's all. Nothing more. And people who appeal to logic in order to justify morality are really trying to manipulate others into trying to make the world how they want it made. Much in the same way that religion seeks to establish the preferences of a group in the will of a fictional deity atheists seek to establish it in a skewed and hazy conception of reason. They are both nothing more than elaborate and sophisticated forms of crowd control. <Zunjine>: But I have logical reasons to value the continuing function of my car. If all of a sudden petrol engines were outlawed or I was given a new and better car I would value this less. Logic has therefore informed the value I place on a given thing. Logic has informed what I do, not just how I do it. Sorry, I don\u2019t think your argument works. <Aeonoris>: You can string together values with logic (I value a functioning car because I value being able to move long distances with ease), but that's not the same as using logic to create base values.<Zunjine>: What do you mean by \u201cbase values\u201d?<Aeonoris>: Values not derived from other values.<Zunjine>: I\u2019m not entirely clear still. Can you give me an example?<Aeonoris>: What are you not clear on, specifically? It seems straightforward. It's hard to give a universal example since different people value different things.<Zunjine>: If base values are values not based on other values then you should be able to state them without reference to anything personal to me. Why does it matter what I value? A base value isn\u2019t based on what I value so should stand alone. <Aeonoris>: I'm not saying that they're universal, I'm saying they're not based in logic. If you don't believe there exist base values, but you believe all values logically derive from other values, then isn't that circular?<Zunjine>: I\u2019m just trying to understand what a base value is. Can you give me an example of a value not based on or derived from another value? One from your life maybe?<Aeonoris>: Sure, I'll try: Being content. I don't value that particular feeling because I've reasoned myself into it, it's just something I value. Could you tell me what you consider to be the basis for your values, if it's circular?<Zunjine>: So you value being content for no reason other than that you value it? An effect without a cause? Are you sure you have no reason to value being content? It\u2019s just random? <Aeonoris>: Are you ignoring my questions by accident, or being intentionally rude?<Zunjine>: I\u2019m trying to get to the bottom of what base values are before moving on to a different question. It\u2019s very easy to get distracted with this kind of conversation with so many ideas to keep in mind. So far you\u2019ve said that logic can\u2019t lead to base values but the only example you\u2019ve given me seems entirely logical. Contentedness feels good. It\u2019s logical to prefer what feels good over what feels bad. So I\u2019m not sure how that differs from any other value. I\u2019m not sure yet that I accept the premise of your question and I think if we get to the bottom of what a base value is then that might help me answer it properly. <Aeonoris>: &gt; It\u2019s logical to prefer what feels good over what feels bad. You haven't established that, but the more important thing is that you don't prefer it *because* it's logical. Do you think that babies reason themselves into wanting their mothers' milk? If you don't accept the premise of my questions, then elucidate what your own stance is, rather than trying to get me to guess at it and then ignoring my incorrect guesses.<Zunjine>: I\u2019m simply saying that I don\u2019t see how that value is incompatible with logic, which I think is the argument here. <Aeonoris>: That's not something I argued at all, so I don't know where to go from here. I'm arguing that base values aren't based in logic, not that they're 'incompatible' with it. What do you even mean by that?<Zunjine>: So you assume that these values are not based on logic for what reason? If I have a whole bunch of values how can I distinguish the ones based on logic from those not based on logic? <Aeonoris>: Well, which ones did you arrive at by logic?<Zunjine>: All of them. This is a crude position and I\u2019m sure it needs refining but I think we begin with the ability to feel good or bad. We like what makes us feel good and dislike what makes us feel bad. This is biological. Then everything else grows from this starting point. Everything is derived that way through logic, either deliberately or unconsciously. Doesn\u2019t that seem intuitively true? If this is true then we can apply logical thought to understanding at a deeper level what it means to feel good and feel bad, what kinds of pleasure and pain are more important, and what we should do from a moral standpoint. <Aeonoris>: Your bit about feeling good vs bad being the basis of everything doesn't seem intuitively true to me (I value leaving the world a better place when I die, for example, even if it wouldn't 'feel good' to me in the end), but at least we've found common ground: You personally consider \"I feel good.\" to be a base value. We got there. <Zunjine>: So you\u2019re saying you\u2019d feel bad knowing you made the world a better place? <Edit>: I\u2019m not entirely sure I\u2019d call it a value to feel good mind you. More a state I\u2019m trying to achieve because my system demands it. Like breathing. <Aeonoris>: I didn't say I'd feel bad. I'd be dead, and there's no reason to think I would continue to exist. It's just something I value, despite the fact that the fulfillment of it isn't something I'll ever be able to experience. I value it anyway.<Zunjine>: But you experience it through your own internal narrative. You value it because it makes you feel good to act that way. I don\u2019t see how this goes against the basic drive to feel good. <Aeonoris>: I don't see why it would have to act against the basic drive to feel good to be something you value without being driving there by logic. <Zunjine>: If the basic drive is to fulfil whatever requirements your system has to feel good then anything we logically come to value must lean that way. That\u2019s my point. If we are just systems trying to feel good then all our moral choices are just logical extensions of that drive. <Aeonoris>: Even if I were to accept your 'all things are feeling good' premise, it doesn't follow that all values were arrived at via logic. Logic is just a specific method of inference. <Zunjine>: What other method do you use? <Aeonoris>: Why do you think people always use a method to arrive at values? <Edit>: Here, I'll give an example of what I'm talking about: - Jill and Tom trade some furniture with each other. - They do this without mathing out the specific market price of each piece of furniture - Later, Jill does the math - She finds out that given the extra effort it would have taken to find the piece she received, both parties made an economically reasonable trade Would you say that Jill and Tom arrived at the trade via math?<Zunjine>: You said logic is one method. That implies there are other methods. So I\u2019m curious what other methods you might use if you\u2019re not using logic. As an additional question, how do you decide which method to use? <Aeonoris>: Edited my post. Sorry if I implied that I was focusing on the fact that it's a method - I was intending to focus on the fact that logic is specific, and just because you find something sensible doesn't mean you arrived at it with logic specifically.<Zunjine>: Fair enough. It may not qualify as formal logic. We often arrive at decisions without formally considering the logic. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we need anything other than logic to arrive at our moral positions. That\u2019s where I think we started. Morality can be based entirely on logic. There\u2019s no moral position that cannot be arrived at via logical thought. <Aeonoris>: I think I could agree with you that we should strive to use logic, with whatever basics we can find that we share with fellow humans, to come to moral conclusions. I just don't think that those shared basics were necessarily arrived at logically, nor do I think that people always *do* use logic when figuring out their morality.<Zunjine>: That\u2019s a reasonable position. Much of what we call values and morality we adopt by default. <Aeonoris>: Thanks for the conversation! It's bed time for me.<Zunjine>: I enjoyed it.

It is more than just the spirit becoming that of the child, but also is an idea built very heavily on Nietzsche's concept of eternal recurrence and his understanding of suffering/modern ethical values. To become the \u00dcbermensch, the spirit must become the child in that it becomes a value creator rather than follower, but it also must be able to affirm life as a whole without appealing to a metaphysical Other. I think you've done a good job highlighting the basis of the metamorphoses, but I think the bits about eternal recurrence and suffering are absolutely crucial to understanding Nietzsche's concept of the \u00dcbermensch. Both would be worth a video of their own, I'd say.<cleepboywonder>: For some reason I'm a bit irritated by the stress put on by eternal recurance. I think of it more of a thought experiment as to illicit the response given from it. I don't think Nietzche believed in the metaphysical speculation of eternal recurance merely as a possibility that promotes certain action and from those we could see how we should act. This disposition mainly is because I've only seen eternal recurance show up like twice (four pages at most) in Zarathustra and The Gay Science.<balthazarbarnabus>: My point wasn\u2019t that he necessarily believed it to be a possibility but rather a useful mechanism. I\u2019ll try to be concise and give you an idea of my understanding. Zarathustra hopes to teach the \u00dcnermensch so mankind can overcome life negating attitudes. He sees this attitudes in modern morality, which has given various answers to the question \u201cwhy do I suffer?\u201d which Nietzsche sees as a fundamental problem for man. Regardless of what the answers have been, what they have in common is they negate life, either by being purely nihilistic (Wagner, the wisdom of Silenus, Buddhism) or appeal to a metaphysical Other (heaven). These attitudes negate life as they can\u2019t justify life in itself. Suffering, the problem we need an answer to, most basically comes down to the inability of the will to will backwards. This is Zarathustra\u2019s \u201cspirit of revenge\u201d where he says \u201cbecause there is suffering in those who will, inasmuch as they cannot will backwards, willing itself and all life were supposed to be - a punishment.\u201d Suffering is inevitable as a human by virtue of willing. In order to deal with that, one of two things need to be addressed. Either the will, or the inability to go backwards. Addressing the will would seem to require not willing, which renounces life just as before. This won\u2019t work, so the past must somehow be dealt with. Nietzsche accomplishes this, I think, through his idea of unity. His description of the Greatest Weight in The Gay Science illustrates this perfectly, as he noted explicitly negative parts of life. The point is to emphasize the unity of negative and positive, and the inherent necessity of one for the other. If you can affirm life in the face of your worst moments, you are fully committed to life. If we look to his metaphysics in The Birth of Tragedy, he sees the world as a unity of the Apollonian and Dionysian. The Dionysian is described as the destruction of the principium individuationis. Willing is what individuates person from person, so a collapse of that causes a recognition that suffering is shared in every person that wills. This allows one to affirm life at face value. The only reason I bring up the BoT point is I think it underscores how central suffering is to Nietzsche, as well as providing an early example of unity he sees as intrinsic to our world. Sorry for the rant and formatting (I\u2019m on mobile). I think what is really central to the metamorphoses is his understanding of suffering and how he sees that being overcome. And that is through an acceptance of life as a whole, which I think he is able to describe well through the idea of eternal recurrence. <Bacalacon>: hey you seem to have a lot of knowledge on nietzsche philosophy, if you had to recommend a good book to start to a novice level philosopher, which one would it be?<balthazarbarnabus>: If you\u2019re interested in Nietzsche, I think a good work of his to start with is On the Genealogy of Morals. It is three essays outlining his critique of Christianity and modern values. It was the first work of his I read, and I think it\u2019s fair to say it provides a very good outline of his understanding of/his problems with the world. For a more general place to start philosophy, you can\u2019t go wrong with Plato and Aristotle. They are the first philosophers I read (Plato\u2019s Republic, Symposium, Dialogues, and Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, Physics). I highly recommend reading all of the above with the aid of secondary sources. Even Stanford\u2019s online encyclopedia will help tremendously with understanding vague passages/ideas. Other than the Greeks, I am a huge fan of the existential movement starting with Kierkegaard (some argue Nietzsche can be considered the first existentialist, personally I am not sure). I think some very accessible authors would be Sartre (\u201cNo Exit), Camus (\u201cThe Stranger\u201d) or Dostoevsky (\u201cThe Grand Inquisitor\u201d, an excerpt from \u201cThe Brothers Karamozov\u201d). They are accessible in the sense that the sentences lack jargon and are fairly clear, but still require effort to pin down an understanding of the underlying ideas.

I believe we will see the effective fall of free speech within the next 5 years, if not sooner. Between social media censorship and ISP's new founded freedom to discriminate against any IP address they deem fit, we will no longer be able to question anything even remotely against corporate interest. Funny how now you can't report or hide advertisements on reddit. Funny how all these people speaking against PC culture and progressivism are suddenly banned from youtube, twitter, and facebook. Funny how a corporate lobbyist became the head of the FCC and made the death of net neutrality their first priority. Funny how google now hides the most relevant results of your search behind paid sponsors. All of mans efforts to develop and promote the concepts of reason and critical thought are quickly being thrown into the garbage under our new corporate overlords, and those actions are being defended by a generation of corporate apologists. They are like slaves who are born into slavery, and have no ability to desire something they never had. tl;dr: Can't ask questions if certain questions aren't allowed to be asked.<Hypersapien>: The great thing about the internet is that anyone can start up a new site or service. If the existing communication vectors get too restrictive, new ones will pop up that cater more to what people want, and they will become the popular ones.<Beoftw>: Right but if ISP's can control whether or not people can get to your site, let alone even find it, what difference does it make? You would have to advertise by physical mail if your local ISP decided your website was not in its best interest for people to know about. The argument of \"you can just go somewhere else\" doesn't stand when the space \"somewhere else\" exists is also controlled by a giant corporation who can legally censor you.<DEPOT25KAP>: A war fought on many fronts... <Beoftw>: We need to establish that giant corporations who are in control of the major means of communication are effectively governing bodies of power, and that all of our constitutional rights should protect us from their tyranny as well. We need to amend our constitutional right to free speech in a way that protects us from corporate run means of communication in a world where the only effective means of communication are corporate owned. We either need to regulate communication companies in a way that force them to acknowledge our rights, or amend our rights to protect us from them.<PuffaloPhil>: I'd just like to point out that we have a public postal service alongside private couriers. I don't see why we couldn't have a public many-to-many system of communication alongside private social media companies like Reddit and Facebook.<Beoftw>: I'm not sure. I mean, can we even count on public postal services for long? USPS is in bad shape financially and have been for years. And I can only imagine what kind of hell government ran internet service would be like.<PuffaloPhil>: Why do we expect that \"giant corporations who are in control of the major means of communication are effectively governing bodies of power\" are going to be any better than actual governing bodies? Once we've added regulations and forced them to be transparent and accountable to the public, aren't they basically a public institution? If we are cynical, why would we expect the government to be able to come up with the right set of rules for them to follow? Do we even really need the features that Facebook and Twitter offer? Haven't they built their products to be psychologically manipulative and addictive? Wouldn't it be better and far easier to start from basic principles of public many-to-many communication and build up from there, instead of taking a for-profit, advertising based business model and whittle it down to shape? Do we not all gain from having an accountable, public institution operating alongside private competitors?<pale_blue_dots>: What about a sort of decentralized journalistic outfit powered by distributed ledger technology (blockchain technology) as a compromise of sorts between the two? I can see that as a viable and potentially excellent possibility. <PuffaloPhil>: In my opinion distributed ledger technology is needlessly complicated. This is best illustrated by imagining a situation where we use distributed ledger technology for smart properties. Let's say I own a car. The title and the key to start the ignition are registered on a decentralized blockchain. I lose the private keys that prove I am the owner. Now what? Or I sell the car but there is a dispute that results in a court settlement that exists outside of the scope of owners according to the blockchain. Now what? Well, in both cases, we would have to have some external agent modify the blockchain to deal with, well, reality. In practice this would mean that the government would maintain a list of amended transactions. The pragmatic approach is to just have the government act as the source of truth, as they currently do with all sorts of other institutions, ranging from real estate property titles to copyright and patent registrations.<cronus97>: Or if someone is liable for digital assets they pay the value just like any other court ordered operation? Nothing stops people from just not paying fines in the first place if the Justice system slacks on its job. Giving the government complete power over our currency stores is a bad idea, and counterintuitive to the concept of individual responsibility. Government does not, and should never, resimble the highest authority of truth. That authority lies with the individuals that live live underneath it's authority. <PuffaloPhil>: I think we're talking about two completely different things here. When I mean \"source of truth\" I mean it in the way that the county clerk's office is the \"source of truth\" on who owns what property. It doesn't make sense to have competing agencies that manage real estate property deeds. Distributed ledgers are also a \"source of truth\". There are practical applications but so far they seem mainly with facilitating black market transactions. Maybe this is a good thing. Maybe it isn't. I'm not interested in this part of the conversation. What I am interested in are things that are perfectly legal and perfectly transparent, like a many-to-many system for public communication, and one that is not guided by the machinations of for-profit corporations like Facebook and Twitter. For these things we don't need a distributed ledger. We just need a ledger, like how the county clerks office manages a number of ledgers.<cronus97>: Ah, you mean a source of verifiable truth we can derive further answers from? <PuffaloPhil>: That's a pretty abstract definition, but sure, why not? A single big ledger with dates, names and prices of real estate transactions is a source of truth for who owns what properties in a given area. If there were two or more competing ledgers then we can safely say that neither is a source of verifiable truth for who owns a given plot of land because they could easily be contradictory. If we're sticking with some basic rules of logic, truthful statements are by definition not contradictory. In this analogy we could consider future real estate transactions to be a form of deriving further answers to questions about who owns what land.<cronus97>: Hmmm, warmer. But contradicting statements can both be truthful given the proper perspective. The question that might be worth asking after we see the conflict is, Why? Abstraction is one of the most powerful conflict resolution tools we have. It's one of the most complex high level communication we can use person to person. <PuffaloPhil>: I'll excuse your patronizing tone if you excuse mine: If you approach these kinds of rhetorical traps as a fun little game to play then there is probably very little harm. However, because you want to play a fun little game with words, you're pulling this conversation very far from the original discussion around how information flowing through a society can affect politics. Maybe you don't think there are some pressing issues with the relationship between social media and our democratic republican institutions, but I do, and frankly, that's the only conversation I want to be having. It is fine for you to waste your own time but personally I'd rather be playing Magic: The Gathering or my guitar.<cronus97>: That's the beauty of Abstraction. You can say whatever you want about me or who I am. In the end I turn my phone off or delete my account and I can choose not to interact with you. Other people don't get that choice in their life. My purpose is to build a world where those people do have that choice. Life can be free and beautiful. It can be a wonderful creation. In the end it's about what you value and choose to act on. If you agree with my conclusion about building the world you want to live in while respecting the individual right of choice others should likely have then we are on the same side fighting a common enemy. End of that story. You do you and I will do me. Don't take the freedom of choice away from someone without good reason. <cronus97>: Just adding on* Don't let anyone tell you what your reality has to be. In the end it's your call to make choices given the information you take in. Even if you came to my home and put a bullet in my head that seemingly abstract thought of choice holds true. Philosophy tries to define choice, but in our attempt to describe it we also lose meaning. Any concept you explore gains detail, but the further in you go the easier to lose track of where you began. Until you start coming full circle in on yourself. Life without purpose is seemingly dead. Purpose without life is seemingly dead. This is not a game. But it is a game. It is war.

This blog post is no exception, and its reading of Descartes is simplistic to the point of being misleading. In the end, you ask yourself why Descartes is considered important in the first place! There are three major problems in this blog post. Firstly, the author forgets to mention that Cartesian doubt is insincere. It is *pretend-doubt*. Secondly, the author emphasizes the role of God in Descartes' writing at the expense of the real contribution, which is the core role given to an individual person's *common sense*. Thirdly, the author fails to consider the context in which Descartes is writing, both philosophical (scholasticism) and cultural (the Catholic Inquisition). What's Cartesian doubt about? Descartes does not actually reject all his beliefs - rather, he pretends to do so, for the purpose of discovering something that is known for certain. The pretend-disbelief used in Cartesian doubt can be compared to the pretend-belief used in a proof by the absurd. In a proof by the absurd, we pretend to believe A, in order to later discover a contradiction which serves to prove not-A. In Cartesian doubt, we pretend to not believe anything, until we find something that we can't disbelieve without contradiction -- namely, our existence. So Descartes is not saying that uncertain knowledge is worthless; he is however adopting a method which seeks certainty by pretending to completely reject anything uncertain. What's the point of all this, if all we get is existence? To understand Descartes' project, you need to begin with *common sense*. Descartes believed in the validity of our most direct *intuitions,* when they are at their most minute, at their most fundamental, when they are untainted by tradition, or illusion, or haste. (This is not exactly the same as a belief in logic or mathematics, because Descartes considers these disciplines to be methods of exposition, rather than methods of discovery.) For Descartes, we all have common sense, whether we're fast or slow; clever or stupid, ignorant or knowledgeable, we can all grasp the truth of things, if only we were to go about it in a slow and methodical way, as opposed to jumping to conclusions which we haven't carefully examined. In presenting this conception of knowledge, this intimately personal path towards truth, Descartes is challenging centuries of scholastic and theological tradition. The scholastic tradition seeks to improve human knowledge by (more or less) taking for granted the sum of past knowledge, and adding to it by a process of interpretation and exegesis. Thus while Descartes ultimately does need to bring in God to continue his project and bring it to bear on practical matters such as medicine, at the foundation of Descartes argument is not belief in God, but the assumption that we possess *common sense*. In Descartes, the (multiple, and all of them absolutely terrible) proofs of the existence of God are themselves derivative, secondary. The foundation is common sense. Therefore, when this blog post claims that: &gt;*We have three principal options: 1) adopt a position of radical skepticism and admit that nothing can be known with any degree of certainty, 2) prove the existence of God a priori and use God\u2019s perfection and goodness as a foundation for truth (Descartes\u2019 preference), or 3) recognize that the mind arises out of the activity of the brain and that, while imperfect, the brain, as an evolutionary adaptation, provides a fairly accurate (but flawed) representation of the world by which we can attain knowledge with varying degrees of certainty* This misrepresents Descartes' contribution, in which truth has, at its core and foundation, an *individual* using their *common sense*. Descartes rushes to prove God's existence after that, because he probably genuinely believed in it. But also because *he does not have a choice*. If Descartes had been any more clear about the non-theistic foundation of his philosophy, he would have been in real trouble -- indeed, Descartes was a contemporary of Galileo (condemned in 1633 by the Catholic Inquisition). In 1643, Descartes was accused of atheism and had to flee Utrecht, and to ask for the assistance of the French ambassador to the Netherlands to preserve his safety. Can we really ignore this when considering the *Meditations*? Consider now the proposal that is made here. The evolutionary approach is a \"virtuous circle\" in which evolutionary explanation is proven by our common sense, and in turn it justifies the validity our common sense. In Descartes, the assumption that common sense works is just that -- an assumption, one that we accept, perhaps, because we don't really have a choice in the matter (Descartes justifies the assumption essentially with a joke: *\"Common sense is the most fairly distributed thing in the world, for each one thinks he is so well-endowed with it that even those who are hardest to satisfy in all other matters are not in the habit of desiring more of it than they already have\"*). And this seems to me still a more penetrating account than the circular one presented here.<jam_boreeee>: You nailed it. I had to read his works multiple times to finally understand. It didn\u2019t help I read Nietzshce beforehand.<COUNTERFEITFOOD>: What do you reckon Nietzsche blocked you up on in understanding? I did read descartes before Nietzsche. In \"On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense\" Nietzsche has a bit about a leaf that I find illuminating and confusing. As I write this I think I'd say they both agree on this idea of a leaf yet they disagree over their suspicion of certainty and why we also ought to be suspicious of people who are certain with their claims <khlnmrgn>: Personally, I feel like the biggest contribution to my understanding of Descartes came from Heidegger's writings on Nietzsche (specifically volumes 3-4). Heidegger goes into great depth discussing the ways in which Descartes broke from classical philosophy, and the way that this transformation paved the way for philosophers such as Nietzsche. Heidegger claims, among a million other things, that Descartes' epistemology was revolutionary in that it a) re-conceived truth as \"certainty\" and b) relocated the metaphysical grounding of philosophy to the inner world of man himself (as opposed to God or the \"external\" Platonic forms) Very interesting read. The writing can come off as very obfuscated tho. <COUNTERFEITFOOD>: A political interpretation I was offered: Descartes argued science could continue without threat to religion because science deals with exteriors. And if knowledge is exteriors, the best we have is geometry. I think Plato wrote something about that above the entrance to his academy. <khlnmrgn>: Descartes was definitely concerned with the reconciliation of science and religion. Empirical science was beginning to have a huge impact on Europe and descartes was very much aware of the potential conflicts. An equally large influence was the protestant reformation (descartes himself fought in the 30 years war). Protestantism relocated the medium of divine communion from the institutions of the Catholic church to the \"inner light\" of individual moral conscience. Similarly, descartes relocated the metaphysical ground of philosophy from the \"external\" realm of forms to the \"inner light\" of individual, private rationality. Descartes was living in a world which was becoming increasingly fragmented, confusing and tumultuous in comparison to the relative metaphysical homogeneity of medieval europe, when virtually all aspects of human life fell into the framework of Catholic christendom. With the rise of protestantism and the advent of empirical science (not to mention the age of exploration which brought Europe into contact with foreign cultures in a way like never before), the western world was quickly losing its firm grounding. Descartes solution was to introduce a new grounding which was intended to be so \"inner\" that it presupposed nothing more than self aware thought. It was to be a starting point from which, theoretically, anyone could begin (protestants, catholics, scientists, whoever). And thus, theoretically, anyone would come to the same conclusions about human rationality, morality, god, etc... bc they all began from the same starting point; cogito ergo sum", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 212.7142857143}

Even if we were to take these characters as real, the supporting evidence he gives is thin at best, of which his strongest case is: &gt; She begins by asking Yajnavalkya (often described as her husband, but better thought of as her philosophical companion) a basic existential question of human beings: \u2018If I were to possess the entire world filled with wealth, would it make me immortal?\u2019 When he denies this, Maitreyi asks rhetorically: \u2018What is the point in getting something that will not make me immortal?\u2019 With that, the first foundation stone for the investigation of the relationship of knowledge to materialism is laid. He changes his thesis criteria here, by saying the \"first foundation stone for the investigation of\", when his original claim she said \"founded\". There's a big difference between helping to start a school of thought and building it all yourself; Aristotle is considered one of the greatest humans to have ever lived because he built multiple \"houses\", not \"laid multiple foundation stones\". These women did not found any school of thought, let alone philosophy itself; they, if they actually existed, are small contributors. The next example he gives is Akka Mahadevi, an Indian female poet from the 12th century, whom she claims \"founded philosophy\" by being part of the Virasaiva movement, but gives no examples of what her philosophical contributions were or anything she personally said at all (in fact, the only quote given is one that is said *to* her). He then attempts to support this example by defending Akka's historical profession as a poet, stating Aquinas wasn't a philosopher, but a priest, and neither was Augustine, as he was a bishop. He is being intellectually dishonest here and is moving the goal-posts of his claim as, 1.) he is supposed to be providing evidence that these women *founded* philosophy in some manner and 2.) for both Aquinas and Augustine we have multiple philosophical works *and* engagements with philosophers of their time (of which we have neither for Akka). Instead, he is trying to establish Akka as a \"philosopher\" by equating her to Aquinas and Augustine on a flimsy, linguistic technicality. There's also the matter of time, as Akka was born around 1130 CE, a full 1452 years after Aristotle's death. If you're going to try and make claims about \"founding philosophy\", you're going to need find examples just a bit earlier than that one. The author then moves his purview to Ancient China, and points to a quote from the *Tao Te Ching* (written by Laozi, a male): &gt; \u2018The feminine always conquers the masculine by stillness.\u2019 and claims this was \"important to Chinese philosophy\", but does not expand of how it was. In a similar manner, he takes a quote from the *Discourses of the States* (which is believed to be bibliographic statements), but does not connect it back to his original claim: &gt; In Discourses of the States (4th century BCE), Jing is quoted in an argument against indolence: \u2018When people toil, they think; when they think, their good minds are born.\u2019 No wonder Confucius says of her: \u2018The woman of the Gongfu clan is wise!\u2019 Jing is never described as a philosopher, simply \"wise\", and that's why her remark is more of an adage than a philosophical claim. The author then moves on to Ban Zhao and this is where his intellectual dishonesty becomes apparent and, quite frankly, insulting to both the reader and Ban Zhao. Ban Zhao is very famous ancient Chinese historian, whom I remember first reading about in high school more than a decade ago, as her works on geography and literature are quite crucial to our understanding of Ancient China. However, she is not a philosopher, and the author attempts to paint her as such by pointing to Zhao's *Lessons for Women*, where the author claims Zhao argues to teach boys and girls equally in reading and writing. However, Zhao never claims that in her work, in fact, there is [nothing in the text](https://china.usc.edu/lessons-women-ban-zhao-pan-chao-ca-45-116) remotely close to such a claim. It is essentially a marriage-prep manual, that discusses the virtues a wife should posses, how she should interact with her husband and society, and what makes a \"woman\". In actuality, it is a work feminists would label as \"sexist\" as it supports the propagation of gender roles; it is far cry from the author's original implication of feminist advocacy. After that big mistake, it becomes clear what the author is trying to do in this article: he is making a claim of women \"founding\" philosophy, and then supporting it with various, prominent women from history and \"pro-female\" sentiments. His examples get worse as the articles goes on, as most of them aren't philosophers, don't deal with the subject of philosophy at all, and towards the end of the article his topic changes completely to race &amp; racism, and then switching back with his closing statement: &gt; Philosophy was once a woman\u2019s world. It is time to reclaim some of that lost realm. There is nothing to \"reclaim\" here, this is not a territorial war; stop pitting the genders against one another.<FluxSurface>: I don't quite agree with your summary of the article. Some of your characterizations of Indian literature are not very correct. And I'll limit my reply to just the Indian part. First, you could use the same arguments to establish that even the men of the discourse of these works didn't exist. A lot of the historicity of these things is just the study of these literatures, as there doesn't really exist a source independent of the literature. And I don't think \"founding philosophy\" in this sense means the first person who did philosophy. By that standard, even Plato and Socrates could be questioned as the \"founders\" of philosophy. I think the term is used to mean founding a particular school of philosophy. This is somewhat clear from the Ubhaya Bharti example. Also to the claim that they didn't found schools of thought, there are many schools of thought that are just integrated through the commentaries on them, as the original works have been lost. The traditional way of debate within these schools was to incorporate them as characters in a discourse and then debate a version of their argument. Therefore, if a character with a viewpoint exists, there almost certainly existed a school of it. And the character usually represents the main figure who established the school. And coming to the point that some people were not philosophers at all, it would be easy to formulate a definition of philosophy that excludes these people, which you'll find also excludes a lot of accepted western philosophers. The boundary between philosophy and popular thought has never been clear cut in history, but I do accept that it is a bit clearer today. And I think you're extrapolating a bit too much to claim this article as a weapon of some possible gender war. <HugsAndFlowers>: DancingWithTheNight's defense of the white male philopatriarchy is ironically EXACTLY what the author is talking about; their attitude. Women and Black Men founded philosophy so Her essay goes against the typical problematic white male belief that other white males had anything to add to what is objectively a Woman's and Black Man's science. Philosophy has been COLONIZED by white males. They started this war against Women and Black Men so it's time to \"reclaim\" (as the author put it) what was once colonized!<Bigwooddeck>: How is philosophy objectively a woman's and black man's science?<HugsAndFlowers>: Your attitude is exactly what the essay author is talking about it. Ask yourself: why do you feel the desire to defend white male philosophy right now? You've been societized to think your way!<Bigwooddeck>: I don't want to believe nonsense about history, and what you're claiming is different than the usual view of the history of philosophy. I'd want to see some evidence before changing my mind, so I don't end up believing some nonsense fake history. <HugsAndFlowers>: Again, you are subscribing to a white male worldview. Do you really not see an issue with that? Do you really not see a problem with you defending white males?<Bigwooddeck>: Insofar as defending historical accuracy amounts to defending white males, I don't see the problem. We shouldn't sacrifice a fact based view of history in the quest for equity. <HugsAndFlowers>: Why do you feel the need to say that?<Bigwooddeck>: You asked.", "num_messages": 11, "avg_score": 3.0909090909}

I don't necessarily disagree with the conclusion - I just think it's a bit narrow and oddly self-contradictory. I'd say that it's not really that centrism is the best a priori political philosophy, but that skepticism, and more precisely pyrrhonism, is the best approach to all such things, including but by no means limited to political philosophy. \"Centrism,\" to me, is a structure - not a foundation. Pyrrhonism is a foundation. Starting from that foundation might well lead to building a structure that might reasonably be called \"centrism,\" so they sort of overlap, but they're not the same thing. And since \"centrism\" is more of a structure than a foundation, it can be, and often is, simply adopted and slapped in place, like any other ideological label. And that means that it can be, and as far as I've seen often is, built on a weak or faulty foundation. So in a sense, it can actually be an expression of a thing that you specifically criticized - foolish consistency. Instead of being an ex post facto generalization of the positions held by a person who's started from a foundation of healthy skepticism and open-mindedness, it can be, and often is, a mere contrivance or affectation, little different epistemologically from any other dogmatically held ideological position. So I get where you're going here and I do broadly agree (very much so, in fact), but I think to really make the point, it's necessary to dig all the way down to the foundations of political views rather than just the positions people claim. <DNakedTortoise>: Great points. A little constructive criticism maybe... reading top down I had a hard time understanding you. I ended having to read it backwards, with the paragraphs in reverse order. Maybe put the more detailed explanation earlier, and the broad, lingo heavy, summary at the end. Personally that made it much easier for me to take in. <BobCrosswise>: Thanks for the response and the criticism - it's something I'm aware of, but I apparently need to be reminded. Probably often. Sometimes I write a response just as you say, but it requires another rewrite (and I already rewrite too much as it is), so it's rare. The thing is that when I write about philosophy, my primary goal is most often to order and test my thoughts. Generally, when I start, I really don't know where I'm going, other than generally. I have some broad idea(s) that inspire me to write a response - some opinion regarding the thing I've read or some related thing that came to me in reading it or just in seeing the topic - but I haven't yet traced the line of reasoning that (presumably) leads to it. That's what I do as I'm writing. It forces me to explicitly consider each link in the reasoning. And since I'm writing for an audience, and generally one with a differing view, I have to explore and test each link along the way and look for flaws, presuming that if I don't find them, somebody else will. So the process is to write and re-read and rewrite until I build some sort of solid structure, or until I decide that there isn't going to be one and give up on the whole thing. I not only tend to start out with a broad, lingo-heavy summary - I often end up with a TL:DR, since it's only at the end, when I get everything straight in my mind, that I figure out some simpler way to express it. But by then, I'm generally tired of writing. And on a pertinent side note, I just scrolled back up to the top of this and added the first graph and rewrote the second. But I'm going to just let it go at that. ;)", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 2.25}

It\u2019s time to reclaim that lost realm. **I**rise to challenge you, Yajnavalkya, with two questions, much as a fierce warrior \u2026 stringing his unstrung bow and taking two deadly arrows in his hand, would rise to challenge an enemy. Give me answers to them!\u2019 With these daring words, Gargi Vachaknavi, a Vedic female sage, launched into philosophical debate with Yajnavalkya, the semi-legendary philosopher king and the greatest sage of his day. She repeatedly confronts him with existential questions about the fundamental ontology of the world: what is it that holds the Universe together? Yajnavalkya eventually proclaims it to be \u2018the imperishable \\[and\\] on this very imperishable, Gargi, space is woven back and forth\u2019. Vachaknavi is satisfied, and she declares to the other Brahmins: \u2018You should consider yourself lucky if you escape from this man by merely paying him your respects. None of you will ever defeat him in a philosophical debate. The story of Vachaknavi\u2019s debate is from chapter three of the oldest of the *Upanishads*, the B\u1e5bihadara\u1e47yaka, a diverse and complex Sanskrit text on metaphysics and ethics from about 700 BCE. Vachaknavi is one of the many \u2018hidden figures\u2019 of women in the history of philosophy in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America \u2014 what is often called the Global South. Philosophers today increasingly [recognise](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/women-philosophers-of-the-seventeenth-century/B048AF3DD6FA26DF2C85E4BEC553DBEC) the contributions that female philosophers have made to the history of European philosophy, such as Elisabeth of Bohemia, Margaret Cavendish and Anne Conway in the 17th century. (Indeed, the new Oxford University Press [series](https://www.oxford-new-histories.com/) *Oxford New Histories of Philosophy* might revolutionise how we look upon the history of philosophy.) But beyond Europe, female philosophers in general continue to get short shrift, and their contributions go largely unrecognised. Vachaknavi is not the only female thinker that helped to shape the world\u2019s oldest philosophy. Already in chapter two of the *Upanishad*, it is a woman, Maitreyi, who launches a discussion on the importance of one\u2019s self (*atman*) to gain \u2018the knowledge of this whole world\u2019. She begins by asking Yajnavalkya (often described as her husband, but better thought of as her philosophical companion) a basic existential question of human beings: \u2018If I were to possess the entire world filled with wealth, would it make me immortal?\u2019 When he denies this, Maitreyi asks rhetorically: \u2018What is the point in getting something that will not make me immortal?\u2019 With that, the first foundation stone for the investigation of the relationship of knowledge to materialism is laid. And then there is Sulabha, an ascetic Yogic wanderer, who wins a lengthy philosophical debate against the philosopher king Janaka in the epic *Mahabharata* (4th century BCE-4th century CE). The king goes quiet after Sulabha sets the record straight: \u2018My body is different from yours. But my soul is not different from your soul.\u2019 Indian male philosophers relied on their female counterparts throughout the centuries. The most famous classical Indian philosopher is perhaps Adi Shankara (788\u2013820 CE), who formed the monistic school of Advaita Vedanta, a vital part of Hinduism that bases its arguments on the *Upanishads*. In biographies of him, we read how Shankara engaged in a competitive philosophical debate with Mandana Mishra of the rival school of Mimamsa, which uses only the four early Vedas. The verdict of the debate came from Ubhaya Bharati, Mishra\u2019s wife. She, perhaps surprisingly, judged Shankara to be the champion, which had the unusual consequence of compelling her husband to submit to Shankara\u2019s philosophical school. But then Bharati addresses Shankara: \u2018You cannot claim complete success over my husband until I, his better half, have been defeated by you. Though you are an embodiment of divinity, I have a desire to debate with you.\u2019 Shankara obeys. They debated the Vedas and the different philosophical schools for 17 days. Bharati could not beat him, but then she struck on the idea of questioning him on the *Kama Sutra*, the science and art of love, knowing that Shankara had been a celibate from boyhood. Shankara accepted the challenge, but requested a month-long break to the discussion so that he could study these corporeal matters to perfection. He was successful, Bharati concludes, in the manner of Vachaknavi from the *Upanishads*: &gt;*You took all the trouble to master the science of sex just to conform to the ways of the world. That we have met with defeat at your hands is not a matter of shame for us, just like moon and stars do not go into disrepute when the sun suppresses their light.* After the debate, Ubhaya Bharati reportedly founded her own influential school of thought. **A**kka Mahadevi (*c*1130\u201360 CE) is another significant female Indian thinker. She was born in the town of Udutadi, in Karnataka, southwest India, and belonged to the Virasaiva movement, which argued for female equality, and opposed all that divides humankind, be it caste, sex, language or dress. Her radical philosophy confronted all priests, and perhaps still provokes today: \u2018All the Vedas, scriptures and sacred lore, canons and codes, are but grist and husk ground in the mill.\u2019 Mahadevi lived up to her own words by being a self-sufficient woman, choosing her own path and her devotion to Shiva rather than following the norms of scriptures, family or society. As a young woman, she married the local king Kaushika under the condition they kept separate bedrooms and she could spend her time as she pleased. When he broke his promise, Mahadevi took off all her clothes and walked freely into the streets, covered only by her long hair. The naked Mahadevi eventually arrived at Anubhava Mantapa, the centre of contemporary philosophical discussion. There she was confronted by the mystic and poet Allama Prabhu, who was understandably skeptical of this bare peripatetic. So they engaged in a philosophical and spiritual dialogue, during which Mahadevi convinced Prabhu of her spiritual worth (and uttered the imperishable line: \u2018Take these husbands who die, decay, and feed them to your kitchen fires\u2019). She was allowed into Prabhu\u2019s inner circle, and seems to have ended her days as a widely revered poet and spiritual thinker. Some would argue that Mahadevi is not a philosopher at all, that she is operating at, or outside of, the boundary of the discipline. But the Western \u2018canon\u2019 of today is, in the first place, based upon many such borderline figures who were not philosophers *per se.* Augustine of Hippo, for instance, was a bishop, Church Father and a Christian saint. Another canonised Western philosopher is Saint Thomas Aquinas, the Catholic priest, monk and Doctor of the Church. All the women mentioned here are less dogmatic, philosophically speaking, than either Augustine or Aquinas. Finding the boundaries of philosophy is a philosophical question itself: I would submit that any emerging \u2018global canon\u2019 of philosophy would do well to include the contributions of the women mentioned here. &amp;#x200B;<oliverlikes>: Women were also vital to early Chinese philosophy. In the classic *Tao Te Ching,*Laozi (6th century BCE) argues that a great state is like a clever woman: \u2018The feminine always conquers the masculine by stillness.\u2019 In a similar manner, the basic texts of Confucianism stress the thinking and wisdom of the respected Jing Jiang of Lu, who sent her son to study under Confucius (551\u2013479 BCE). In *Discourses of the States* (4th century BCE), Jing is quoted in an argument against indolence: \u2018When people toil, they think; when they think, their good minds are born.\u2019 No wonder Confucius says of her: \u2018The woman of the Gongfu clan is wise!\u2019 (As the scholar of Chinese philosophy [Bryan W Van Norden](https://aeon.co/essays/why-the-western-philosophical-canon-is-xenophobic-and-racist) has pointed out, Confucius in fact \u2018uses Jing Jiang as an example to instruct his disciples!\u2019) Another female scholar in this tradition is Ban Zhao (45\u2013116 CE), who completed one of China\u2019s great studies of history, the *Book of Han* (begun by her brother Ban Gu). It is still the preeminent reference for the era, and contains lengthy treatises on geography, literature, money and more. In her *Lessons for Women*, dedicated to her daughters, Ban Zhao [refers](https://china.usc.edu/lessons-women-ban-zhao-pan-chao-ca-45-116) to the philosophical classics and argues for teaching girls and boys equally to read and write \u2014 to do otherwise is to \u2018ignore the essential relation\u2019 between men and women. This resembles the positions of the much later male philosopher Li Zhi, writing in the 16th century, who praised the importance of women scholars throughout Chinese history. He corresponded with learned women such as Mei Danran, whom he praised as \u2018outstanding\u2019 and \u2018stalwart\u2019. In Korea, Im Yunjidang (1721\u201393) flourished as possibly the first modern female philosopher on the Korean peninsula. She was born in Yangson in the Kyonggi province, close to Seoul, during the enlightened mid-Chos\u014fn era. Unfortunately her masterpiece *Yunjidang Yugo* has not yet been translated into English, which is a shame since Sungmoon Kim, professor of political theory at Harvard University, in 2014 [proclaimed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43289674?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) her to be \u2018the counterpart to Mary Wollstonecraft in the Confucian tradition\u2019. Yunjidang argued for moral equality between men and women and, comparing herself to a male thinker, writes that she is \u2018completely earnest in sharing his aspiration to become a sage\u2019: \u2018The sages are the same in kind as I am.\u2019 **M**oving to the Middle East, one of the founders of Sufism, a diverse branch within Islam, was Rabi\u2019a of Basra (714\u2013801 CE), born in today\u2019s Iraq. She was sold into slavery as a child, but her devotion and ascetic piety (she purportedly used a brick as a pillow throughout her life) inspired Muslims male and female throughout the centuries. In perhaps a distant echo of Maitreyi, Rabi\u2019a once said: \u2018Were the world the possession of a \\[single\\] man, it would not make him rich.\u2019 Noteworthy, too, is the extraordinarily prolific 16th-century female scholar \u2019A\u2019ishah al-Ba\u2019uniyyah of Damascus, who wrote more than a dozen works in prose and poetry. She travelled to Cairo and studied jurisprudence with other scholars, before meeting the Sultan al-Ghawri, possibly because of her reputation as a Sufi master. Recently, Thomas Emil Homerin translated one of al-Ba\u2019uniyyah\u2019s central [works](https://nyupress.org/books/9780814745281/), *The Principles of Sufism*. In this book, she outlines her philosophy based on the four principles of repentance, sincerity, remembrance and love. Al-Ba\u2019uniyyah refers to seven centuries of Sufist thinking, painstakingly quoting books, hadiths, epistles and hagiographies \u2014 commenting on around 100 scholars and thinkers. She argues that love is God\u2019s greatest secret. Towards the end she writes: &gt;*I was joined to them and we stood alone in oneness, and drank the wine, not from cups, but from jars, in the tavern where the oath was sworn. We drank until we were drunk in pre-eternity where drunkenness lasts forever. So you see us drunk on wine, though appearing sober to disguise the affair.* Another crucial female Muslim philosopher is Nana Asma\u2019u (1793\u20131864) from the Sokoto Caliphate in today\u2019s northern Nigeria. Like other girls and boys before British colonisation, Asma\u2019u started school when she was five. Her father was a scholar who argued for women\u2019s rights, and he chatted with her daily about reading and writing, as Jean Boyd and Beverly Mack outline in their ground-breaking collections of her [texts](http://msupress.org/books/book/?id=50-1D0-4080#.W9xCBBP7RBw) and [life](http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=21131). In adult life, Asma\u2019u became a political leader and a founder of the educational network *Yan Taru*(\u2018The Associates\u2019), which is still active today. She wrote in the Fulfulde, Hausa and Arabic languages, and her first text had the fitting title: \u2018Warning for the Negligent and Reminder for the Intelligent Regarding the Ways of the Pious\u2019. She argued for humility between people, and for &gt;*good relations with one\u2019s relatives, servants, and comrades. This is shown by being cheerful with them; doing good things for them; serving them; never acting as if superior to them; consulting them in many matters; helping them financially and physically; not coveting their possessions; not covering up any of their blameworthy affairs that one may discover, and not excusing them for such things; not boasting to them of wealth, position, or nobility; visiting their sick ones; and offering them advice without any pretence or excessive conceit.* On the other side of the Atlantic, more than 100 years earlier, Asma\u2019u had a peer. The foremost early philosopher of post-Columbian North America was the feminist Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1651\u201395), popularly known as \u2018The Phoenix of America\u2019. Sor Juana wrote in Latin and Nahu\u00e1tl, the Aztec language (Edith Grossman has recently [translated](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Sor-Juana-In%C3%A9s-de-la-Cruz/) her into English), and roamed across many genres: she wrote poetry, plays, romances and studies of science, mathematics and, of course, philosophy. In the play *Divine Narcissus* (1689), she mocks the Spanish conquistador as a \u2018barbarian, madman\u2019 and gives voice to the Aztecs. Perhaps her most famous work is a letter written as a response to her fellow nun Sor Filotea, who argued that women should not study certain philosophical disciplines and should rather stick to devotional literature alone. At one point Sor Juana rhetorically asks: \u2018Senora, what can we women know but kitchen philosophies?\u2019 She replies herself: \u2018I say that if Aristotle had cooked, he would have written a great deal more.\u2019 And like Mahadevi, Sor Juana stingingly criticised those men \u2018who for the simple fact of being men think they are wise\u2019. She also draws on the long history of female philosophers, such as Hypatia of Alexandria, to prove the ubiquity of the passion for knowledge. It would have perhaps amused Sor Juana to learn that Sor Filotea, to whom her response was addressed, turned out to be the pseudonym of a man: the bishop Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez de Santa Cruz. **T**he female-inclusive and non-European perspective on the history of philosophy carried on in Europe for hundreds of years. The philosophical canon, such as it is, was [not always](https://aeon.co/essays/yacob-and-amo-africas-precursors-to-locke-hume-and-kant) so European and male, even by the lights of European men. In *Phaedrus*, Plato states that letters and the sciences originated in Egypt. Clement of Alexandria (*c*150\u2013215 CE) asserted that philosophy was universal, originally stemming from the Egyptians, Chaldeans, Persians and Indians, before the discipline \u2018eventually penetrated into Greece\u2019. The historian Diogenes La\u00ebrtius (*c*180\u2013240 CE) included a chapter on the woman Hipparchia in his *Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers*. And when La\u00ebrtius\u2019 history of philosophy was published in Amsterdam in 1758, in French, it had a woman on the title page. To this edition, a third volume was added, written by the little-known philosopher De Chaufepied par Qu\u00e9rard, which contained 100 pages on ancient female philosophers, such as Julia Domna of Damascus and the Neoplatonist Theodora of Alexandria. He also wrote more than 90 pages on Confucius from China. In the 17th and 18th century, European thinkers such as G W Leibniz and Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay likewise proudly found inspiration from China. &amp;#x200B;<oliverlikes>: But this millennium-old understanding of the diversity of philosophy was erased from Europe. As Peter J K Park of Dallas University [argues](http://www.sunypress.edu/p-5655-africa-asia-and-the-history-of-.aspx) in *Africa, Asia, and the History of Philosophy: Racism in the Formation of the Philosophical Canon, 1780\u20131830* (2013), curriculum lists from the early 19th century onwards began to be emptied of women and non-European thinkers. Leading European scholars chose to create a canon based on a new Eurocentric version \u2014 better suited to their imperial, racialised and patriarchal era. Early among these was Christoph Meiners, a professor in G\u00f6ttingen and a proponent for white supremacy, who in his influential work *History of the Origin, Progress and Decay of the Sciences in Greece and Rome* (1781) began to define philosophy as a product solely of the European man. His ideology was carried on by the German historian Wilhelm Tennemann who helped to redefine the history of philosophy in his mammoth *Geschichte der Philosophie*(1798). &gt;*\u2018Within one generation, academic philosophers succeeded in excluding the non-European world\u2019* As Park demonstrates, the tipping point came when G W F Hegel, in 1825, declared that \u2018Oriental\u2019 works should be excluded from philosophy in accordance with the new Kantian faction (who thought that Kantianism was a sort of culmination of philosophy) since it was not \u2018thought, true philosophy\u2019. Ironically, Hegel had been attacked himself by Christian polemicists for presenting a \u2018pantheistic\u2019 and \u2018Oriental\u2019 thought system. Hegel answered by joining the Kantian faction as a defensive manoeuvre \u2014 presenting Hegelianism as a synthesis, a true philosophical development. \u2018Within one generation,\u2019 Park concludes, \u2018academic philosophers succeeded in excluding the non-European world and in consolidating a canon of philosophy that powerfully legitimised their discipline.\u2019 To be sure, philosophers today are finally pushing back on this myopic view of their discipline\u2019s history. For instance, the creation of a new, more inclusive canon will be discussed at the 115th annual meeting of the American Philosophical Association (APA) Eastern Division in New York in early January 2019. And in the past couple of years, new student campaigns have been asking questions such as \u2018[Why Is My Curriculum White?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dscx4h2l-Pk&amp;feature=youtu.be)\u2019 and demanding a decolonised and \u2018liberated\u2019 curriculum. Meanwhile, leading columnists such as Minna Salami in *The Guardian* have also pointed out that \u2018philosophy has to be about more than white men\u2019 as its existential purpose is to investigate \u2018all human existence\u2019. In July, 2018, Anita L Allen, professor of law and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, became the first black woman to be president of the APA\u2019s Eastern Division \u2014 the APA itself is now taking diversity [seriously](https://www.apaonline.org/page/diversity_resources). And the Collegium of Black Women Philosophers, founded by Kathryn Sophia Belle at Pennsylvania State University, is also vital. In November 2017, it celebrated its 10th anniversary with a keynote speech by Angela Davis. Canada\u2019s New Narratives in the History of Philosophy is also dedicated to reinvigorating the philosophical canon. Nevertheless, the numbers still [reveal](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d11/tables/dt11_270.asp) that women of colour in the US, and in Europe for that matter, are better represented in natural sciences than in academia\u2019s oldest field. No other discipline in the humanities is [less diverse](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/552772) in terms of curriculum, students and professors. The philosophy departments, [journals](https://blog.apaonline.org/2017/05/25/how-to-improve-the-situation-for-women-in-philosophy/) and curriculum lists are often as [lacking](http://women-in-philosophy.org/resources.php) in diversity now as they were in the 1970s. So, here we are, two centuries after the ideological creation of the new canon. No wonder none of the above female philosophers from Asia, Africa or Latin America, all born before the exclusion of the 19th century, are included today. They do not fit within the canon\u2019s artificial strictures. Neither do early modern European women philosophers such as Elisabeth of Bohemia (1618\u201380), even though her critique of Cartesian dualism made Ren\u00e9 Descartes concede in a letter to her: \u2018In view of my published writings, the question that can most rightly be asked is the very one that you put to me.\u2019 Like Gargi Vachaknavi in India some 2,300 years earlier, Elisabeth was reclaiming her time and space. One day, it might become possible to include the voices of marginalised philosophical women again. These women highlighted the questions that were most pressing in their time, and theorised philosophical answers that still need to be discussed in the 21st century. Philosophy was once a woman\u2019s world. It is time to reclaim some of that lost realm.

The question at issue is not when/whether civil disobedience is okay. The question is under what circumstances, if any, a person is morally obligated to suffer an Or pass by an injustice. And that question cannot be divorced from history, specifically the history of oppression of people by their governments. He touches on but disappointingly does not drill into the core issue: is there some magical fairy fountain, ordained by the purple spaghetti monster, that grants an elixir of authority that some makes a Pope more authorityfull than a pauper. Perhaps there is some watery tart flinging scimitars at the elect. But the burden of proof is on the state to show what it is. And I do mean SHOW. Not argue. Point to it-it\u2019s over there and people didn\u2019t make it.<grizwald87>: &gt;But the burden of proof is on the state to show what it is. Why so? The citizen has accepted that the state is the only source of moral authority - that's what it means to be a citizen (see my detailed response below). What does the state have to prove to anybody?<GearheadNation>: I have quite seriously not ever met an individual who has accepted that the state is the only source of moral authority. Virtually everyone I have ever discussed this with see that as an absurd assertion. I know very few who would accept that the is A source of moral authority at all. Most will accept the state as the appropriate enforcer of a moral order but not the source of that order. So the idea that the citizen has accepted anything of the kind seems factually flawed. Maybe you are confounding that concept with the concept of \u201cgoing along to get along\u201d? Beyond that though, the objective fact is \u201cgovernment\u201d is an emergent phenomena, individuals are first principles. There is no such thing as a government, whether in men, dogs, or monkeys, without individuals. There are currently and have always been men walking around the world out of the sphere of governments. Any morality, authority that a government can have can come only from one of two places: the will of individuals or \u201csomeplace else\u201d. So for a government to claim authority greater than any individual, the individuals forming that government have to prove one of two things. 1. They are in some moral way simply superior to another individual but not as a function of their role in government (no circular reasoning allowed) or 2. They have to point to the scimitar flinging watery tart that is OBJECTIVELY in a position to dictate moral law independent of mankind\u2019s suppositioning. The alternative, which is your first sentence, leads to an absurd (but popular) conclusion. That is, it is wrong for a citizen to rebel against the government UNLESS they can overthrow the government and become the government themselves. In which case either \u201cright can come from wrong \u201c or \u201cmight retroactively makes might\u201d. I recognize that if you\u2019re Stalin or Castro or Xi, Pol Pot or Idi Amin that Social Contract Theory is really really convenient. But it doesn\u2019t really hold water (the motion of the ocean, of course, being the emergent property of trillions of water molecules).<grizwald87>: &gt;I have quite seriously not ever met an individual who has accepted that the state is the only source of moral authority. Howdy! &gt;Any morality, authority that a government can have can come only from one of two places: the will of individuals or \u201csomeplace else\u201d. I think you're right to take this to first principles. I think there are two kinds of morality. One is subjective, personal, and immune to criticism on grounds other than internal logic. Call this the nihilistic floor. An individual can come up with whatever predicates he chooses, and no matter how ridiculous or ungeneralizable they are, \"what's best for me is all that matters\", \"what is best in life is to hang upside down from trees\", there's no mathematical, logical, or objective \"truth\" that renders those propositions unfalsifiable. Then there's a second morality, which I'll call social morality - the rules that individuals who have chosen to live together choose to adopt. It's possible in practice to be much more objective about analysis of the foundation of social morality because if the outcome of a certain formulation is \"then society collapses\", we can safely say that a new model is called for. I'm positing that in order for any society to function, the individuals within that society must (and do) cede their privilege to make final decisions about what is moral to the state, whatever the state looks like. Since we're all born as part of a society by default, it's probably more accurate to say that we are born having ceded moral authority to the state, and at a moment in our childhood when we first recognize that we have done so, we either begin to continuously reaffirm that cession by inaction, or reject that authority, e.g. running away from home or blowing up Parliament with gunpowder. This doesn't mean that individuals (who upon agreeing to be members of society I'll call \"citizens\" as a shorthand) can't debate what the state's moral code should be, or attempt to modify that code. But it does mean that social morality exists independent of what the citizen believes it should be. In practice we see this all the time. To pick a topic at random, if you're an American your personal morality might conclude that every citizen should be entitled own laser-guided surface-to-air missiles, or that nobody but the government should be allowed to own firearms of any kind. Social morality is somewhere in between, as codified by the constitution, its amendments, judicial interpretation of that document, and the laws and regulations that flow therefrom. Note that in the above case, your personal morality is irrelevant: moral authority rests with the state, and as a citizen you have agreed to bend your neck to the formulation of morality that the state ultimately provides you, whether you personally agree with it or not. Civil disobedience is an individual taking the right to dictate morality back from the state, and living in part or in whole by their own formulation of what is right. When a citizen takes that step, there are only three possibilities: (i) the state coerces the citizen to conform, in which case resistance was not justified by social morality (the Unabomber); (ii) the state fails to coerce the citizen, who is joined by a sufficient number of others that the state is forced to modify its moral code - the citizen is retroactively justified (Rosa Parks); (iii) the state fails to coerce the citizen, but nor do sufficient other citizens join the rebel to force society to change its rules. The state is weakened or destroyed, as its capacity to coerce has failed, and some of its citizens now live in one or more respects as they please rather than as the state dictates (Revolution. On a small scale, communities where law enforcement has little purchase and the rules are made by gangs or prominent individuals or families. On the smallest scale, speeding on the highway or littering and getting away with it). The state's ability to coerce the non-conforming individual is the only functional barometer of the justness of that individual's disobedience. If the individual is successful, the state is either modified to adapt to the citizen, or weakened/destroyed and of no importance. If the individual is not successful, nothing he or she believed is relevant (from the perspective of social morality). **Edit:** Socrates choosing to submit to an unjust death sentence is a good example of someone deciding to place social morality over personal morality. **The question is not whether civil disobedience is justified. Social morality never permits justification of civil disobedience, by definition.** The question is whether social morality has deviated so far from your own personal morality that your personal morality compels you to reclaim your right to dictate morality from the state. This is an ungeneralizable question that has a different answer reflecting each individual's differing personal moral code and its current level and quality of tension with the state in which that person is a citizen.<GearheadNation>: I like your exposition. I am uncomfortable with \u201csocial morality\u201d, preferring instead \u201cconvention\u201d or \u201cstatus quo\u201d, but that\u2019s a quibble. The \u201cceding from birth\u201d idea disturbs me though it\u2019s not new. To use a very inflammatory example, one could assert that \u201cit wasn\u2019t rape because it wasn\u2019t nonconsensual, and He knew it wasn\u2019t non consensual because she never screamed or fought back.\u201d I could go back to \u201csource of authority\u201d but that would argue in a circle. What I would point is that, as in the above example, \u201cendorsement by silence\u201d has been explicitly denied as valid in many cases and in no cases that I know of EXCEPT government is it seen as a valid method of contract. Like I said, I think you have laid it out clearly. But it is still a \u201cmight makes right\u201d argument. But maybe that is the best we can come up with short of the \u201cnihilistic floor\u201d. For my part, I strongly prefer a founding fathers type approach. Namely, there are natural rights (negative in nature) that come with the package of being human. The only job and only authority of government is securing those rights- full stop. This seems to me to solve the whole question.<grizwald87>: &gt;The \u201cceding from birth\u201d idea disturbs me though it\u2019s not new. To use a very inflammatory example, one could assert that \u201cit wasn\u2019t rape because it wasn\u2019t nonconsensual, and He knew it wasn\u2019t non consensual because she never screamed or fought back.\u201d I don't dislike your example because it's inflammatory, but because I'm not sure it fits: our social morality's definition of consent to sexual behaviour is that it is not confirmed, invalidated or avoided just because the object of the sexual behaviour didn't scream or fight back. Intead, it's a bit like the Catholic idea of baptism followed by confirmation. When you are a helpless, uncomprehending newborn, a deal is cut on your behalf extending certain privileges and certain responsibilities, and there's nothing you can do about it. Nor would you want to, though: one of the privileges is your right to continued life and nourishment, and the responsibilities are extremely few, practically non-existent. Like baptism, it's all benefit. At a certain point, though, usually in your teenage years, you gain an awareness that you've been signed up for this social contract, and the *moment* you become aware of it, true consent begins. This isn't a big deal, because you can withdraw your consent whenever you want. It's a continuous, moment-to-moment transaction that frankly almost always favours the individual in the modern world, because people who are able to post on reddit generally live in pretty cushy societies by historical standards. Think of all the things you get in exchange for constantly re-upping on the social contract: clean water, free food, heated shelter, protection from bad people, bad weather, and bad animals, etc., and all you have to do in exchange for those perks is agree not to assault anybody or take their stuff, more or less. If you want to argue there are such things as natural, negative rights, I'm all ears, but I want you to explain it to me like you're talking to Genghis Khan circa 1200 AD, and you're standing in front of something that he and his 100,000 closest friends want for themselves. He's in a good mood, so if you can convince him that your natural rights exist, he'll turn around and go home.<GearheadNation>: I like your ghenghis khan example. In that case I would explain nothing. I would welcome them in, and because nights are cold and we are hospitable, I would see to it that every mongol warrior gets a new blanket. One that is loaded with smallpox. Was that immoral because this happened to be just an expeditionary force and now there 1000000 more coming? Or was it moral because now there are no Mongolians and I can beat my wife without interference whenever I want? Is there really any right and wrong, or is the only right to take what you can and the only wrong getting caught? Or, more to the topic, was Slavery wrong back then BECAUSE it is seen as wrong now, and if I move to someplace where it is accepted has it become right again? Another slice: in your formulation, is a crime (murder?) wrong when you do, or wrong only when/if you get caught? I put up because in terms of extending ones own agency a lie can be as or more effective than a riot. And as you pointed out, if you can get the state to \u201cnot win\u201d then you\u2019re not wrong. This is like the rape example. The rape example applies because the public is what is (as you pointed out). But as you also pointed out, that morality is also contingent solely on the states ability to force you into conformance with the public will. <grizwald87>: &gt;One that is loaded with smallpox. Was that immoral because this happened to be just an expeditionary force and now there 1000000 more coming? Or was it moral because now there are no Mongolians and I can beat my wife without interference whenever I want? Not socially immoral to fool Genghis with the smallpox blanket. Of questionable efficacy due to smallpox's incubation period, but as there's no social contract between you and Genghis, he can't complain that what you did was somehow objectively wrong. &gt;Was Slavery wrong back then BECAUSE it is seen as wrong now, and if I move to someplace where it is accepted has it become right again? I think you're jumping way ahead without spending enough time on the definition of wrong. Slavery isn't objectively wrong. We've only decided in the modern West that it's wrong and are retrospectively judging history accordingly. Considering the public support for \"prisoners with jobs\" that currently exists in America, it's not clear to me that we're all ad idem about slavery even now. &gt;Another slice: in your formulation, is a crime (murder?) wrong when you do, or wrong only when/if you get caught? A crime is a breach of social morality by definition, whether you're caught or not. The state's failure to successfully punish the wrongdoing, either because you're never discovered, never caught, or never effectively punished, leads to a weakening of the state. &gt; I put up because in terms of extending ones own agency a lie can be as or more effective than a riot. And as you pointed out, if you can get the state to \u201cnot win\u201d then you\u2019re not wrong. This is like the rape example. The rape example applies because the public is what is (as you pointed out). But as you also pointed out, that morality is also contingent solely on the states ability to force you into conformance with the public will. I'm not certain what you're saying here. We all have our personal moralities, and I'm not saying we shouldn't, nor am I saying we should never act on them. Remember the context of the discussion, which is whether an unjust state compels civil disobedience. **All I'm saying is that trying to justify civil disobedience via social morality is inherently contradictory**, because civil disobedience is by definition rejection of social morality. To your own original point, the state has no burden of proof with respect to its moral legitimacy, because legitimacy isn't a concept that applies to states or the societies that create them. States simply *are*, and you are entitled to go your own way, in whole or in part, at any time, for any reason. This isn't an all or nothing proposition, either. States are never perfectly capable of coercion, and in fact are often capable of only very limited coercion. When everyone drinks during Prohibition or smokes marijuana prior to its legalization or visits Cuba despite the ban on doing so, we express our own personal morality and the state is weakened, albeit in a non-critical manner. I'm still waiting to hear your explication of natural negative rights, to Genghis as is my preference, or otherwise.", "num_messages": 9, "avg_score": 4.0}

Richard Rorty reviewed this book as \u201cWilfrid Sellars described his project as an attempt to usher analytic philosophy out of its Humean and into its Kantian stage\u2026 Brandom\u2019s work can usefully be seen as an attempt to usher philosophy from its Kantian to its Hegelian stage\u2026 This sort of free and easy transition between philosophy of language and mind on the one hand, and world-historical vision on the other, is reminiscent not only of Mead and Dewey but also of Gadamer and Habermas.\u201d The reading group will take place on a discord server: [https://discord.gg/VQ3JcQ](https://discord.gg/VQ3JcQ), we will meet and discuss the readings every Saturday, and we will recap the discussion in the ODT threads on r/philosophy.

I understand wanting to live with less disease and helping those with disabilities. But, the whole idea of merging humans with advanced technologies to try to live forever or extend life expectancies way beyond their reasonable limit seems totally unethical. Mortality is a huge part of what makes humans human and so to take that away seems like you're removing our humanity. It's all too rational. Humans are inherently irrational and that is another cornerstone of what makes us human. I think to remove our mortality and our freedom to be irrational is to remove our humanity and essentially wipes humanity off the planet. <Edit>: Can't keep up with all the replies, I've said my piece and stand by it. If you want to talk more DM me, Cheers.<PsyloPro>: This doesn't make any sense...<MeatCleaver2>: What part?<PsyloPro>: Pretty much everything, man. It is too rational? Humans may often act irrational, but that doesn't make irrational behavior ethical. Your whole post seems like some kind of pseudo-philosophy to me. There's no valid argument to be found. But I guess you're not too big on that whole rationality thing.<MeatCleaver2>: Well, in my experience when someone just says \"you're wrong\" without providing a legit counter argument or explanations as to why I'm wrong it's usually because they don't have one good enough. <PsyloPro>: What I do not understand is your claim that transhumanism is \"too rational\". What does that even mean? Humans may act irrational and may even have an irrational nature of some sort. But how should come any legitimate ethical claim from this? Philsophy, as I understand it, is just making use of our rationality. It's the only thing guiding us towards knowledge. If something can be \"too rational\", all our discussions lose their basis.<MeatCleaver2>: What I'm saying is that AI, if it bases its decisions off of algorithms, will only ever use pure rational thinking in its decisions. My arguments is that humans are, at heart, extremely irrational beings and that if we are emerged with a technology that causes us to only think in a rational way then we lose big part of what makes us human. If you want an example, compare Spock to Captain Kirk. Or even better, compare Data to Captain Kirk.<Letsboom>: I think this is a common misconception people have with rationality. I don't really think it is fair to assume these depictions of 'rational' characters to be accurate or representative of an actual rational agent. See \"the straw vulcan\". <MeatCleaver2>: I'm not saying that we need to be completely irrational and emotional in order to be human. I'm saying that those qualities are expressly human and that removing them completely removes the foundational separation between us and machines. <Letsboom>: Do you believe that having emotions and being rational are mutually exclusive? <MeatCleaver2>: NO JESUS just read what I said. Having emotions and being irrational are a part of being human but they don't completely control us. We are obviously capable of being rational<Letsboom>: We don't seem to lament people becoming 'less human' when they make more intelligent and rational decisions. I'm not sure why then suddenly we assume that being fully rational leads to one giving up some essence that makes them human. You can reduce all the decisions that people make and their behaviours down to algorithms essentially, and to improve and optimise those algorithms is to be rational. <MeatCleaver2>: People are not algorithms. We are capable of rationality but a large part of our humanity is based in our need to express ourselves in irrational ways. If you think a person can be an algorithm you gotta live more. <Letsboom>: Why can't people be reduced down to algorithms?", "num_messages": 15, "avg_score": 119.8}

To clarify: I think there's a huge qualitative difference between something like the Trolly problem and something like Mary's Room. People can imagine the first. People don't even know what it would take to imagine the second.<redsparks2025>: &gt;I think the biggest problem in the \"method of cases\" is when argument proceed from cases that couldn't possibly occur and which are so far outside of experience that there's no reason to believe anyone's intuition is valid. Basically you want to *kill* the question of \"*what if*\" as soon as it is asked. As long as everyone is aware that what is being discussed is a \"*what if*\" case then there should be no issue. The issues arise when we forget we are discussing a \"*what if*\" case and lose ourselves in our own auguements and get passionate about our own point of view on what was origonally a \"*what if\"* case. Einstein pondered for years on what would happen if he could ride on a beam of light. He was left alone to his \"thought experiment\", his \"daydreams\", his \"fluff\". Whilst everyone else of his era was pondering on how to turn their nation into an empire by making better weapons of war. A side effect of Einstein pondering on riding a beam of light is that he gave his contemporaries better insight into making the nuclear bomb; and it was as simple as E=mC\\^2. Science is dead as soon as we stop asking \"*why*\". Philosophy is dead as soon as we stop asking \"*what if*\". Thinking is dead as soon as we stop asking questions. Period. **EDIT:** Another issue is that the \"*what if\"* question may challenge one's current worldview. And a lot of [self-righteous](https://i.imgflip.com/1dt879.jpg) people don't like having their worldview challenged.<dnew>: &gt; Basically you want to kill the question of \"what if\" as soon as it is asked. That's not at all what I said. It's fine to ask \"what if.\" It's irrational to answer \"I already understand the answer to this question that makes no sense.\" I have no problem with people making logical arguments from the \"what if\" point of view. The problem is when people (for example) postulate that Mary could know everything about her own thought processes (which is physically impossible due to the pigeonhole principle) and they say \"*Obviously* she would learn something new.\" Or people who talk about free will and say things like \"Obviously, if you reset the entire universe to how it was ten minutes ago, everything would proceed apace\" or \"Obviously, if you knew everything there was to know about the entire universe right now then you could calculate what it's like in ten minutes.\" I have nothing against cases like the Trolley problem, where clearly such a situation could be created without violating logic, math, or even known physics. I don't even have *too* much of a problem speculating about what would happen were physics different. But the Mary problem (for example) is literally illogical - it's mathematically impossible to store in an information storage system everything that's needed to be known to reconstruct that storage system's behavior. I have trouble with people who say \"It's intuitively obvious that if 1+2=97, then the following circumstances would hold...\" I mean, it's the whole \"What is it like to be a bat\" thing. You can't possibly have a valid intuition about what it would be like to be something completely unlike a human being, and arguing that it's \"obvious\" that it would be in such a way seems absurd to me. Saying \"It's obvious that Mary learns something new\" seems as absurd to me as saying \"It's obvious that a bat would believe ... about what it's sensing.\" But feel free to change my mind. :)<redsparks2025>: &gt; I have no problem with people making logical arguments from the \"what if\" point of view. Well **what if** the \"what if\" case did not agree with what you consider \"logic\"? You should try and consider \"what if\" cases as a challenge to yourself to think outside the box. Though in the end you may not except the \"what if\" case, you may however gain some other unexpected insight you may never had considered if your logic was not challenged. BTW 1+2 = 97 = 1 x electron in stable quantum position + 2 x electrons in quantum superpositions = 4 or more x electrons. [Flat Earth OR Why Do People Reject Science?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGvGQSazaTM) ~ Philosophy Tube ~ Youtube <dnew>: &gt; You should try and consider \"what if\" cases as a challenge to yourself to think outside the box. That's certainly possible. But why would you think that your intuition in that case has any relevance to the question? Indeed, I think about the what-ifs, and consider them carefully, and figure out what the flaw in the what-ifs are (when I find flaws, of course). For example, I thought about some of Searle's arguments for quite some time before I realized he's arguing that if humans worked like formalisms, they'd do things formalisms cannot, which leads to a clear conundrum he never seems to recognize or address. If you're going to argue that Mary *obviously* learns something new, you cannot do it on the basis that you're thinking outside the box, because that is by definition *not obvious*. There's no *reason* to say Mary learns something new instead of not learning something new; the only argument is \"I imagined this physically and mathematically impossible situation and my personal naive intuition suggests it to be so.\" I don't think making statements with no support about impossible situations is even philosophy, let alone useful or informative.<redsparks2025>: &gt;I don't think making statements with no support about impossible situations is even philosophy, let alone useful or informative. I agree that there are impossible situataions. But.... There is no such thing as a \"*statement with no support\".* That remark may shock you and sound counter intuitive but it depends on what you consider as \"support\". Well I don't want to go down that rabbit hole of defining or even justifying what counts as \"support\". So what is my point? Well what your comments tell me is what I often feel as well, i.e., frustration and a lack of patience for nonsense. But is that enough support / justification to close one's mind or even think in a way that closes one's mind? The later is the worst. What those that think or speak nonsense need is \"constructive\" criticism. Part of the \"constructive\" process is finding out what is the *true basis* others are using to support their nonsense statements. Unfortunately that \"constructive\" process really tests one's patience and provides a lot of frustration. However if one truly want to help others then that is the price one has to learn to accept. I understand there are a lot of bullsh\\*tters and trolls and that is why one has to pick one's aurguments with care. So if philosophy is not about helping others (or society in general) then what is it truely about? Does it then just become the rhetoric of helping one self? \"*You have to understand. Most people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured and so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.*\" \\~ The Matrix, Morpheous. <dnew>: &gt; Part of the \"constructive\" process is finding out what is the true basis others are using to support their nonsense statements. I often manage that. And what it comes down to is unsupported intuition. It's so obvious to some people that Mary would learn something new that it takes half an hour to even get them to admit that it's an assumption rather than a fundamental part of reality. And yes, of course there are statements with no support, by which I mean you can of course have beliefs with no arguable basis in reality. I can assert that slavery is good, logic is useless, and that it's obvious how to store a container inside of itself, and never once have any reason I can express that says why I hold those beliefs. It's not even nonsense. It's often simply a blindness to the logical implications of one's own arguments. The thought experiments are constructed in such a way as to say \"Imagine a world in which XYZ wasn't self-contradictory. My intuition tells me ABC in that world. Therefore, ABC must be true in the real world.\"<redsparks2025>: Most of what you say I agree. However your examples of statement without support can be provided with support (though you may not agree with the morality of that support). a) suppport for slavery is good = slaves allow capitalist to turn a bigger profit than having to pay wages or saleries. b) suppport for logic is useless = brute force and intimidation can work as effectively and does not require one to spend years to be educated or money invested into the educational system. c) suppport for it's obvious how to store a container inside of itself = the container exists in a universe that has more than three dimensions. Remeber I said way back that *\"you should try and consider \"what if\" cases as a challenge to yourself to think outside the box.\"* Just like in the game of chess, in a philosophical debate you have to be several moves ahead of your opponent. To do that you have to consider what is the other person considering? You have to get outside your mind, your box, and get into their mind, their box. [Philosophy - Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ33gAyhg2c)\\- School of Life \\~ Youtube<dnew>: &gt; examples of statement without support can be provided with support Of course. But that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about people who *don't* have support for their beliefs. They're basing it on intuitions, rather than arguments. Like \"Of course Mary learns something new.\" If that's the degree of support, then no further discussion is possible. If your support is \"Mary learns something new because the universe has six dimensions\" then we can debate whether that's reasonable or useful information that supports your intuition. &gt; the container exists in a universe that has more than three dimensions. But then drawing intuitions about how things would behave in such a universe is the problem. If you say \"Obviously, in a universe with more than three dimensions, greebles do indeed flurbulate\" then I can debate whether greebles flurbulate in a universe with only three dimensions. If you don't provide your support for why you think containers can fit inside themselves, then I can't point out that even in higher dimensions, containers cannot fit inside themselves mathematically speaking, thus requiring you to explain how the physics of such a universe necessarily differs from what math would imply, and then of course support *that* contention. But as soon as you assert that *obviously* something you couldn't possibly know about is true, it cuts off all utility of the discussion. It's like asserting that it should be obvious to everyone what life after death (if any) is like - you can't possibly know that, so there's no basis for telling me I'm mistaken about it, *regardless* of my opinion. Basically, offering an intuition about something as if it's the truth, when said intuition isn't shared by the person you're talking with, is unsupportable and not useful. And that tends to happen much more when you think you have a valid intuition about something you couldn't possibly have any experience of. I'm not arguing that thinking outside the box is not useful. I'm arguing that if you think you're thinking outside the box but stating that it's merely obvious, then you're not actually thinking outside the box. If you're actually thinking outside the box, you can explain that in some way other than \"it's intuitively obvious.\"<redsparks2025>: You are overthinking my counters points to your examples. I just ran off the first thing that arose in my mind when I read your examples. Anyway I find your comments on *intuition* interesting. I think I understand now where you're comming from. How do change the mind of someone who makes claims on intuition? That's a tough one. I believe the best that I can hope for is to get the other party to atleast aknowledge that I also have a valid (though different) point of view. It's a small win of sorts.

They explicitly decouple perceived time and physical time in the framework. [deleted]: I did read it, they don't decouple the two very well. They use fundamentals in physics all wrong, utilizing Koine terms from physical science in relation to phenomenal time, explaining these inaccurately. For example: Einstein's theory of relativity is used, then almost directly afterwards entropy is discussed as if it's a constant (in direct correlation to special relativity) even outright stating that it's progressive towards chaos theory; which isn't the only thing this article gets wrong with fundamental physics. At the same time the article stipulates to ignore definitive truths for the purpose of the writer's statements. &amp;#x200B; The whole article is littered with fallacies galore.<horacetheclown>: That smattering of philosophy and physics at the start is mostly irrelevant to the actual argument they make though. About particular mathematical objects that could potentially be seen as corresponding to particular subjective states. [deleted]: Well it's only an example of one fallacy among many. &amp;#x200B; Basically it's saying that I cannot perceive certain things due to being subjective, which is already postulated and factual; I already know I don't know everything... This is just saying in layman's terms that: \"we are ignorant, and therefore we shouldn't be ignorant, so drop acid, and you won't be ignorant anymore, here's a diagram of matrices I did.\"<horacetheclown>: Holy cow, you truly did not understand a shred of the argument", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 80.0}

The only thing that really struck me as needing a change was the question about having children. Some of us don't have children because we think we would be bad parents or because we realize that it is literally the worst thing two people can do for the environment, not for selfish reasons. Also, hedonism shouldn't be conflated with egoism or selfishness, and the test may be guilty of that. I am very sympathetic to hedonism as a theory of well-being, but much like Singer and other utilitarians, I think that everyone's pleasure and pain matters equally, and since so many suffer and lack, this requires us to live rather simply ourselves.<TheRealEsioan>: Thanks for taking it, bear that in mind while we're editing it! I fully understand the hedonism thing, we certainly had to be slightly at liberty for the scales. We wanted a balance between being understandable and accessible while being somewhat intellectual. So for a term like hedonism it's easier to generalize that as being about maximizing pleasure, and being opposed to asceticism. Instead of including all the different forms of hedonism. Sane for rationalism. Rationalism is more in contradiction to Empiricism than romanticism from a traditional philosophy perspective, but it's just easier. I will say I think we've balanced it to a point where because there's so many scales most of those intricacies will be covered elsewhere. Still I understand the criticism, thank you!,", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 50.0}

Life follows the fundamental nature of physics, it's an amplification of them, our \"purpose\" is nothing more than to follow the ebb and flow of entropy. I'd be careful of a man who derives truth and meaning from the lion king. He reads into everything, just like religious people do. <JoshuaBones>: Reading into a well-written movie is not the same as how a crazy religious person reads into everything, but enjoy thinking that way so you don't have to contend with what he's saying or improve yourself. I couldn't care less about the existence of a god. Just glad I'm out of the cancer that is nihilism.<saiyaniam>: It's exactly the same, it's going in with a predetermined belief and looking for anything that supports that belief. If he was legit he would not be using stories to find truth as he always does. He'd be using evolution. What is it that he's given you? <JoshuaBones>: You've got to listen to him with an open mind. Evolution is a large part of what he talks about, and it's all rationally explained in a way that's immediately applicable to our lives.<saiyaniam>: What has he given you? Answer please as you said he changed your mind. I have listened to him a lot, he says a load of great true wise words. But also a load of bullshit. I am very honest and open, to an extreme. And I see through him. It's very clear to me he needs an outside force to remain stable, a safety net. For him it's christianity. And he's made a very intelligent and persistent fight towards making it's ideas more impactful and modernised for a lot of people. But he's not honest with himself, despite his constant claims to be so. He has an agenda, and it's to be accepted by a group, to be part of a group. He is not an individual thinker. He can't get past the ape inside him, all his beliefs are based on his mammalian fears and desires. Just like all humans that base reality on the normality of human animalistic desires, sexual reproduction, acceptance into a group, manners, respect, formality, houses, work, etc Everyday human life. Anyone that bases truth on these lower level impulse is totally missing the nature of reality and living as a drone in a system. Everything he believes is based around navigating such a life with a form of finesse. Problem is, he's gracefully dancing in shit. Hopefully when AI does finally come to be in power, it will rid us off all this pointless \"normality\". I can only hope. <JoshuaBones>: Then I take it you've heard him explain people as nodes, and how religious archetypes and stories were made on his first Joe Rogan podcast. Completely changed my perspective on religion, though I doubt that'd be enough for you, since you can't even get past archetypes in movies.<saiyaniam>: All of which are based on the interactions of human nature. Yes I watched it. Deriving the fundamental aspects of truth and reality from humanity's tropes is dishonest. Jordan is an expert in proper manners, nothing more. And manners don't do shit outside of human society. They don't even work well in non christian society. If you want to be an honest viewer of reality, don't listen to any human, not me, not Jorden. No one. Just look at the world honestly. But based on your texts, you don't want to. I know, it's horrific. But be brave. You'll get over it.<JoshuaBones>: Feel free to discredit a man that's help more people than you could ever dream of, and call me a coward for making sense of things.

Chalking it up to primitive emotions is a shallow way to think about it.<saiyaniam>: \"entire point of religion is to avoid the absolute chaos that would and has come from its absence?\" Not true, and a massive tangent I'm not getting into. End of the day it's principals that keep us in check. Not religion. Two totally separate things. Yes, I'm criticizing his use of human experience as a measure of truth. To be honest I don't feel it's right to argue with you if he has helped you. I wish you well.<JoshuaBones>: These principles come from religion, and they keep us from doing horrible things. I'm agnostic and can recognize this. It's not as if you can have principles without it, which is a topic he's talked about. Accepting the method of understanding religion from a biological evolutionary point of view is where we differ it seems.<saiyaniam>: Principles, morality, come from evolution, a group would not survive if everyone thought it was ok to kill or steal etc. Animals have morals, religion has zero to do with it.

And this is basically what believers in markets use as their defense of them. Which, for the most part, is pretty solid. However this isn\u2019t always the case, and I know that Smith would agree. I just finished book one of the Wealth of Nations and I saw an interesting quote which seems to undermine the argument (that originated from Smith) that many libertarian/conservatives use to justify the market as a quasi-moral guide. In reference to merchants, or people who make their living off of profit as opposed to wages, Smith says this: \u201cIt is by this superior knowledge of their own interest that they have frequently imposed upon his generosity, and persuaded him to give up both his own interest and that of the public, from a very simple but honest conviction that their interest, and not his, was the interest of the public. The interest of the dealers, however, in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public.\u201d <Edit>: The idea of markets as a guide is that actions that are in our self interest are in the self interest of everyone else. It is not from altruism that our neighbors get to eat, it is that we pursue our self interest and make food that they will buy from us. I would agree that this is amoral.<cronus97>: Could what you said be rephrased, within the perspective of self sacrafice, to appear as if someone could sacrafice monetary gain in order to waive their right to monetary interaction, and transfer said interaction ability to another person, or individual? Interactions can then cause further uncertainty as to if this waiver of monetary interaction results in an achievable or non achievable purpose? So can we assign a probability factor just to simulate uncertainty of a system, and turn uncertainty into its own unique interaction system? Is slavery just the result of external influence causing a person to be forced into a waiver that enforces interaction within limits? Or is slavery too intense of an literary extream to be accurately used in that statement? <Dark_Clark>: I can\u2019t figure out what you mean in the second paragraph. Can you explain what you mean?<cronus97>: I would love to explain. But first some additional preamble to help your perspective along, this may be analogy and abstraction heavy. Apologies in advanced: I am a Computer Science Major with a background in Security and IA. I am predisposed to thinking in the abstract for alot of my day to day problem solving. I could easily say I live part of my reality inside simulation because of my interactions with people and individuals over networks of information and logic. I would consider myself an individual just as mutch as I would consider you an individual even though we have never seen each other's face, or heard each other's voice, or interacted with each other's communities... That you and I know of. There is a degree of uncertainty, or a degree in which our perspectives in life align, converge, and diverge, or run in phase with each other. The order in which those interactions happen in space and time vary depending on the number of factors we add, remove, and interact with both. We observe the \"motion\" of dimensions by comparing our internal interactions and logic as they interact with our external interactions with other individuals.Where our logic starts to fail us is when we try to project how our own individual perspective fits with another individuals perspective. This add an element of uncertainty, or perhaps detail, into our external stimulus. I like to define this interaction of two individual perspectives under and above two limits of Falsibility. Falsibility is an unorthodox word that reresents a container of (uncertainty) and (chaos) and (interaction). In practice it is like a variable for an invisible string you didn't see but still end up interacting with because it was buried under a pile of leaves. Falsibility could also be thought of as an emotion. Fear, conservation, science, philosophy, religion, peace, space, dimensional manipulation, etc all have the potential of interacting with each other in unforseen ways, or vectors. This falsibility, when executed, introduces chaos into logic. Perfect chaos in computer based mathematics is essentially a nonrepeating static string of information. Prime numbers are a good example of this chaos abstracted onto a 1D numerical plane. We can further randomize the chaos in a computer system by generating our own detail. In computing you can see this expression of adding detail to a system as a modern hashing algorithm. But what happens if we can't control .(Falsibility).(Chaos).(Infinity).(Numerical).(1D).(Flalsibility). Within a closed system? Well, we encounter a variety of bugs. (Unexpected data length).(Unexpected data).(Unexpected data inversion).(Unexpected data deletion).(etc.). It's a very common problem in modern computing, and we have been forced to develop autonomous error correcting protocols to help regain system stability in the event of cascading logic failure. Without error correction this chaos could turn tumorous, and restrict information and logical operation, or it could turn cancerous and start creating new chaos on it's own. Eventually leading to data overflow and full system failure. Hackers can also exploit holes in error correction and/or innate programming logic of an individual system to introduce their own influence on the behavior of a computing system. Esentially they exploit chaos to generate their own truth gate. So the interaction of a hacker can indirectly, through the use of computer systems of a middle man, can exert, from the perspective of authorized users, unknown influence on an otherwise perfectly functional system to enact their own will or Falsibility. The study of Falsibility is akin to the study of unknown factors in mathmatics. The implication of exploring unknown factors is the basis in most people's purpose in life. Falsibility even seems to fit when talking about atomic interaction and even possibly atomic decay (Within simulation). It is a stretch, but I have come to a question of: does Falsibility, the container and interaction dimension, play a larger role in life than just interaction and manipulation within mental and computer logic? What other forms of logic use Falsibility as a tool for it's own propagation and defense and communication? .:.

Forgive me if this inability to understand is caused by some deficiency on my part. Perhaps I didn\u2019t read it carefully enough. I don\u2019t read much philosophy or come to this sub very often. So I may just be unfamiliar with the way you guys talk.<cronus97>: Nope, had to give up drinking and smoking years ago. I'm also new to the sub. I only recently became active as I started seeing the unknown territory in my own field of science. The exploration of philosophy will hopefully shed light on new, unexpected solutions to the problems we face in our world. New solutions means new tools, and new weapons. New responsibility. I don't talk like that often, but I've been working with some abstract models and it feels kinda like the haze you feel after reading a very compelling book and abruptly shut it. It's cool stuff though, and seriously mind boggling. In my notetaking I have just gotten used to typing out how I think logically so that at the end of the day I can turn my phone off and shut my notebook and forget the abstract BS I seem to get caught up in. I am also listening to Starset, so maybe their music is leading me on. *edit* I reccomend you always make your voice heard. If you think something doesn't make sense then say something! Well explored but moderated logic is just how I express myself over text because it isn't as lossy detail wise as the other note-taking methods I have tried. <Dark_Clark>: I\u2019m not saying your words are wrong. But I think that you should try to improve your communication skills. You seem like a really intelligent guy. But I can\u2019t tell what you\u2019re trying to say whatsoever. Communication is really hard, especially with very abstract concepts. The more complex the concept, the more need for good communication. <Edit>: Communication is just as important, if not more, than the ideas themselves.<cronus97>: Definantly. My research is still in it's infancy. And I still don't know if it's even something we can be accurate about. Accurately communicating it will be alot easier once I have made a scratch on the observation of the subject matter. I'm just talking about an aha moment I had after a spark of inspiration.

Except that it's not abstract, it's first person. What you just stated there is a description. It's third person, objective. We can certainly describe what it is for an organism to be in pain. That's different from feeling pain yourself.<hyphenomicon>: Humans don't experience the world unmediated. I don't understand what you're saying.<Marchesk>: Right, we experience a world with colored objects that make sounds and feel a certain way to us. From this, we\u2019ve learned to derive abstract models to map the world. These models aren\u2019t the world itself either, but rather a representation. We\u2019ve built computing devices that can simulate our maps. But these maps or models aren\u2019t the experiences from which they were derived, anymore than a sentence describing the blue sky on a sunny, warm day are. We don\u2019t expect sentences or books full of stories to have experiences. Or physics equations. What makes a computer special such that it can generate experience from abstractions?<hyphenomicon>: Okay, I think we were using the word experience to refer to two different things. I was using it to refer to the mental representation of the world that it feels like we're living in that's really generated in our own heads, and you were using it to refer to the actual things that really happen to someone, outside their own first person view. It's in my sense of the word that the Doom dreams become relevant to the argument over whether machines can have experiences. In your sense of the word, a computer can have experiences if you give it input data, in the same way that a human can't experience sunshine without temperature sensors in their skin and light sensors in their eyes. In your sense of the word, I think even a rock can have experiences, so long as something physically happens to it. This makes the notion of computers having experiences less interesting, and so it wasn't the meaning of the word I gravitated towards.<Marchesk>: No, no. I think you're confusing my argument with someone else's. I mean subjective experiences, so I agree with your post above. The question is whether a computer program can have subjective experiences by some sort of internal representation. That's where I question the use of subjective language when describing what the code is doing.<hyphenomicon>: Okay. You're saying that while all experiences are a kind of abstraction, not all abstractions are experiences, only certain kinds. Is that right? I think what distinguishes abstractions that qualify as experiences from abstractions that don't qualify as experiences is that they're based in sensory data from the outside world and they're used predictively, such that the prediction of how something will behave under certain conditions constitutes part of our experience of what an object is. Water feels wet because I understand (at least implicitly) that it's a liquid that flows over things, and that it's made of polar molecules, and a bunch of similar things like that. And when we use the word wet to describe other liquids than water, it's because we're taking those properties of water and abstracting them to refer to other forms of matter where the same predictive properties would apply.<Marchesk>: &gt; Okay. You're saying that while all experiences are a kind of abstraction, not all abstractions are experiences, only certain kinds. Is that right? No, I'm trying to say that experience isn't abstraction. Experience is first person and subjective. Abstraction is third person and objective. We abstract from across our subjective experiences to arrive at objective descriptions of the world. We do this by figuring out which properties things have in themselves, like mass, shape and chemical makeup. Turns out this physical stuff is best understood mathematically. &gt; Water feels wet because I understand (at least implicitly) that it's a liquid that flows over things, and that it's made of polar molecules, and a bunch of similar things like that. For creatures with skin like us. It probably doesn't feel wet to a fish. Abstraction would mean removing the feeling of wetness (or coldness and warmth) to get at the chemical and physical properties of water. So we could have a machine learning algorithm that learns to discern liquids. But what would it take for the program to feel wet or cold? <hyphenomicon>: I think that first person experience is a form of abstraction, because humans don't experience the world unmediated, instead our perceptions of what objects are is always already baked into our understanding of how objects behave. At bottom, this is determined by human nature, the structure of the human brain, evolutionary biases, and that sort of thing - we come preloaded with beliefs about how stuff behaves and guidelines on how to change those beliefs in accordance with the sensory data we encounter. The same would be true for a machine intelligence, except their bedrock would be intentionally created rather than accidental and evolutionary. If experience is not a form of abstraction in this way, then even rocks can have experiences, and so the question of whether computers can have experiences is trivial. I don't know what it would mean to talk about experiences that aren't abstractions unless one was talking about simple physical data like a rock getting hotter in the sun. I feel like we're talking past each other somewhat but I don't know how to change the argument so that we can engage more productively. Sorry.<Marchesk>: &gt; I feel like we're talking past each other somewhat but I don't know how to change the argument so that we can engage more productively. Sorry. Alright so if we use abstraction for experience, then we can use \"subtraction\" for our descriptions of the world, because we subtract out the abstract qualities of experience that depend on the kind of creatures we are to arrive at the qualities that we think exist in objects themselves. That works well for science. But when we turn it around to understand how our brain works, we have to bring the abstractions back into play somehow, since some brain activity results in these experiences. We can take the subtracted neuroscience and make a simulation on a computer, but we don't know how to turn that into the abstract experiences. Does it just happen? How will we know? Same thing applies to machine learning. If it's performing basically the same function when detecting an object, or utilizing a dream, is that functionality the same as having an abstract experience? The problem I have with that is the subtracted model is not the abstract experience. They're categorically different. But maybe our universe just generates experience whenever the right functionality occurs? That's one possible solution to the hard problem. It is a form of property dualism (subtracted qualities accompanied by abstract qualities).<hyphenomicon>: I think the universe generates experience whenever something tries to create a predictive internal representation of the environment it exists within, if that makes sense. I don't want to frustrate you endlessly, so if that doesn't make sense I'll chalk it up to me being a bad communicator or having incoherent ideas, and we can cut our losses here.

The reading part is \"easy\". Find what you are interested in, read it, if you don't understand something read about that etc. But there is a huge flaw in this for me. It needs to be combined with a creative process to really be an \"education\" vs a hobby. Even reading lectures and criticism of the material isn't the same as even a simple worksheet with some questions to answer. Coming up with my own questions seems futile and I find it hard to write about what I read without any kind of exterior prompt since I just end up making little summaries. So far I can try to write my own criticism of the subject but I find that to be flawed because A) focusing on criticizing material rather than absorbing it seems counter-productive especially when I don't have an any serious background in the material B) coming up with new idea/criticisms feel dangerous when there is no central authority to correct me when I'm wrong (a professor) Is philosophy a discipline only learn able in a university?<coastbutter>: I look at learning philosophy kind of like learning a language. theres a few phases- you learn the words and concepts, you learn to distinguish how an argument is being formed with them, and then how to assess that argument as it cashes out through the reading. the last (and hardest) part is to emulate that yourself with your own writing, which seems like something a philosophy degree would help finalize. have you ever met someone who can read or listen to a foreign language and understand it for the most part, but they can't really speak it that well? they have not reached that final state, probably because they have only \"been around\" that language, but never actively \"participated\" in it. I imagine this to be the case with \"self-schooling\" of philosophy as well....if that makes sense. difficult, but not impossible. if you are already writing little summaries of what you have read, maybe as a creative prompt, you could try and imagine two of your favorite authors critiquing each other's ideas. what would they both agree on? what would they disagree on? now.....can you be the third person who reconciles their views? <JLotts>: Brilliant<coastbutter>: I'd be brilliant if I could take some of my own advice and write more<JLotts>: Have you ever learned a 2nd language. Based on your brilliant correlation, learning another language might sharpen your your philosophical prowess.<coastbutter>: in high school I took Japanese....but it was mainly because I was an aspiring art school student and just wanted to learn how to write/draw the alphabet and symbols. I tried going to some philosophy meet ups in my area and they weren't too exciting. I tried going to writing meet ups as well, but almost all were fiction based. I think my next goal should be to try auditing a class and see where that takes me. I'm a partner in a small business, so I don't have time or money to go to school full time....and I'm not even sure I'd be able to stand taking classes that weren't interesting to me (I dropped out of college after about 3 years of switching majors because of this.....to be bored for me is to be in a kind of hell that I cannot tolerate). I'd just like access to a professor and fellow students who challenge me to write more, and then to write better.<JLotts>: Well you need a motive.

Discovering if something exists has no bearing on the actuality of its existence. It existed either way.<TigerCommando1135>: Some other issues with Pascal's wager is that it's supposed to be a logical argument for believing in God as the \"safe bet\", but in order for the wager to be considered beneficial, you have make multiple assumptions about God. You have to assume that God values believers over non-believers, what if this hypothetical God values non-believers more because they act morally without a need for a creator to keep them in check? At that point you're just assuming God values those who believe more, but the problem of evil shows that you can claim to be religious or non-religious and you can still be subject to suffering and horrors in life. Maybe you'd argue that believing in God is always beneficial. It gives you purpose, easy answers, someone to talk to, and hope when things are bad; that's just a perception though. Just because something is popular doesn't make it correct. What if someone feels better believing there isn't a God, it makes them more confident and happy knowing they don't have to pick the right religion and adhere to a ridiculous set of rules. An argument from feeling is over-ruled by perception, people are not uniform in how they feel about everything. Quite simply, we cannot objectively observe or communicate with God. Perhaps denying God is safer than assuming he exists, you can't know unless God is real and makes its will known.<Fonzoon>: this is exactly why I as a theist disagree with Pascal\u2019s Wager. The argument pretends to deal with unknowns logically, by assuming knowns<LucretiusOfDreams>: Pascal spends the whole *Pensees* demonstrating the uniqueness of Christianity among all other religions and philosophies, which is where the wager gets its strength. Pascal tries to demonstrate that Christianity is a unique religion, and thus deserves a unique response, and then that's where the wager comes in.<Fonzoon>: It may add to a modified version of it the weight of possibility, but certainly not the kind of certainty the wager is associated with today. ultimately, as the Skeptics have shown, and more or less G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorems, all certainty based on proof is an illusion and one has to do a wager based on the induction of experience pretty much every day. as Kant points out: one has never actually proven that a loaf of bread would feed them<LucretiusOfDreams>: If Pascal read what you just wrote, he would have laughed and cried, because all of that pretty much misses what he was trying to say. He wouldn't be mad, mind you, because theists I think are the ones who started this. But, if you want actually consider the wager as Pascal understood it, I would actually read the *Pensees* (and probably GK Chesterton's *Orthodoxy* and *The Everlasting Man,* since I consider them in the same spirit in many ways).<Fonzoon>: It\u2019s not about being mad at all! You don\u2019t realize that you and I agree here. I don\u2019t think the uniqueness of the religion contributes to the underlying purpose of the wager though. His wager tries to conclude a certain guarantee, based on unknowns. I don\u2019t deny a modified version of his wager if his evidence was good enough. but it\u2019s simply not as sound as one would be led to believe by its formulation. what i mean is, Pascal\u2019s Wager is taken as a proof of certainty by reasoning, whereas it\u2019s only a proof of the golden mean of probability by the same<LucretiusOfDreams>: Okay, but Pascal's wager isn't an argument for the existence of God, it's an existential argument in favor of belief in Christ. As Pascal would put it, he isn't trying to talk to the reason as much as talk to the heart.<Fonzoon>: The wager is an argument in favor of theism as it is popularly understood. And it is weak especially if Pascal meant it as you say as an argument for Christ, because without his proofs of the uniqueness of the religion, the wager is useless, as noted. and with them, it\u2019s pointless as it\u2019s common sense that something more likely (due to uniqueness or whatever)...is more likely<LucretiusOfDreams>: He's not arguing that uniqueness makes it more likely, he's arguing that uniqueness calls for a unique response, which is a different matter.<Fonzoon>: im not even sure what that means or if there\u2019s a relatable difference. either way, the wager is still unnecessary the way i see it. you don\u2019t have to agree<LucretiusOfDreams>: I'm not sure what it means to say that uniqueness makes something more likely. I'm simply saying that the two aren't necessarily related.<Fonzoon>: well im sure he meant that if the religion were unique, it probably wasn\u2019t manmade<No_Drink>: But why he would he think that? Why does uniqueness mean it wasn't man made? You could make the argument that uniqueness argues against the truth of it. God should be obvious and simple and revealed to all alike.<Fonzoon>: well if certain characteristics are common to all religions that are manmade are missing would be the implication. and God might reveal general truth to all (eg a conscience), but have specific details be unique (eg Jesus\u2019 life - for the sake of argument)", "num_messages": 16, "avg_score": 3.125}

I wanted to ask something regarding the definition of what it means to be a feminist. There are many versions of it, but one that I often hear is \"to believe on the equality of men an women\". With that in mind, many people pedal the idea that if you believe in the equality of men and women, then you are a feminist. But isn't that simply the case of an affirming the consequent fallacy? A) All dogs are mammals. This animal in front of me is a mammal, thus it's a dog (obviously false) B) All feminist believe in equality of the sexes. You believe in the equality of the sexes. Thus you are a feminist It seems just as obviously false to me, but am I missing something? It seems a little too easy. The people I have heard this from always tell you to \"simply look the definition in a dictionary\". But I'm claiming that if you really want to argue the conclusion of B) then you really need something else than a simple definition like that. By saying it one simply states that feminists are fully contained within the set of all people that believe equality of the sexes, but one hasn't proven at all that that's the only thing that set contains. To me this would be equivalent to a catholic writing up a \"definition\" for being a catholic on which they strongly state the need to be a pacifist. Then they find someone who is also a pacifist and believe that that person must be catholic, even if that person doesn't know it or recognize herself as such. It seems completely ludicrous to me! Any input?<Esrcmine>: The problem is that a is not a subset of b, a = b. So, if a = b, and c=a, c=b. For example, if a person said \"i am a pacifist but not a christian\" that statement is logically possible, as being a pacifist is merely a non-defining characteristic (what i listed as a subset) of christianity. However, if a person said \"i believe in christ and follow the christian church along with christian values, but I am not a christian\" that statement is pretty much logically contradictory, as following the christian church is the defining trait of christianity, and therefore the person is a christian. Thinking men are equal to women is not merely a trait of feminism, it is its entire definition, therefore, while saying \"i think men are equal to women but i do not believe some modern day's feminists views\" would be logically consistent, saying \"i think men are equal to women but i am not a feminist\" is contradictory.<DanyelCavazos>: But that applies only if one accepts a=b. My point is that you haven't proven a=b, you *defined* it as such and then say that it is contradictory and illogical if you don't accept it. Seneca and the Stoics for example had ideas and proposed the equality of the sexes starting from different principles, long long before anyone even coined the term. Many other philosophers and thinkers did too. Also, I think such a definition is very crippling because one can perfectly have a convergent evolution of ideas. I can think and come up with something, and then find out that Aristotle already thought about that. That doesn't make me Aristotelian per se if I actually didn't read Aristotle to come up with that idea. You just happened to derive the same thought from different principles. I think what you are saying is equivalent to stating a definition for the \"romantics\" of the 18th century, and then reading something from ancient Egypt and discovering very similar qualities, and then saying that those Egyptians should have been romantics. That doesn't make sense. Seneca believed in the equality of the sexes, but he was not a feminist. Equality is very much up there with freedom as being one of the most important values. They are larger than life, how can any ideology claim them? In short, I think your argument holds only so far as one accepts your definition, but I believe that's a very contingent position. You say pacifist is not a defining characteristic ... well but what if Christians start saying that it *is* a defining one? Then what? <Esrcmine>: No, because a christian is not a \"person who believes in peace\" its a \"person who believes in christ\". What matters is not what the group says, its what we as society say, and we as society have defined feminism as \"the belief that men = women\". If you have problems with the logical conclusions one can draw from this, call the contact number on your preferred dictionary's website.<DanyelCavazos>: Also, I guess, if \"what matters is not what the group says, its what we as society say\", then if at some point \"we as a society\" define feminism to mean \"X\", then I guess if the feminists complain then we could ignore such a group and simply iterate your answer: \"What matters is not what the group says, its what we as society say\". Would you accept that?<Esrcmine>: Read my answer below, im oversimplifying cause words are really complicated lol and its all debateable. Under this premise though, yes, that would be valid.<DanyelCavazos>: These things always devolve into some spiel about realism v. relativism and then we don't agree on what things to be a realist and on what to be a relativist. That's why I think these larger-than-life definitions (every person that believes X is Y) never work, one is only preaching to the already-converted ones.", "num_messages": 8, "avg_score": 2.0}

So if our reasons to believe are few and unreliable, our confidence should be low, and if our reasons to believe are many and reliable, our confidence should be high, with an appropriate continuum between. So far, so good. &gt;That means if we have no reason to believe something, then we should not believe it Okay. &gt;...and if we have much better reasons to believe something than we have not to, then we should believe it. No. That completely ignores the dictate to \"proportion our beliefs to the evidence\" and the concept of an \"appropriate continuum\" of confidence. Instead, it just pretends that none of that has even been mentioned and treats \"belief\" as a simplistically binary thing - a switch that can only be set to on or off. And scanning through the rest of the essay, it's all along the same lines, and all comes back to this same fundamental error - completely ignoring the understanding that belief is rightly proportioned to the evidence and measured in degrees of confidence and instead treating it as a simplistically binary thing that's either switched on or off, then treating the issue at hand as if it too is a simplistically binary thing, such that our only options are to wholly invest complete and unwavering belief in the author's preferred dogma or to wholly invest complete and unwavering belief in the dogma they oppose. I'd suggest the author needs to go back to the bit about the proportioning of belief to the available evidence and about measuring belief in degrees of confidence (rather than strictly binary off or on), and start over, keeping that in mind.<brent_paper>: &gt;That completely ignores the dictate to \"proportion our beliefs to the evidence\" and the concept of an \"appropriate continuum\" of confidence. Then instead of: &gt;...and if we have much better reasons to believe something than we have not to, then we should believe it. How about: &gt;...and if we have much better reasons to believe something than we have not to, then we should have a high degree of confidence that it is true. Would that fix the problem?<BobCrosswise>: No, because it's not just that one section - that's just where the error first appears. It underlies the entire argument. &gt;We should believe CN unless we find a very compelling reason not to Here it is again, and even more explicitly this time. Again, it's treated as if it's a simplistically binary thing and our only alternatives are wholehearted belief or wholehearted disbelief and the only justification for withholding wholehearted belief is wholehearted disbelief. It completely ignores proportionality. &gt;P1: We should believe any proposition that follows from the findings of more reliable methods over any proposition that follows from the findings of less reliable methods. And really, here it is again. This, in and of itself, might be interpreted to be an assertion that we should have more confidence in the former than the latter, but that's rather obviously not the way it's used here. Instead, the assertion is that we should believe the former *instead of* the latter. Again - simplistic binarism. And more broadly, as long as I'm responding: &gt;Therefore, we should believe CN. First, all other considerations aside, this fails anyway, and I think will inevitably fail, simply because it's an attempt to reason from is to ought. That out of the way: It's likely possible to make the case that CN has greater support than non-CN, and therefore one should justifiably have a stronger belief in CN and/or more confidence in that belief. And the argument that CN is stronger than non-CN could also be made without jettisoning proportionality, so it's noteworthy that the author instead chose to jettison proportionality and jump all the way to a more absolute but ultimately flawed position. That says to me that the real problem underlying this is that those weaker arguments aren't sufficient for the author. The author isn't trying to make that weaker but sounder case - instead, they're trying to make the case that CN is an undeniable truth in which all should believe (which, likely not coincidentally, is much the same way that theists treat their faith), and inevitably failing. The jettisoning of proportionality, the treatment of belief as a simplistically binary thing, the treatment of the topic as a simplistically binary thing and the failed attempt to reason from is to ought all appear to spring from that underlying desire to turn a reasonable inductive argument into an undeniable deductive one - to transform a relatively compelling conclusion into absolute and unassailable dogma. Which is exactly why I said that the author would likely be best served by going back to the bit about proportionality and relative measures of confidence and starting over. I don't mean starting over with the essay or even the argument - I mean starting over reasoning regarding this whole range of topics. In fact, this particular set of topics are among the best examples of the importance of proportioning belief and only noting relative measures of confidence, since this particular set of topics are among the ones regarding which people are most likely to leap all the way to absolute and unquestioned faith in rigid dogma.<GearheadNation>: In terms of how life is actually lived, how is a belief somewhere along the continuum expressed?<BobCrosswise>: I'm not sure what you're asking. If you mean \"expressed\" in the simplest sense - roughly synonymous with \"communicated\" - the English language is brimming full of ways to do that. In a pinch, \"believe\" will do, but that's a bit broad and inaccurate, which is why phrases like \"tend to believe\" exist. Or \"think it's likely that\" or \"feel as if\" or \"would be willing to bet that\" and so on. That's a simple semantic issue though, and as I said, my point is epistemological. Though of course, the two are inextricably intertwined. If you mean \"expressed\" in a deeper sense - how is a belief somewhere along the continuum made manifest in ones day-to-day life - I would say that for the most part, it's not, because (at least regarding the specific set of beliefs that are the original topic here - the existence or lack thereof of \"God\") for the most part, it's not relevant. In terms of how life is actually lived, when, for instance, I feel hunger, I eat and that recharges my body. It's ultimately irrelevant whether that process is a result of an evolutionary adaptation or some divine plan. It works either way, so the question is moot. In the instances in which it might be pertinent (moral decisions spring to mind), it's only necessary to treat it as one would treat any other probability - to fold it into ones calculations, if one so chooses. We work with probability all the time. People generally aren't comfortable with it - they prefer certainty (which preference appears to be exactly what leads them to so often adopt make-believe knowledge when there's no real knowledge to be had), but the mind is wholly capable of operating with only probability and does so all the time. For myself, I disregard it. As far as I can see, I've reasoned through to a moral stance (which would take another essay to explain), centered around respect for individual sovereignty, which if anything is superior to that which is generally mandated by the faithful, so my reasoning is that if the god they posit does in fact exist and does in fact demand adherence to what appears to me to clearly be an inferior moral system, then he/she/it/they is not worthy of even my respect, much less my worship. I guess one could say that's a calculated risk, but it doesn't really enter into my calculations. It should be noted though that I had the luxury of growing up in a third-generation agnostic/atheist family, so I was never indoctrinated with a belief, but was always free to simply reason regarding the issue. And reason by itself always leads to the same conclusion - I don't know. I can (and do) estimate likelihood, but in the end, I don't know. That's okay. It's just one of the many things I don't know. That leads me to another point I wanted to make - I think the distinction between \"natural\" and \"supernatural\" is a flawed one, and more to the point, one that cripples sound reason. If some thing that's currently categorized as \"supernatural\" (God, unicorns, ghosts, what-have-you) does in fact exist, then it's clearly \"natural\" - not \"supernatural.\" To the degree that such a thing might violate our understanding of the principles governing reality, it's clearly not that it actually is somehow able to violate those principles, but that our understanding of those principles is insufficient, such that we don't (yet) recognize how it can be the case that the thing can exist. By making one end of the continuum \"supernatural,\" one relegates to the same position that which does not in fact exist and that which does exist but has not yet been discovered and/or understood. Clearly those are two entirely different classes of things, so just as clearly, to fail to distinguish between them is to cripple ones thinking. I have no idea how much of that, if any, is pertinent, and there's much more to it in whatever direction one might choose, so I can only hope that at least some parts of this sort of scattershot response found a target. <GearheadNation>: Thanks for expanding. What I mean by asking \u201chow it is expressed\u201d is this. Let\u2019s say I believe some action is \u201cprobably\u201d wrong, but I\u2019m not able to go to the mat one way or another. I could express that in a couple of ways. One way would be that \u201cI don\u2019t that even if there is a lot to gain\u201d. But I don\u2019t criticize others for doing it, either. Another way would be that I don\u2019t do that except in cases where it\u2019s really really beneficial in some way\u2014because, well it might be wrong but I\u2019m not so certain as to justify passing this up. So what I was asking is how do you express that uncertainty in your life? <BobCrosswise>: Mostly, I guess, by withholding judgment. Or, as appropriate, once again chastising myself for once again failing to. &gt;But I don\u2019t criticize others for doing it, either. This is pertinent. It's part of my basic moral stance. I think that, and really rather obviously, the only person and actions I can judge with any reasonable confidence is myself and my own. Even setting aside respect for individual sovereignty, it's simply the case that I only have access to my own perceptions and conceptions. There's a practical consideration there too - my actions are the only ones that are feasibly within my direct control (and they might not even be, if hard determinism is true). In either case, the actions of others are not and never will be under my direct control, so there's little to be gained by concerning myself with them, except insofar as their actions demonstrably bring harm to me or to the society of which I'm a part. Well... or unless concerning myself with their actions triggers a pleasant neurochemical rush - the one that accompanies indignation or pride or whatever - but then I'm (hopefully) back to chastising myself. More broadly, the value of appreciating uncertainty, to me, is that it improves my reasoning (or at least avoid crippling it in a particular fashion). It seems clear to me that much of the poor reasoning that's responsible for much of the ugliness I see when I look around the world is a result of people treating their preferred preconceptions as indisputable facts. That not only cripples their reason, but often draws emotion into their calculations - views that run contrary to their make-believe truths are then not merely alternatives, but active threats. One need look no further than pretty much any religious or political forum to see that in action, and to see how destructively irrational it can easily become. That trap can be evaded by remaining conscious of uncertainty.

Best i think there is.<Novisc>: Thanks, I just looked it up. Strawson's \"Analytic Solution\" is really clever. I definitely think there's merit in the idea that induction is intrinsically and semantically a part of rationality. It certainly seems to me that, in our everyday usage of \"rationality\" we imply the use of induction: \"there cannot be any question as to the rationality of the employment of induction, since by being rational we mean, amongst other things, using induction. The question whether induction is rational resembles, according to this approach, the question whether the law is legal. Since \u2018being legal\u2019 means \u2018being in accordance with the law\u2019\" Thanks for sharing, this is a good piece of work by Strawson!<atmh4>: &gt;So to ask whether it is reasonable to place reliance on inductive procedures is like asking whether it is reasonable to proportion the degree of one\u2019s convictions to the strength of the evidence. Doing this is what \u201cbeing reasonable\u201d *means* in such a context. Is his point here that the evidence is the *reason* we trust inducnd tion. The more evidence, the more *reason* we have to believe? If I am understanding this correctly, then Popper explained why this doesn't work. In Conjectures and Refutations, he explained that there are always an infinite number of possible theories that could explain the evidence. In fact, this is a point that even Kuhn made in his theory of under-determination. Under-determination is the idea that for any scientifically based theory, there will always be at least one rival theory that is also supported by the evidence. I suspect you don't need a rundown, but how would you get around this problem?<Novisc>: Well, some people embrace it: they are called pluralists (check out Hassok Chang's \"is water H2O?\" as an example).

Those people often fulfill important roles, likewise billionaire philanthropy can fulfill an important role (i.e. redistributing billions of dollars). All depends on what the individual does.

This is a book about billionaire philanthropy, not a book about capitalism.<steevenK>: He was just on the Rationally Speaking podcast and he does make some more general \"system\" level arguments. For instance, a billionaire may have a child with a disease and they want to give 500 million to a related charity. The vast majority of us would have no reason to dismiss this as not a noble gesture. However, it may be true that that money could have more value if it was spread between some other specific charities. He argues that a government entity would have a better idea of how to most efficiently use this money.

You Should Have Killed Him.\" | an essay on when euthanasia is the most moral choice parents can make <anon33249038>: This comment is it not going to be my most popular comment, I'm sure, but I feel like I have to say it. I find this kind of thinking, if you'll excuse me, very unsettling. I understand the thinking and I understand the argument, I disagree with it. When we start terminating human life (not fetal, don't misconstrue this as being an argument against abortion), independent human life because of suffering and burden, how wide is that net? To what degree are you okay with it? What about the severely and profoundly retarded and the mentally infirm or incapacitate? Should we euthanize the state schools and Mental Hospitals? Their lives are suffering and they are a burden to their caregivers. Wouldn't they be under that same net? What I mean to say is if suffering and burden are your rubric, that could cover a lot more people than you expect. Prisoners, the homeless, the perverted, the orphaned, the addicted, the woeful, how far does your list go? An 75 year old person who is dying of cancer, from what I gather, it seems everybody is okay with that person consenting to euthanasia, because they're going to die anyway and their life from here on out will be suffering and burdensome. Can that not be said of a fifteen-year-old with life imprisonment? The problem I have with telling people that killing people is okay is because eventually they'll think killing people is okay. With every state that has enacted a \"stand your ground\" law, homicides have risen. Why? Because they told people it was okay to kill other people. It doesn't take much to convince people it's okay either, you just have to have a fairly logical reason. That's why I find this very unsettling. There are so many people who are completely fine with ending another human's independent life for trivial reasons like burden. I just have a hard time accepting that.<equil101>: Slippery slope fallacy has no place in the philosophy subreddit. It is a simple minded argument designed to irritate and not argue. You are arguing that if we allow a mother and father to ease the inevitable passing of their child (lets call this Event A) then how do we stop people from euthanizing children that are intellectually disabled but not imminently near death (Event B). They are fundamentally completely different circumstances that are easily governed by a set of rules. Event A does not lead to Event B, thus your argument is a slippery slope.<_Boru>: Arguments for euthanasia centre around the question of undue suffering. Suffering is unquantifiable and laws develop according to historical precedent. It\u2019s \u201csimple minded\u201d to decontextualise ethical questions and assume that the applied solutions have no effect on related issues. <equil101>: But the time spent suffering is quantifiable, which is what we are discussing here not the perception of who suffers more or less. The issue at hand is this. A baby is going to die in 20 minutes and suffer for those 20 minutes, or a baby is going to die in 1 minute with next to no pain. Arguing a life long issue against a 20 minute issue in which death is nearly immediate is a poor argument. The two are so dissimilar it suggests the individual is unable to grasp extreme differences in circumstance.<_Boru>: If suffering is unquantifiable, any attempt to solve the problem by quantifying suffering by an amount of time will always result in nil: Suffering (nil) x Time(20min) = nil or Suffering (nil) x Time(1min) = nil All that is left is whether the perceived suffering outweighs the perceived value of life, according to a third party. The initial commenter was right to point out the dangers of justifying euthanasia on unquantifiable grounds. The value of life itself would become merely a subjective judgement granted to next of kin.<equil101>: Using a nil argument is worse than a slippery slope fallacy and in this case, it is actually applied incorrectly. A Nil argument is used when you are arguing something doesn't exist, not that it is difficult to quantify or that it is subjective. Suffering does not equal zero as your equation suggests, it equals something different to each person. Your nonsense equation is therefore really saying the following, when Fred uses the formula total suffering equals something different for Fred then when George uses the same formula. But it isn't zero (nil), it is still higher for Fred when time goes up relative to Fred and higher for George when time goes up relative to George. So in fact, even though one input is variable, it isn't zero so time does in fact change your formula above. It was an interesting if misguided argument by you. I think more importantly, you are hiding behind a textbook. Unfortunately we cannot live in our own perfect little textbook defined world. Each of us interacts with numerous members of society, generally speaking, on a daily basis. As such, society needs laws and regulations. Laws that have to rationalize and deal with the fact that many things in life are subjective, like the value of life or unique property for example. To argue that because something is subjective means we cannot regulate or attempt to regulate it is in short idiotic. It is hiding behind literature that is purely theoretical. <_Boru>: I apologise for my \u201cnonsense equation\u201d; I was trying to be respectful and save you a long and rambling comment. So maybe it\u2019s my fault that you didn\u2019t understand me. Fred doesn\u2019t apply the judgement to himself, but to George. And Fred doesn\u2019t have access to Georges suffering, subjective or otherwise. We\u2019re talking about one person making a judgement on behalf of someone else. The suffering of George is unquantifiable by Fred, all he has is an impression. I didn\u2019t say that subjectivity means we can\u2019t make laws and I think calling me an idiot who hides behind theoretical literature doesn\u2019t support your point, whatever that is.<equil101>: Apology accepted. I didn't call you an idiot. I just stated that your use of a nil argument in a situation in which no variable is nil (ZERO) was indeed dumb. It is obvious to anyone based on this discussion that you are not an idiot. Here is the problem, Fred and George are just two people, living in the same country under the same laws that were established by far more than one person. Those laws already deal with numerous issues that are perceived differently by individuals, many of which involve suffering. My point is this, your argument is tired and impractical. It is a blanket argument that you could use to argue literally anything. Every single person perceives every single thing in their lives uniquely. As such, every action each person takes is subject to their own perception of it. So using your argument, we cannot imprison people for raping someone if they perceived it was OK. We cannot fine someone for an accident they caused if they perceived they had right away, regardless of if law enforcement deems them to be at fault. It is an argument that both practically and philosophically loses itself half way.<_Boru>: The implications of each moral judgment transforms the ground upon which further judgements are made. \u201cSlippery slope\u201d is not a fallacy, it\u2019s an expression of that fact. I can\u2019t make it clearer that I\u2019m arguing **against** abstraction. Giving one person the right to end another\u2019s life, clearly has dangerous implications. The value of Georges life becomes subject to Fred\u2019s impression of Georges subjective experience. You\u2019re arguing against a caricature of moral relativism, which has **nothing** to do with my point. Your repeated mischaracterisation of my position tells me that your either being disingenuous or not interested in real dialogue. So, I\u2019ll leave it there. <equil101>: We are not going to agree. Slippery slope is absolutely a fallacy, and it is the foundation of your argument. You are arguing if A, then B could happen, then C, and before you know it, we are killing people for the fun of it. Bullshit. Get off your high horse and operate in reality. No where has it been suggested that Fred would make decisions of life or death for George. What is being suggested is that in very difficult but definable medical situations, there is compelling reason to allow intervention that limits suffering. In these situations there are obvious and definable circumstances. When those things are present we have the ability to pass a LAW. That law would govern those decisions, and although law is often not perfect, it would certainly not allow one person to make a decision for one other person, but rather for a group of people to vote to determine what they believe best given the circumstance. If you are not arguing moral relativism then what are you arguing? The statement above you essentially defined moral relativism in an example. You say next to nothing above, and continue to use nebulous terms with little real application in the real world. I will reiterate, based on your argument above, no law could ever exist in issues in which morality or individual perception is at play, which in short means, no law could ever exist. What a stupid argument in the real world.<_Boru>: &gt;You say next to nothing above, and continue to use nebulous terms Where did I lose you? Implications? Caricature? Disingenuous? I don\u2019t have time to add a glossary in my replies, I don\u2019t have time to explain to you what legal precedent is, I don\u2019t have time to reiterate that circumstances related to suffering can\u2019t be obvious and definable, and I don\u2019t have time to point out why suggesting decision by committee exposes your naivety. If you\u2019re finding it hard to follow what I\u2019m saying that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s unrelated to the real world, it means you shouldn\u2019t be having conversations about whether euthanasia is ethical. \\* And I won\u2019t get off my high horse!!

You can use law and authority to stop people from being harmful - an idea which most western legal systems are based on - but when you use the same methods to try to force virtuous behavior, rather than prevent harmful behavior, you open up a whole other can of worms involving free will and the right of people to define a \u2018best\u2019 way of life for themselves.

Automated cars will rarely encounter these situations. It is vastly more important to get them introduced to save all the people harmed in the interim. <annomandaris>: To the tune of about 3,000 people a day dying because humans suck at driving. Automated cars will get rid of almost all those deaths.<TheLonelyPotato666>: That's not the point. People will sue the car company if a car 'chose' to run over one person instead of another and it's likely that that will happen, even if extremely rarely.<ranluka>: Honestly that is what liability insurance is for. These scenario is gonna be rare enough that simply paying a settlement will be cost effective. Much more cost effective then letting thousands die each year.<sandefurian>: Except it won't be rare. You'll have a plethora of people trying to prove that the car company was at fault for the wreck, true or not. Besides, the current liability is on the driver. Self driving cars moves the liability to the actual manufacturers. Huge class action suits for discovering deadly product defects are definitely a thing. Tesla can't just call up Geico and get a quote. <OriginalSyn>: These cars have cameras and sensors all over them, there might be a spike at first but when it proves almost impossible to try and cause an accident with one that doesn't implicate you in fraud they will go away. <sandefurian>: Except there will be. These cars will have to make choices. When a car gets into a wreck and hurts someone, it will be up to the car company to prove that it wasn't their fault it happened. Which will be difficult, no matter how justified. <OriginalSyn>: Sure but most of this will be settled well before it even gets to the court stage. The police and/or prosecutor will see the footage and say to the \"victim\" \"here's you jumping in front of the car/slamming your breaks for no reason/whatever, you want to change your story?\"<sandefurian>: It's very often not going to be that obvious. Manual cars will swerve and self driving cars will have to avoid. Animals will run into the road. Cars will lose traction at some point. Tires will go flat. There will be software glitches. There are going to be a great many situations where the only direction sue-happy people can point their fingers will be at the manufacturers. And then will come the class action law suits. I'm not saying self driving cars wouldn't be amazingly beneficial. Even slightly flawed they'd be great. But these are some of the reasons a lot of manufacturers are starting to hesitate. <OriginalSyn>: &gt; Manual cars will swerve and self driving cars will have to avoid. Manual car at fault for driving dangerously, or if it was swerving something legitimate, then likely no fault. If the AV can't react in time and a pedestrian is hit then they are going too fast and likely the victim shouldn't have been on the road at the time. &gt; Cars will lose traction at some point. AVs will drive more careful than humans in slippery conditions (or won't at all) humans overestimated their abilities and drive in conditions that are far too unsafe, unless it's a legitimate emergency I doubt AVs will operate in those conditions. Hitting unexpected road hazards are much less likely since their other sensors will be able to better detect things like objects on the road, patches of black ice and water. &gt; Tires will go flat. Most modern vehicles have pressure sensors. If it is a road hazard the the vehicle was unable to avoid then it's likely no fault. &gt; There will be software glitches. This is definitely a possibility and it would be regardless of choice would still be the companies liability it would have never been the owners... unless they disabled automatic updates that contained a patch. &gt;There are going to be a great many situations where the only direction sue-happy people can point their fingers will be at the manufacturers. And then will come the class action law suits. Class action suits don't just happen because a bunch of people are angry. There has to be some reasonable suspicion of actual wrong-doing. I'm not saying there won't be some lawsuits and some tricky decisions having to be made but I suspect there will be far fewer involving no win choices that someone else isn't directly and obviously the cause of than you think. <sandefurian>: Dude really? You're being pretty nitpicky about this. There will be multi-car pileups cause by manual drivers. Just like today, that one car that started it won't be legally responsible for the entire chain reaction. Traction loss will most definitely happen often, beit through hidden patches of black ice or sudden rain storms. If you think the entire traffic system is going to shut down ever new the driving conditions are remotely dangerous, you're kidding yourself. Flat tires through road hazards will not stop in the near future. And if you have a blowout on the highway, the car will not always have control over what happens. This will inevitably cause multi-car wrecks with nearby vehicles that couldn't react in time, which was my point. And if you think class action lawsuits require wrong-doing, you have not been paying attention to the most recent successful lawsuits accident Ford and GM. <fierystrike>: Everything you just said is wrong. Every situation you mentioned the car would be able to account for. Raining it slows down, snow it slows down, ice on the roads it slows down. You're kidding yourself if you think these situations are anything other then bullshit. Flat tires would actually be handled so much better in fact because the car wouldn't freak out and swerve when it shouldn't. If it causes the car to swerve the other self driving cars would move out of the way. If it hit a manual car its not the self driving cars fault it has 0 control and outside of finding a fault with tire that caused it to pop it would be assumed to be debris on the road that was not detected and its a no fault accident. If you say why wasn't it detected then you are just trying to find any reason to say no because a human couldn't see that shit and the same thing would happen only worse so the car companies saved lives not took them.<sandefurian>: Lol you're kidding yourself if you think these cars will be able to having the coding to handle 100% of these situations with a 0% fail rate. Or you're just disillusioned to the limits of programming and hardware, and underestimating the veracity of this country's lawyers. <fierystrike>: Your kidding yourself if you think the cars would get in these situations to begin with.<sandefurian>: You're kidding yourself if... Come on man, let's be adults. Agree to disagree. <fierystrike>: You should read what you wrote. The car wont get into these crazy situations nearly as much as people do because they will be programmed to slow down when conditions warrant it something people currently dont do. The only time these situations come up there is someone clearly at fault, the person who made the decision to get in front of the car when they dont have right away and at a distance no one or thing could possible avoid them.<sandefurian>: Fine, let's hammer this out. You pick ONE of the scenarios that I listed, and I'll give you five situations where the cars would have no way of preventing an accident and the at fault party would be the car. I am fully confident and prepared you have not thought this through with the appropriate gravitas. <fierystrike>: A manual car swerves. Not the cars fault since it was the person who swerved. So that one was easy. But to be fair lets go with tires going flat. &amp;#x200B; If a tire pops such that the car changes directions and is unable to pull off the side of the road it is not the cars fault, the tire popped because of an unavoidable road hazard. &amp;#x200B; A software glitch is the manufactures responsibility and always has been. &amp;#x200B; A class-action is no different then a regular lawsuit just that it has multiple people filing together so there really is no difference here so no idea why you included this here.<sandefurian>: Cars A, B, and C are driving next to each other on a 3 lane highway. The tire on car C pops, forcing it to uncontrollably ram into car B. Car A is a self-driving car, and is programmed to react to this situation. Does it attempt to avoid the wreck, keeping it's passenger's safe? If it doesn't even attempt to avoid the crash, it's passengers will get hurt - so that's obviously the wrong choice. What if the only way to avoid the wreck is to move to the shoulder? What if by moving onto the shoulder, it hits a dirt patch that, because the car is going 75 mph, causes the car to flip and kill its passengers? Did the car make the statistically correct decision? Yes, of course. But because of it's decision, it killed people that would otherwise have only received a few broken bones. Roads are unpredictable. The cars and software can be extremely prepared, but it's impossible for them to predict every possible scenario simply because the environment can't be controlled. A classic example would be a kid falling in front of a self-driving car. Does the car hit the kid, or does it swerve into the school bus next to it potentially killing twenty people? The statistically smart decision is for the car to just plow through the kid. But if it does that, the parents of the dead kid are going to immediately sue the manufacturer because they killed their kid when they could have easily swerved, as the video evidence will prove. Right or not, the car still chose to kill the kid. I'm not arguing that these are insurmountable barriers. Just that it exposes the manufactures to a level of financial liability and possible defamation that they haven't had to face before. This is making them pause and over-engineer products that are otherwise street-ready. Even if it would save 1000 lives over the next year, the level of liability the companies currently face is too great for them to justify mass releases. Even Tesla is withdrawing some of their initial confidence, and they're not even officially self-driving.<fierystrike>: Situation 1, wrong. Not getting hit by going into ditch at high speeds would clearly be the wrong choice. I mean seriously a stupid example. Going off road to avoid a collision is rarely the right call. For specifically the reason you said. You have just proven you have some bullshit extreme cases you have not thought through and I have no interest in continuing this.", "num_messages": 21, "avg_score": 197.2380952381}

Academics would find the color scheme unprofessional and the average feminist activist would not bother to read it. With that out of the way... At least from what I can glean from it, the Laboria Cuboniks\u2019s \u201ctechnoscience\u201d is similar to Firestone\u2019s utopian vision in [\u201cThe Dialectic of Sex\u201d](https://www.marxists.org/subject/women/authors/firestone-shulamith/dialectic-sex.htm). Both think that great technological change is needed to end gender inequality, and even the gender binary (as we know it) needs to be abolished. So L.C. has predecessors in that aspect, while attempting to tie it into intersectionality, a concept unnamed in Firestone\u2019s time. So in a way, I think L.C. is using the term xenofeminism to incite feminists to embrace technological change for their ends, making rationality and science feminists rather than dismissing these concepts because patriarchy have wielded them. Next thing this collective needs to do is to perhaps do what bellhooks does and \u201ctranslate\u201d the theory for the masses. Why should feminist movements follow xenofeminism? Maybe [this book](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Xenofeminism-p-9781509520633) does this translation, but L.C. also needs to do the groundwork in spreading their ideas beyond academia.<GearheadNation>: I couldn\u2019t figure out exactly what tech what do what the author wanted.

They also advocate using present technology (like \u201cdigital tools\u201d) as a means to gender equality. Firestone in \u201cThe Dialectic of Sex,\u201d a predecessor to xenofeminism, is more coherent on this front, as she suggests that humanity should embrace artificial reproduction, cybernetics, and robot labor. Fortunately for her, advances are made in those fields, but even she and xenofeminism recognizes that we have to change our attitudes toward technology in order to liberate. One suggestion in XF\u2019s case: \u201cTechnoscientific innovation must be linked to a collective theoretical and political thinking in which women, queers, and the gender non-conforming play an unparalleled role\u201d (0x02). This means changing the circumstances that lead heterosexual cisgender men to be overrepresented in science and everyone else to be underrepresented, alienated, and even oppressed by the scientific technology that they have no say about.

I mean, that would imply that, if we suppose they are opposed to nationalism as you suggest, leftists themselves would see themselves as not-American entirely which could be a stance for a particularly global minded sect but seems unrealistic as most members of the left rationally still see themselves as American. This logic also suggests that leftists are unable to differentiate between the idea of nationalism and the tenants and actions of the Nazi party. Regardless, the logic doesn\u2019t seem to hold up even if nationalism and Nazi-ism were so easily conflated because seeking to improve one\u2019s circumstances and unifying under a specific identity to do so is not inherently nationalism. Nor is it patriotism. As someone who would describe themselves as a leftist, I hold no particular nationalistic feelings but do wish for the betterment of the people who surround me as an immediate goal. This does in fact take precedence over global aims because national goals are useful to me as a means to an end. I think there is a great difference in the idea of nationalism as a political philosophy and a reliance on existing identities to expedite political goals in a pragmatic fashion.<GearheadNation>: I somewhat disagree that most members of the American left see themselves as Americans. Don\u2019t get me wrong, no American leftist smart enough to get a passport can look at it and fail to recognize that they are \u201cAmerican\u201d \u2014 Administratively. The gap seems to me that the left cannot characterize \u201cAmericanism\u201d except in some caricature about the oppression and exclusion of anybody and everybody. It is analogous to asking a German to talk about \u201cGermanness\u201d, \u201cthe German national character\u201d, or \u201cthe German culture\u201d only to find they can\u2019t talk about anything not relevant to political rallies in 1942. I think this is why the left has a difficulty with a positive conception of American patriotism, self interest, etc. There is no conception of a unique, beautiful, valuable, preservation worthy American culture. Which is puzzling considering that the left can and does wax poetic about the beauty and value of many other cultures, despite the fact that you can\u2019t into the history of any significant people group without finding a whole mess of the deplorable things.<drfeelokay>: &gt; The gap seems to me that the left cannot characterize \u201cAmericanism\u201d except in some caricature about the oppression and exclusion of anybody and everybody. Americans on the left seem to celebrate the American victory over darker forces in WWII - these ideas are present in a lot of their culture-war rhetoric against what they see as racist nationalism. They take pride in the multicultural ideology of the US as a largely accepting country of immigrants - which drives a lot of pro-immigration ideas that are less popular in Europe. They think the US is under obligation to convey a humane message and are furious when the president fails to chastise to Duteretes and Putins of the world. People on the left feel more angry when their country engages in problematic military action than when someone else's country does so. Culture wars over the character of the US are largely expressions of left's desire for the US to be and act a certain way. This is identification with the US - there's just no way to dismiss that given the totality of the facts.
