Your Wednesday superpower, superhuman strength and speed would get you out of this easily. Stalling for 15 minutes would be easier if your Tuesday superpower wasn't rubbish <cdrober>: I should have known it was a trap. I'd been searching for Lars Vagabond (I doubt that's his real name) for nearly 10 years now. I thought I knew his every trick and would see a trap coming from miles away. Turns out all he had to do was make an anonymous call to the station saying someone matching his and Johnny one hands descriptions had been spotted by the pier and my stupid ass ran off. *Absolute fucking idiot. Of course it was a trap.* Normally this wouldn't be a problem. See, I have some pretty awesome super powers, and on any given day could have escaped any trap he sprang. However, it's Tuesday, and while normally I have some kind of amazing power, on Tuesdays...well...I don't. Lars smiled at me the two henchmen, I had no idea who they where, dragged me towards the edge of the pier. Lars was wanted for basically every crime imaginable. His rap sheet read like a god damned novel, and included just about every mainland state on the US. Even with my powers, he's always managed to somehow get away. *I wonder if he has powers.* \"So officer Dekard, this is how it ends? A simple phone call on a Tuesday night giving you my location and you come running.\" \"Let me go Vagabond, you really want to finally add cop killer to that awful ballad they're composing for you?\" \"Dekard, Dekard, Dekard\", he made a ticking noise with his tongue, \"you've left me little choice haven't you. I mean, how could we possibly compete with your, talents?\" He said talents like it was an insult. \"What are you talking about, I'm just a cop.\" I was nervous, had he figured out that I had powers? \"Oh please, Mondays and Wednesdays you have both super speed and strength, Thursdays you can read minds, Fridays you teleport, and on the weekends people listen to you even if they don't want to. You never work on Tuesdays, so I have to guess Tuesday is a rest day. Am I close?\" Actually he was right on the mark for everyday except Tuesday. I have a power today, and from the looks of of my watch about fifteen minutes to figure out how to save myself with it. \"Wow, with deductive reasoning like that, you'd have made a great detective.\" Fourteen minutes. \"Oh please Dekard flattery? You really think we're not about to drop your ass into the ocean?\" He motioned towards the cinder blocks strapped to my feet by a thick chain. \"I know your just stalling and honestly I'm over it. Goodbye old friend.\" He waved his hand signaling his men to throw me over board. Thirteen minutes. \"Wait please\", I had an idea, \"please let me call my wife and son. I know, I know, I could tell them where I am but let's both be real all that'll earn me is knowing they'll die too. Please let me hear my son's voice one last time.\" Lars walked up to me and got right in my face, his breath saturated with the smell of whiskey. His dark eyes radiating hatred. \"I'll give you 2 minuets. I know what happens at midnight and we still have\", he stopped to look at his watch, \"eleven minuets left. If you want this phone call then I'm sorry but I'm going to have to stab you so I know you die down there before midnight.\" He took out my cell phone and handed it to me. \"Dial and put it on speaker phone, I want to hear everything.\" \"Yeah of course.\" I unlocked my phone and found my wife's number, I connected the call and turned on speaker phone. Even of it was only a few minutes I had to stall till midnight, my strength and speed will be enough to at least get out of the water. \"Hey baby! You still at work?\" My wife's voice was as clear as if she were right there in on the dock. \"Yeah honey I got called in. I'm sorry but I won't be making dinner tonight.\" I'm proud of how level I was able to keep my voice knowing this may be the last time I hear her voice. \"Aww that's too bad, John was really looking forward to a late taco Tuesdays. He's been struggling to stay up until you got home.\" I almost forgot spring break starts tomorrow. \"I know I'm sorry. Hey let me talk to him and I'll break the news to the little guy.\" \"Mmm okay. John it's your dad\", the last part had been a shout. He was probably in his room playing with his dinosaurs. There was a brief moment of silence and then, \"here he is.\" \"HI DADDY\", his gental young voice exploded from the phone. \"Hey buddy, how was school today?\" \"School was awesome, we learned all kinds of things, like did you know a T-Rex may have had feathers instead of scales?\" His excitement was unparalleled when it came to dinosaurs. \"That's cool buddy, did you do anything else?\" \"Oh yeah lots, we read some, and we had pizza for lunch, and Mrs. Duke helped us count to one hundred by tens and...\", On and on John spoke for what seemed like forever. Once you got the kid going it was hard to stop him. And eternity passed while he spoke even though only a few minutes had slipped by. He told me all about his \"girlfriend\" Ocean, at least that's what think he said her name was, about the fight he got into with JoJo, his half sister, about getting in trouble at home and at school and on and on and on and on he went. His rant about his day seemed to just draw you in. After an eternity in the void that was my son's rambling I heard Lars shout, \"hey the fuck\", before I shot across the dock at him, chains whipping off of my feet and easily bounding around his wrists. The other two goons were already doubling over, the wind knocked out of them with a well placed shot to their solar plexus. \"Sorry Vagabond, looks like I finally outsmarted you\". \"What the fuck happened, we still have 10 minuets left, how do you have speed and strength\". \"See Lars, on Tuesdays, I do have a power, not that anyone will ever believe you about any of my powers\", Lars stared at me like he wanted to carve my face off, which he probably did, \"nor do I think they'll believe that someone other then me has any powers\", I shook the phone at him, my son's voice still going on about his day. \"Hey buddy, looks like I'll be making it home for tacos after all.\" The sounds of my son's cheers echoed off the water. <Germanpunkynerd>: Nice read, but taco Tuesday would probably start before midnight. And the kid would be in bed. <Technogen>: Mark it down as a code word for them. He calls says random stuff and saying he wont make it home for Taco Tuesday and it lets his wife know that he's in a bind.<snd_me_tacos>: That's the meaning I got<Zenog400>: Wait a minute... your username...<NickDHaten>: Oh fuk<Katman08>: #Oh fuk<MOBIMANZ>: # Ohhhh fuk", "num_messages": 9, "avg_score": 388.6666666667}

However...destiny has somehow given and connected you to the only angel not belonging to heaven, Lucifer himself. <SirLemoncakes>: Everyone has a guardian angel. Someone upstairs assigns one to each and every person at birth. They keep you safe from supernatural threats from the simple poltergeist, to the nefarious demon. They aren't always successful, but they try. Guardian angel contracts aren't usually exclusive. There simply wouldn't be enough angels in heaven to meet demand. So cherubs will take a handful of humans, principalities watch over a couple thousand, seraphs are even capable of protecting millions at any given time. Then there are the Archangels; they watch over entire countries. Most people barely ever have cause to notice their guardian angel, heck most angels have little cause to notice their wards. I certainly noticed my guardian. From the time I was an infant, horrible things seemed to happen all around me. Oh, nothing bad happened to me, but people around me weren't so fortunate. I was thirteen years old the first time it happened. Some sixteen year old punk was following me as I walked home from school. He flicked me, called me homophobic names, and even started to smack me on the back of the head. I was so angry, so irritated. I just wanted him to stop. He stopped. I remember waiting for the next blow to fall, the next mean spirited remark to land, when nothing happened. I turned to see my tormentor. He was staring in abject horror at his hands. They were absolutely covered in thick, wriggling maggots. He screamed and ran away. I didn't realize the significance of the event at the time. I guess I assumed that some spirit or entity had overwhelmed his angel, and he had been attacked. Excellent timing, but nothing to worry about. That's when it all started and it only got worse from there. If someone called me a bad name, they would find themselves being chased off by a spider the size of a great Dane. If my sister stole one of my CD's, her toys would bubble and melt into a puddle of plastic. Imagine growing up with everyone you loved fearing you. Hating you. I never knew my Father, he left my Mother when I was born. She never talks about him. I was sure that I'd driven him off with whatever curse haunted me. People who knew my father said I had his eyes. Like hammered gold they said. I hated my eyes, just one more thing that made me stand out. I grew up bitter. I grew up isolated. The angel on my shoulder didn't make the distinction between a friend making jibes, and a hated enemy making threats. I had few friends, and plentiful enemies. I was nearing my twentieth birthday when I began to hear whispers. Enticements promising revenge. Promising power. Promising love. With the voice's urging, I began to exercise, socialize, I learned to be charismatic. I learned to manipulate the bastards who had scorned me for so very long. I flexed social muscles which I'd hardly known I had. By my twenty-fifth birthday, I was running for government. I was polling extremely well, my somewhat troubled past only serving to improve my public image. I was a man reformed, a pariah who worked his way back into the social community. People hailed me as the visionary who would guide the world into a new era. Oh how right they were. The voice guided me through the webs of the political world. Gave me leverage on my political rivals. Was the friend to me I had always needed. I finally met my guardian angel just last night. He was magnificent. I had seen paintings of Michael, Gabriel, Cassiel, the whole lot of the most beautiful of heaven's host. They paled in comparison to the being which watched over me. Lucifer. He stood eight feet tall, his wings were the purist white, a soft glow of radiance surrounded him. His eyes looked like beaten gold. I knew who he was. I knew why he had been helping me for so long. My Father, Lucifer. ********************** /r/SirLemoncakes<milo159>: predictable, but i suppose that's unavoidable given this prompt. Very good all the same.<SirLemoncakes>: Yeah, I agree. That being said, not every story needs an unexpected twist. <milo159>: Absolutely.

Not for lack of trying in high school and college. He delved into many worlds and subcultures, trying to find himself and who he was. But after it was all said and done he entered the corporate world and became about as average as anyone else. His job title was brand representative and he worked for an up and coming soft drink company. The drink, frankly, tasted of pure sugar but boasted itself as being \u201call natural\u201d and so had quite a following. It was a sunny Saturday in Midtown and he was manning a tent at a local festival, handing out samples and merchandise. He wore his work smile, chatted with people who passed by, handing out cans and bottles and keychains and stickers. It wasn\u2019t until he saw her and his day was turned on it\u2019s head. Dalia was tall, slightly taller than Darren, and had chestnut brown hair that she wore long. Her eyes were heterochromatic, with one being hazel and the other a deep brown. Her lips were painted a deep red and her teeth were pearlescent white. Within moments of talking with her, Darren was smitten, and for reasons he still can\u2019t explain, he left the booth and his job entirely to spend time with her. The two became fast friends, and shortly after that they became lovers. Darren was as of now working from home; or rather, from Dalia\u2019s as they moved in together soon after sleeping together. She had a power over him he didn\u2019t quite understand. He had no idea what she did for a living, but she was very active in many ways, and her home spoke of the possibility of wealth. She like gardening and grew many familiar and strange plants. She was very literate and had two massive bookshelves filled with books in many languages, and of course she could read them all. In many ways Darren felt she was out of his league, but her affections (both emotional and physical) proved she loved him. When it came down to it, Darren was ready to propose. But when the day came, before she could say yes, Darren had to accept a certain caveat. Dalia was indeed from money. She came from a very successful family lineage that Darren had never heard of before. Dalias many talents and interests culminated into one key focus: Magic. And her family was one of oldest magical families around. So old in fact, that her father was not only the head of the family, but also the figurehead of all dark power on Earth. If he was to marry Dalia, then he would have to succeed her father. One does not ask the Dark Lord for his daughters hand in marriage though. Especially not some mortal without a lick of magic in his veins. He could challenge her older brother and if he bested him, then he would have won her hand. But her brother was just as powerful as her father, and Darren was likely to lose the fight and his life. And so Dalia proposed a compromise. Her father, while an accomplished magician in many fields, specialized as a necromancer. A style of magic so complex that one misstep could mean losing a limb, your life, or your sanity. \u201cWhen a person is brought back to life, there is a chance to change everything about them. Think of it as rebirth. A man dies\u2014a man who has never played an instrument in his life\u2014and you bring him back able to play the piano as though he\u2019d spent his whole life doing it.\u201d \u201cDarren,\u201d Dalia cooed, stroking his hair, \u201cI could bring you back, and make you just as powerful as my father and my brother. They couldn\u2019t deny you then.\u201d \u201cBut to be brought back I have to\u2014\u201c \u201cDie. Yes. But it won\u2019t be long. It\u2019ll be as though you went to sleep. When you wake up, you\u2019ll understand your power. So Darren, my love, would you do this for me? For us?\u201d Before he could respond she kissed him. Her lips melted into his and he was putty in her hands. They made love and all the while she whispered into his ear. She whispered words of passion and pleasure, of fantasy and things to be. She stroked his hair and body and ego, and when it was all said and done he laid in bed exhausted. She sat perched above him, nude with a dagger held high above his chest. \u201cI love you,\u201d Darren said just before he felt the impact of the blade, and his world went black. Darren has no memory of what happened afterwards. Only an all consuming cold darkness, followed by his coronation to the throne. He did understand his power, as now he had much of it. Apparently he used it to usurp the throne and he took Dalia as his Queen. He had killed her father and brother, and rather than mourn their loss she rejoiced in his victory. In her victory. For Darren understood what had happened. He knew what he had become. Yes, he was the Dark Lord, but he was no real king. Only a figurehead and puppet for the new matriarch. <edit>: Obligatory thanks for the gold and thank you for everyone reading! <KnightRyze>: Wait that ending was wayyyy to sudden. Was the entire love bit a lie? Is she now some cruel sociopathic dominatrix? Is he now completely under her control? Does she view him as a puppet and nothing wrong? Was the entire ploy some a powerplay, or was it the \"only way they could be together\"? So much is left unexplained.<Blu3b3Rr1>: She made him her consort/lover while she actually did the ruling behind the scenes<laughmaker_son>: Over all I was writing a short story so if the ending comes off abrupt I apologize. I\u2019m working on writing short stories more efficiently, so perhaps I can work on my ending and details. Some of it I wanted left open to interpretation. In my mind Darren and Daria do love each other and it is definitely a sub/dom take. Maybe Daria used some charm magic here and there, maybe she never really needed to. Darren is aware he\u2019s a puppet of sorts, and isn\u2019t without his liberties because unless Daria says other wise he\u2019s \u201cfree.\u201d <Edit>: also, I really am looking to break more into my fiction writing and if you check my history I\u2019m on here most everyday. Some of my stuff is a little janky because I mostly type though mobil on my break, but I got a laptop now so I\u2019ll start working more from there. If anyone has any criticism, advice, etc. I very much welcome it. And for those asking for a sequel, I have a bad habit of not following through with them. I do have a sub /r/laughingwriter where I\u2019ll do continuations. My goal is to compile my work into good short stories, and eventually began a short novel. Thanks to everyone who read it! It really makes my day knowing people read what I write, whether the upvotes come or not. <regionalphilbin>: I think it was a good short story. I think the original criticism was probably because we all have a different concept of what happened in the middle, and humans want certainty. Many of us read the books, if we liked the movie. Many of us read multiple news sources from multiple slants. Most humans want to know the whole story. The whole middle of this story, is left to our imagination. I think you have a pretty good story in the making, if you tell us the details. The beginning is solid. The end is solid, but the devil is in the details. <laughmaker_son>: Thanks! That\u2019s a great perspective. So I need to work adding details but keeping the brevity of a short story. I\u2019ll work on my \u201cmiddle.\u201d That seems to be the trickiest after all. I appreciate you taking the time to leave me the comment.<tBrenna>: I love the stories that leave some room for ambiguity, but agree that the middle felt... rushed? Like there wasn\u2019t enough to get a sense of their relationship. An extra sentence here and there to solidify that aspect could really be helpful. Mostly for Delia since she\u2019s the unknown magic user that kills the main character to take power for herself. You mentioning that they are in love, really makes that clear to me as before that I wasn\u2019t sure if I was supposed to uncertain or not.", "num_messages": 8, "avg_score": 1450.5}

I sighed and turned back to the computer. My balance was still staring at me on the screen, taunting me. I knew I was going to have to call the bank to double check, though part of me wanted to just coast on it and see how long I could ride it out before someone caught me. But come on. I was a mostly-broke college kid. I could barely afford rent and groceries, much less college and book costs. My normal deposits were in the thousand of dollar ranges. Singular. So someone somewhere is probably going to notice when half a million dollars just randomly shows up in this kid\u2019s account, don\u2019t you think? I shook my head. Nope, just wasn\u2019t going to do it. Ok, maybe just a little. I\u2019d use it to buy more food and cover the moron\u2019s part of the rent, just so we didn\u2019t get kicked out this month.

The best I could come up with? \u201cUh, what?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re broke. You live with a moron who steals your shit and won\u2019t pay his part.

Darren didn\u2019t even look up. \u201cWhoever it is, go away, we ain\u2019t home.\u201d The knock came again, louder this time, and he looked at me. \u201cDude, aren\u2019t you going to go get the damn door?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d I motioned to his cheddar-covered hands. \u201cYou ate my chips, you can get the damn door.\u201d \u201cJerk.\u201d Darren flipped me off again and got up, spilling chips everywhere. He made his way to the door, where whomever was behind the door was still knocking. \u201cKeep your damn shirt on!

Darren, for his part, went limp and offered no resistance, none of his usual gruff demeanor. I watched in amazement as they nodded at me in greeting, pulled Darren out the door, and closed the door behind them. I turned back to the computer and typed rapidly. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d \u201cDarren was a criminal. I won\u2019t clue you in on his exact crime, but it was\u2026 ugh. Rather disgusting. Needless to say, when I reported his whereabouts, I made sure they were aware you had absolutely nothing to do with his\u2026 activities.\u201d \u201cWhat in the world did he do?\u201d \u201cVideos.\u201d \u201cVideos.\u201d \u201cNot good ones.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I blinked. \u201c\u2026 Oh! Oh, um, enough said.\u201d \u201cThank you. I didn\u2019t want to have to go there.\u201d I shuddered. After a moment, I continued typing, \u201cYou said a third thing?\u201d \u2018Indeed I did. They should be there in a minute or thr\u2026\u201d There was a knock on the door, followed by a loud voice that said, \u201cPizza!\u201d I don\u2019t think I made but more than two steps between my laptop and the door to my apartment. That door was open and the pizza inside before you could say \u201cJumping Jack Flash\u201d three times flat. And when I found out it was already paid for, it tasted even sweeter. After three pieces of pie vanished, I remembered my strange benefactor and moved back to the laptop. Wiping the grease off on my shorts, I typed, \u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d \u201cWhy me?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll see one day. For now, until we call, enjoy it.\u201d \u201cWait. Until we call? What happens then?\u201d There was no answer. I stared at the screen for hours, that last sentence taking all the joy out of everything that had happened over the last fifteen minutes. Well, mostly stared at the screen. Ok, that\u2019s a bald-faced lie. I ate pizza, played video games on my television without having to worry about Darren coming in and monopolizing the TV; it WAS his TV after all, though I doubt he was coming back for it\u2026 and planning what I was going to do with my new money. I was going to enjoy the absolute crap out of myself. Until they call. Then we\u2019d see what happens next.<DeathByAutoscroll>: Damn. Well written and I love the fact that the hacker found and presented evidence of darren's videos to the police. <mattswritingaccount>: I initially had what the videos WERE, but took that out to leave it part of the imagination.

I like doing that, it makes them uneasy. My mistress would have called it a result of my sociopath tendencies. God I miss that bitch. Mr. Stevens looked at me warily from the other side of the massive oak desk between us. He looked uncomfortable in his rickety old chair. The oiled leather in my chair fit me perfectly, which it should given that it costed unreasonable amounts. \"So...errr\" he started. I flipped my papers, pretending to browse through them. He closed his lips and looked down. A few minutes passed, the only sound being his uncomfortable shuffling. He was getting used to it now. It was time to strike. I looked up from my papers and bored my eyes into his. They were a drunkard's old eyes, in a face marred by a hard life. He almost fell from his chair in surprise. \"So Mr. Stevens. First of all I would like to welcome you to my office. As you know we pride ourselves on giving the best advice available. \"but aren't you the only adv...\" \"the best advice available mr.

That's why you are here to begin with, after all\". I clicked my pen once more for good measure. I swear the sound almost sent him reeling. His suffering was sweet nectar. \"And I see here that you stole.... a penguin?\" \"Ah\" He didn't object to this one, he just looked embarrassed. \"Well, that isn't theft. Genesis 1:26 clearly states that man is to rule over the animals after all. If you wanted the penguin to come home with you, that is your prerogative.\" He gave me a dubious stare. \"False witness is a tricky one, and I see that this really was one of your specialties\" \"Now hold on a m...\" \"Forty-three thousand six hundred and eighty-eight counts to be exact\" He looked dumbfounded. \"But I also see that you clearly regretted lying most of the time\" A glimmer of hope appeared in his eyes. \"So we'll claim repentance. It worked for St. Peter after all, so they tend to be lenient about that one at the gates\". \"So that leaves us with taking the lord's name in vain\" \"Jesus Ch...\" I looked at him. \"Oh\" he said. \"We'll just file a claim that the Tetragrammaton can't really be pronounced.

He gave me a doubtful look while I stood up and started walking him to the door. \"Just you go on mr. Stevens. They'll let you in.\". I opened the door and let him out. \"I mean, I think you are perfect for heaven. You're just the kind of guy I want there. If they don' let you in...\" I closed the door behind him and smiled at the mirror besides it. The red flaming eyes were quite unlike the blue ones mr. Stevens had seen. \"...

It\u2019s a neat party trick, I\u2019m not going to lie.\u201d \u201cWell, let\u2019s see it then,\u201d Gwen said. She crossed her arms in front of her. She didn\u2019t believe me. \u201cGive me something to find,\u201d I said. \u201cMy will to live,\u201d Lance joked. Gwen snorted and he handed her a red solo cup. The liquor was so strong the smell burnt *my* nose. I rolled my eyes. \u201cHow many times are you gonna make that joke?\u201d \u201cUntil people stop laughing.\u201d Gwen looked between me and Lance. She didn\u2019t even flinch as she took a drink. \u201cIs this something you do everytime one of the guys has a new girlfriend? Try and make her look dumb?\u201d Despite her accusation, she was still having a good laugh. Maybe Lance had finally found a keeper. \u201cHe\u2019s being serious, actually. Comes in handy.\u201d Lance sipped his own drink. The music rose - someone had cranked the volume. He leaned into Gwen and yelled in her ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s something you\u2019re looking for?\u201d \u201cA million dollars,\u201d she smirked. \u201cNot that either. Something *specific*,\u201d I laughed and sipped the beer I had been nursing the better part of the night. There was still a good third of the cup left, now warm and flat. \u201cA room for those two,\u201d Lance gestured at Tristan and Izzy, who were drunkenly making out in the dark corner of his living room. He scrunched his nose as he remembered *his* room was the nearest. \u201cOn second thought, maybe not.\u201d Gwen locked her eyes on me. \u201cFind that boy who went missing last week. Logan Thompson, nine years old, last seen leaving his school with his father.\u201d I frowned at the request. \u201cDoesn\u2019t work for people. Believe me, I\u2019ve tried.\u201d Gwen shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re lying to me,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m making myself look like an idiot.\u201d \u201cNo, it real, I promise.\u201d \u201cOkay. Find the Holy Grail.\u201d Lance\u2019s laugh turned to cough as the rum and coke caught in his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s a good one,\u201d he wheezed, \u201cI\u2019m using it next time you pull this shit at a party to look impressive.\u201d I laughed too. Maybe everyone was too drunk for the trick tonight. \u201cShit.\u201d I dropped the warm beer over Lance\u2019s carpet. \u201cHey, what the hell -\u201d I could see it. A faint glow hovered in front of my eyes. It bounced for a second, then traced a path out the front door and up the street. \u201cThe Holy Grail is five and a half miles southeast of here.\u201d \u201cStop fucking around man,\u201d Lance said. He dabbed at the damp carpet with a wad of paper towel. Gwen reached down to help. I grabbed his wrist and met his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m serious. I wouldn\u2019t joke about this.\u201d Lance paused for a minute. He left the wet splotch on the carpet alone and stood up. \u201cYou sure?\u201d \u201cPositive.\u201d \u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered to himself. He turned across the room. \u201cHey Arty?\u201d Arty turned around, looking annoyed his attention was drawn away from the pretty brunette. \u201cWhat?\u201d Lance pushed his way across the room. Gwen and I followed in the wake he cleared. \u201cYou\u2019re not drinking tonight, right? You were gonna drive home?\u201d Arty huffed. \u201cWell, yeah, but I don\u2019t see what this has to do with -\u201d \u201cGrab your keys,\u201d Lance told him. \u201cMartin here thinks he knows where the Holy Grail is. We\u2019re going.\u201d \u201cAnd what? You expect me to lead you into this?\u201d \u201cPretty much, yeah.\u201d Lance grinned and turned to Gwen and me. \u201cLet\u2019s go find that cup.\u201d --- /r/liswrites<LisWrites>: *Part 2* \u201cSeatbelts.\u201d \u201cWhat? Arty, we don\u2019t have time -\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my car. You asked me - well, you *told* me, but still. Wear a seatbelt.\u201d Lance slammed the buckle in aggressively. \u201cYou happy?\u201d \u201cVery,\u201d Arty said. He shifted the car into gear and pulled away from Lance\u2019s rented basement suite. The frost formed against the windows of Arthur\u2019s car, but his engine started without a problem. Probably why Lance asked him in the first place - his old beater took three tries to start and didn\u2019t like to run any time the weather dipped below -15. Lance took the bus most days. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking with me, right?\u201d Gwen asked again, for good measure. \u201cHow the hell would the Holy Grail end up in the middle of Canada?\u201d She really did have a point. \u201cI have no idea. But, no, we aren\u2019t messing with you. Lance worries enough about his place when he\u2019s actually *there*. He wouldn\u2019t be here unless it was real,\u201d I said. He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m probably gonna lose my security deposit so this better make up for it.\u201d Gwen laughed. I could see her in the rearview. She leaned against Lance and nestled her head into the nook of his shoulder. Arty tightened his grip and jerked his eyes forward. He had been looking in the mirror too. *Great*. It wasn\u2019t Lance\u2019s fault. Arty never told anyone he liked Gwen. Well, anyone besides me. I hardly needed anything else to deal with at the moment. \u201cTake the next left,\u201d I told him. He nodded. I paused. \u201cWhat the fuck are we gonna do with the Holy Grail?\u201d No one answered. The question hung in the air until Gwen burst out laughing. Lance followed, then me, then Arty. We were crying, doubled over in on ourselves. \u201cI think I\u2019ll put it on my shelf,\u201d Lance said, \u201cwe can bring it out the next time we have a party.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll put it out next time my mom comes around for dinner,\u201d I added. Arty cracked up. \u201cUse it in beer pong.\u201d He swung left. \u201cPull over,\u201d I said. We got out of the car. We had been to the park a few times before. Last summer we played slo-pitch on the diamond behind us. Before Morgan dumped me, we had biked along the trees and river. A gust of wind picked up the snow from the field and tossed it over us. Gwen shivered. Even Arty swore at the bitterness. My nose ran, but I didn\u2019t care. \u201cThis way,\u201d I called. We made our way through the dusty snow to the frozen bank of the river. \u201cShit.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I kicked at the edge. The ice didn\u2019t crack under my boot. Not even a splinter raced outward underfoot. \u201cIt\u2019s underwater.\u201d Arty said. He wasn\u2019t guessing. He was staring at a spot, about a quarter of the way across the river. \u201cYou can see it?\u201d Lance asked. Arthur raised his eyebrow. \u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d Gwen shivered and cozied up to Lance. \u201cWell, no one\u2019s found it for two-thousand years,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are the chances it\u2019ll be snapped up by morning? We could come back with some real winter clothes. My dad used to icefish. I could bring his drill.\u201d The cold had sobered her up. Everyone looked at me. I shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s not wrong. We have absolutely no way to get it.\u201d \u201cAnd what if it\u2019s gone?\u201d Lance asked. \u201cWhat if that\u2019s the reason no one\u2019s ever gotten it? We shouldn\u2019t let our eyes off it.\u201d Arty dug his hands into his pockets. He didn\u2019t have a pleasant buzz that kept the cold off him. \u201cHow are we getting through that ice? We\u2019re gonna need to find the sword in the fucking stone next.\u201d I froze. Lance and Arty kept chirping at each other. \u201cGuys?\u201d I said. \u201cYeah?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re never going to believe what\u2019s in the trees on the other side of the river.\u201d <KuriousityKilledKat>: It took me nearly until the end of part two to realize that the characters' names were relevant. <Edit>: I don't care if no one likes when people say this, this is my first reddit silver.

Since then, you've become much happier and have found yourself in a better place. This morning, you woke up with a text from an unknown number on your phone: \"It's done.\" <WPWinter>: You blinked, scanning your phone's messaging app. 'It's done' was the only message that was sent from that unknown number. What was done? You don't remember ordering any services recently, unless it was about the maintenance on your car. You flipped your phone over and over in your palm as you tried to figure out this mystery. Did you order something last night? You can't remember. You frowned; it sounded awfully like something out of a mafia movie- You froze. Oh. *Oh.* \"Fuck,\" you say into the empty house. Didn't someone say that the sins of the past could come to haunt you in the present or something like that? You thought that it was some made up junk, but now? *Fuck.* \"I really hate you, past me,\" you groan. You sank down into one of your sofas and you cradle your head in your hands, a headache forming in-between your eyes. It'd been years since those dark days, where everything seemed to had been going wrong. Where every single waking moment to get out of bed was a struggle in of itself. And you must have been ether supremely drunk and welling up with despair that you decided to commit suicide in the most roundabout way possible. The doorbell rang, taking you out of your thoughts. You could hear your heart hammering in your chest. 'It's okay. Play it cool,' you remind yourself, as you slowly inch towards the door. \"Hello?\" you call out. \"Er, hey...!\" a feminine voice called out your name, and you take a sigh of relief. \"It's me, Erika. Is everything okay?\" No, everything was *not* okay. This was so not cash money... \"I'm fine!\" you holler. \"Can I come inside?\" she asked in a soft voice. \"I, ah, I have something to talk to you about...\" Well that doesn't sound good. You were inches away from the door now, and you pull the blinds just far enough on your door's window to peer out at them. Her aqua-blue eyes blinked back at you behind her glasses. \"Er...\" she called your name again. \"Are you okay? You look really pale...\" \"No,\" you shake your head, taking in a breath of air through your nose. \"I'm fine. Lemme get the door for you,\" you say, your clammy hands falling to the doorknob. You pull the door open, and she stepped inside. You let out a breath of air. They way she seemed to relax as well put you at ease for some reason. You shook your head. Erika had never let you down before; she'd been your oldest and best friend. You doubt that she'd let you down now. -- &gt; Part 1 / ??? <WPWinter>: You shut the door behind her and lock it for good measure. \"Make yourself at home,\" you say, pulling the blinds closed. Behind you, you could hear the muffled *thunk* of her taking her boots off. You mulled over telling her about the hitman. If only because your life was going to be cut tragically short because of a mistake you made half a decade ago. You let out a sigh. What the hell were you thinking that day? \"Hey,\" she said, and you turned around to look at her. \"You're worrying about something, aren't you?\" she asked. And for some reason, you could've sworn she had a guilty look on her face. You looked down at her hands to find her wringing them. You frown and take her hands into yours. ... You tried to ignore how soft and warm they felt in yours, and how the weight that settled over your heart seemed to lighten. \"Yeah, I-\" you sigh. \"I'm worrying about something big. Can-Can we sit down? Go into the living room?\" you ask. She nods, and the two of you sit down in the sofa. \"I'm sorry,\" she says before you could say anything. Your eyes dart to her face, and if anything she looked more miserable. \"Why are you sorry?\" you ask. And of all of the responses you were expecting, a tired, self-depreciating chuckle was probably the last thing you were prepared for. \"The text? I sent it as a joke, but I didn't think that you would take it this seriously.\" Wait, what? She meets your eyes, and the aqua-blue irises shimmered in the light. \"H-Hey, Erika,\" you say as she turned her head to look at the carpet instead, \"What are you talking about?\" \"The text? You ordered a hit on yourself five years ago. Don't you remember that?\" she asked. You flinched. \"... Yeah,\" you say quietly. \"What's... this about?\" Her lips quirked upward into a sad smile. \"Well, you, uhm, asked me to take you out.\" She kept on looking at the floor. \"... You're the hitman?\" you asked. She nodded. \"Five years ago, when I showed up at the address you sent me, *your* address, and I was lining up the shot... I realized that you ordered the hit on yourself.\" She squeezed your hands, and you realized you had never let go of her hands since the moment you confessed what was on your mind to her. And for some reason you didn't mind that you were holding hers. \"... And I knew I couldn't take your life.\" She turned her head to meet your gaze, and her eyes were shimmering with unshed tears. \"So I decided to save it.\" And then the realization hit you harder than a speeding car. A week after you remember placing the phone call, a young eighteen year old showed up on your front porch and asked if you wanted to see her gun collection. \"... So you befriended me?\" you ask slowly. She gave a short jerk of her head, and you let out a breath of air you didn't realize you were holding. \"... So you're not going to kill me,\" you say. She furiously shook her head, sending her chocolate brown hair flying in every single direction. You close your eyes as you relax, the adrenaline leaving your body. You *weren't* going to die. Wait. \"What *was* that text about it being done about, Erika?\" you ask. Silence met your ears, and you crack your eyes open to look in her direction. She was still looking away from you, but you swear that her cheeks were beginning to turn red. \"Erika?\" you ask. \"Well...!\" she squeaked. \"It-uh-do you remember the exact wording you used when you ordered the hit on yourself?\" she asked. Yeah. \"I wanted to take me out...?\" you say, and she nodded. What was this about? \"Well... since I already said I wasn't gonna kill you... how about a date instead?\" You let out a loud laugh, and she turned to give you the strongest pout she could muster. \"With that kinda pick up line, how could I refuse?\" you say. *** And that was how you met your wife. &gt;Part 2/2<BunnehZnipr>: Her intro though. 18 year old girl showing up randomly at his appartment, and the first thing she asks is if he wants to see her gun collection.

Humans are an oddity in that we produce it naturally in our bodies. <WrittenThought>: The sky turned black with alien crafts. They shifted like clouds in lazy formations, and the people of Earth responded by gawking from their windows. It had taken two weeks from the start of Liam Brent's business venture to start of an intergalactic incident. Every news channel in the world had a live feed of the same hulking fleet. Scrolling text and news anchors speculated about the invader's purpose. Liam Brent was the common theme. *-It is believed that the vast number of ships is a show of force. Analysts are working on identifying the crafts, but early reports believe them to be of the Stargonic Police Force. This may be the incident we need for the government to tackle business' manoeuvring the slow lawmaking process.* People had *wanted* to believe that the invasion was about law and order. That Liam Brent's intergalactic adrenaline business had upset an all-powerful galactic body - and it had, but not a lawful one. The cocktail of a highly illegal substance that until recently had been impossible to produce, and an Earth seller claiming to have an abundance, mixed to create a drink that comes with a guaranteed cough, and pause when drinking - *is this good for me?* A messenger craft detached from the main body and ignoring the Earth's feeble defences. It dived straight to Liam Brent's mountain home and compounded the initial speculation of a regulatory force. The craft had barely touched the ground when it returned to the horde, and Brent's security detail reported him abducted. The absurdly wealthy intergalactic drug dealer had been picked from the planet like a scab, and even his family struggled to mourn the loss - having by default inherited his wealth. A fringe group labelled conspiracy theorists believed the show of force had been about more than justice. Hours after Brent's abduction, their crazy theories became a reality. An exert from Damien L's social media feed one hour after the alien force's arrival (14/12/29 10:32:22): *They have come to farm us. We are too naive as a species to trade with the big vast galaxy. Our production of adrenaline poses a threat to all existing traders, and to put it in terms everyone will understand. There will be a hostile take over.* Damien will go down in history, but how that history looks is vastly different. A secondary wave came, they split like capitol-city-seeking missiles. And so began the infrastructure. Structures the size of towns were erected in *hours*. And with Liam's guidance, the aliens constructed fear factories. Industrial buildings designed to evoke adrenaline in any living person they could capture. Many wondered if this was just an upscaled version of Liam Brent's prior business plan. The fringe, those that saw this coming, have taken to the underground. Living in fear of the foreign force - who showed no signs of leaving. Reconnaissance missions were conducted every three months, and with each, they recognised less and less of their Earth.

Everyone panics when, millennia later, Humanity comes out of an area of space long fought dead. <Yarroborray>: It turns out that Mother Earth was not where it all began. For decades humanity had wondered of the possibility of other life amongst the stars. Expeditions were sent to planets within our galaxy, telescopes mapped and tracked the stars, and equipment worldwide constantly listened to anything and everything that came from outer space, all in search for the answer to a single question. Are we alone? Leading scientists had theorized that there was some significant step or hurdle that kept a species from evolving and exploring past a certain point. They called this point the great barrier, and posited that we were either past it and the first to evolve this far, or approaching it and therefor doomed. As it turns out, it was neither. Our first clues as to our reality came after we had developed a means of traveling between the stars. At first we found nothing, just orbs of gas and chunks of rock drifting through space, devoid of life. At first. The further Humanity explored the more eager we became to go further. To conquer. All that we found we considered ours, and why not? We had still not yet discovered evidence that there were any other intelligent races with whom we shared the vast expanse of space. And so it was that the further from home our scouts explored, the further from home our colonists settled. We expanded. With all of the grace of a Rose in Spring we bloomed from the small bud of Earth into a great empire spanning many stars. Eventually we found life. Astounded as we were that life did in fact exist outside of ourselves and what we brought with us, so too were we perplexed at the simplicity of the life we encountered. We found planets covered in vegetation, we found planets teeming with small creatures and insects, we found a great diversity that stunned our scientists and awed our citizens, but in and through all of this discovery it was that which we did not find that perplexed us the most. Predators. Life on these planets where we discovered it was simple. Plants grew, tiny animals ate the plants. There were no fangs to fear, no claws to cower from, no roars from which to run away. And so we conquered. One planet after another, we continued to spread until that fateful day. It was not life we discovered this day. It was death. Death in the form of a seemingly great civilization, with not but mossy ruins remaining. Death in the form of great monuments, falling prey to time and erosion. Death in the form of historical records, depicting the mighty species that once was. Death, in the form of our ancestors. One after another, we discovered the ruins and records of Human civilizations, of a vast galactic empire that once was, but now was nothing but ash and bone. The more ancient records we translated, the more emotional we became. We felt joy and sadness, fear and regret, but there was one emotion that we all felt as one, an emotion so immense that it dominated all other thought and led us down the path we find ourselves on today. We felt anger. Among the documents we deciphered, we discovered that Humanity had once before conquered the stars. We realized that from Earth there was a reason we could not detect any signs of life. Life in our corner of space had long been fought to death. Some other race had opposed our ancestors, and eliminated species that were dear to us one after another. Evidence of a Great War was pieced together as we explored more worlds, and eventually we found the most damning document of all. The record of our exile. Humans were defeated by an alliance of other species and together they forced us away from our home worlds. They razed to the ground any planets with life within reach of our prison, and sent us off to what many considered the most dangerous planet in the Galaxy; Earth. But Earth we conquered. Against the bitter cold, the blazing heat, the massive predators we survived. We survived, we thrived, and we escaped. Now, having expanded once more to a mere fraction of our former glory, we found ourselves angry. Colonists all around the Rim bayed for blood, and so it was that the single greatest militarization of the Human species to ever occur was wrought. From the dead and cold ashes of our ancestors we rose once again, a blazing Phoenix in the sky over which we spread our wings, soaring toward the horizon that was our destiny. Revenge wouldn\u2019t be enough. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 This one I dedicate to u/LiquidBeagle -Yarro <Edit>: Thank you for the silver, kind stranger!

Can't imagine the can of whoop-ass they're about to pop open on the rest of the galaxy!<Yarroborray>: Glad you liked it Beagle :-) The prompt might have called for a point of view from those that sent the Humans to Earth, but I saw a great opportunity to paint a picture of what we saw as we expanded, and how it tied in to our \u2018history\u2019. Though, writing a story of the all conquering Human race finally going to war might have been fun too.<LiquidBeagle>: As the great Captain Barbosa would say, the prompts are more like guidelines than actual rules.

I\u2019ll make a deal with you. I\u2019m not looking to karma whore with my prompts, so there will be two sides to this. If my story reaches 100 upvotes by this time tomorrow, I\u2019ll write a part two. If it does not, you write a part two :-) Do you accept?<LiquidBeagle>: I counter your deal with a deal of my own: How about I write part 2 from the perspective of the other races who exiled humanity, and we go back and forth from there and see how this war plays out? *Your move*... Well, *my move*, if you accept.... <Yarroborray>: \u201cWhat does that siren mean?\u201d \u201cWar were declared\u201d. Challenge accepted my friend.

You call in the royal historian who is quite hesitant to explain how it began. Upon threat of torture they finally begin the tale. <Billingsly>: The war was over\u2013small comfort for the millions of dead, lying in their graves beyond the fortress walls, or the tens of millions more who wept for their fathers, mothers, daughters and sons. The war had touched everyone and left them scarred myself, included, but as my late grandmother was fond of saying, \u2018let bygones be bygones\u2019. She wasn\u2019t a very creative woman, but the old cliche rang true. Indeed the spirit of that old saying seemed to fillI the great hall as bustling bodies, mostly intact, swirled together for the first time in over a century. I saw the dour blue of the Eurasian Confederacy mingling with the olive green of the Mercian Coalition and many others coalesce into loose knots, chattering excitedly about this new and marvelous age. None seemed to mind the hastily repaired floor, still pocked with bullet holes and at least one large crater, lamely hidden under a threadbare carpet. I watched them from afar, safe in my elevated position behind the main negotiating table. It was an old, oak table, with it\u2019s age showing in the many divots and scratches the wax and stain couldn\u2019t hide. Maps and drinks were scattered across it, alongside the pens and tablets that lesser functionaries poked and prodded to seem like they were doing something\u2013they weren\u2019t. In spite of all the excitement, and my best efforts the negotiations had reached a standstill. Neither side was willing to proceed until it was determined who had struck first. An idiotic point of pride, but one which both had stuck to like petulant children. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d I asked my own aide, Alexander. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, Sir\u201d he said, glancing nervously at his wrist. \u201cYou called her over an hour ago. The natives are getting restless\u2026\u201d I said gesturing to the thronging crowds. \u201cI can try again, though I don\u2019t think it will do much. The Royal Order of Histories didn\u2019t know where she was the last time I called.\u201d Alex muttered. \u201cWell, do something. It\u2019s no good you sitting there looking useless. Makes it seem like a tactic, one which I\u2019m certain the Eurasian bloc will take as an affront to their honor.\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d He said and got back on the phone. I waited drumming my fingers against the tabletop, and took a sip of water. The fine crystal glass, over\u2013baubled, and filled with what I was assured was the last bottle of an ancient burgundy sat untouched. As a rule, I never drank until a deal was signed. I needed a clear head to ensure each side felt they got what they were owed. And despite the jubilant atmosphere, I knew this treaty was dancing dangerously close to the edge of oblivion. One misstep and millions more would die fighting over\u2026what exactly? And that was the problem. No one knew, well none besides those monkish scholars of the ROH. *Where was she?* All at once the air was sucked out of the room. Conversations that had been rattling on for hours, died, as the monolithic door at the other end of the hall swung open on groaning hinges. Trumpets blared from alcoves hidden high above. **\u201cHer honor, Magnate Alicia Deviros, R-O-H!\u201d** The hailers cried. The crowds parted on instinct. A narrow passage opening up in the center of the hall, with each bloc lined up on either side, opposing one another as their fathers, their grandfather's, and their great grandfathers had in the past, obliterating the almost fraternal blending that had existed mere moments before. \u201cShe\u2019s here, Sir\u201d Alexander mumbled into my ear. \u201cI *know* that, stay quiet you idiot. we don't want to do anything that might upset her\u2013unless\u2026absolutely necessary.\u201d I hissed back. \u201cSir,\u201d he nodded, reddening behind his thin mustache. The historian took her time, stopping to greet this envoys, and princelings alike, before she arrived at the table with a bow. The Eurasian Chancellor, grunted, wrinkling his chins and sending the curved horns of his mustache quivering. \u201cFinally\u2026\u201d The historian, gracefully ignored him, instead turning to me, and said, \u201c You wish to know about the origin of the war?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we can proceed\u201d I nodded. \u201cWell I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a rather more delicate tale than these proceedings allow.\u201d \u201cWhat does this mean *too* delicate?\u201d The Chancellor snorted. \u201cI have to concur with the Chancellor,\u201d I deflected, trying to undo any damage the Eurasians rudeness may have caused. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is known to only a few.\u201d \u201cOf course it is, that\u2019s why we called on you and your esteemed colleagues, so that you could\u2026enlighten us, and perhaps put an end to the suffering it\u2019s caused.\u201d \u201cI doubt that.\u201d She said, crossing her arms tight over her chest. \u201cPlease, Ms. Deviros, if you would stop prevaricating, perhaps we could then decide on what is useful information.\u201d The Mercian Senator said. The Chancellor laughed. A good sign, in my experience. It was at least one thing they agreed on. But, the historian said nothing. She just stood there, at the foot of the table. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Alex whispered, leaning over. \u201cIf she won\u2019t tell us, maybe my guards can beat it from her, eh?\u201d The Chancellor roared. And the whole chamber swelled with angry voices, calling for the historian to speak. I stood, pushing my chair back from the table, and held my arms up, palms out, trying to calm to the room and avert disaster. \u201cThe Chancellor is not making idle threats. Would you be more inclined to tell us if it were just the four of us?\u201d I said gesturing to the Senator, and the flustered Eurasian. \u201cWe could go somewhere and speak privately for a while.\u201d The historian, inclined her head, mulling my request over before she, bit her lower lip and sighed. \u201cVery well.\u201d The room was unadorned, and bare. There was no furniture, and if the great empty rectangles in the dust were anything to go by, hadn't been used in a long time. We stood in a loose circle around the historian while she tried to explain to cause of the great war. \u201c\u2026You have to remember that back in those early years of the war, things were different. The Eurasian Confederacy had not yet formed, nor had the Mercians consolidated. The war brought those changes, along with many others\u2013\u201d \u201cI think I speak for everyone,\u201d I said looking around the circle, \u201cwould you please get to the point.\u201d \u201cFine! You all want to know the cause of this interminable conflict? It\u2019s because the President of your country,\u201d She said, pointing at the Mercian Senator, nearly shouting, \u201crefused to kiss your Queens hand.\u201d \u201cAH! I knew it was your bastards fault!\u201d The Chancellor bellowed. \u201cOur fault! Hardly\u2026you launched warheads over a kiss? Lunatics.\u201d Both the Chancellor and the Senators hands went to their ornamental holsters. \u201cIs that all? All of this\u2026was caused by nothing more than a cocktail party faux pas?\u201d I said, stunned. \u201cYes,\u201d Alicia said, looking deflated. \u201cThere was more to it of course, but my studies have traced the growing escalation, and breakdown of diplomatic channels to that one moment in 2035.\u201d \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you wait here for a moment, I\u2019ll be right back\u201d I said and quickly left the room. \u201cAlexander\u201d \u201cSir?\u201d \u201cCall the rest of the diplomatic corp, let them know that the negotiations have become... more complicated.\u201d<aguynamedbry>: Such wonderful details, it was a great read and liked the setting very much.

Tom L told us ages ago that they were about one hundred and sixty meters away. Something about circles and half a metre per person. Maths had never been my strong side, so I just trusted him. I sometimes wondered who they were, the people on the other side. I had heard plenty of stories. War criminals and drug addicts. FBI agents and doctors. One of them found the cure for cancer. Or so we were told. The stories seemed to change as they went around the circle. I had heard from Tom R that a Tom on our side was a magician, but Tom R was a retired librarian and Tom L was a mathematician. If only we could talk to the ones across we could clear it up, but it was impossible to hear anything from just five people away. The void seemed to dampen sounds. &amp;#x200B; The white void hung around us. Had it not been because we were kept here against our will it might be serene. Had it not been for the game it might tolerable. But we were trapped there in an endless loop of sevens and twos, skips and reverses. No one remembered the first move. No one remembered how many rounds we had played. No one had ever played their last card and escaped. &amp;#x200B; \"Three people to go.\" Tom R said, excited. \"Can you do it?\" &amp;#x200B; More than an hour ago I had played my second to last card and said that three letter word that none of us ever thought would be said in this hell.

The patient was a teenager by the name of Tom Dean, though he said he liked to go by Tommy, and nothing seemed to be wrong with him when he first walked into the small clinic the doctor owned. He complained of a headache, and the doctor had gone down his diagnosis checklist as he normally would, ticking boxes of this and that, asking the patient a few questions. From what the doctor had checked, it put Tom on either for a concussion or a brain bleed. &amp;#x200B; This is where he found the issue: Tom didn't play sports, and wasn't the most important, so neither diagnosis made sense. He decided to do a few simple tests, like pressing against various points of the patient's head to see if it hurt him. After finding nothing, the doctor was stumped. Then the doctor realized he hadn't taken blood pressure or heart rate, as the ache could be caused by lack of oxygen to Tommy's brain. He put on his stethoscope and listened for a pulse-listened for almost 30 seconds in absolute silence. Nothing. &amp;#x200B; Figuring it was simply a technical issue, the doctor decided to take blood pressure. He tightened the cuff around the patient's arm and found nothing. Zero. Nada. Cero. It was at this point that the doctor began to become concerned, becoming almost frantic. The teenager didn't seem concerned in the slightest; almost lost in his own thoughts. Now having calmed himself down, the doctor decided he would borrow one of the other doctor's stethoscopes and have them check Tommy's heartbeat. \"Dr. Hartman, would you mind checking this patient's pulse? My stethoscope and BP monitor don't seem to be working!\" \"My pleasure\" was the only response our good doctor got. As Dr. Hartman was checking Tom's pulse, the other doctor inspected his equipment. Nothing seemed to be wrong, and so he got to work searching for the company's telephone number-only to be interrupted. \"Sir! You should come and see this!\" said a suddenly anxious Dr. Hartman. \"Listen\", he told the first doctor.

Unluckily for him, Kevin McCallister hates clowns and will do all he can to stop his attacker. <Jagathor>: \"Why does this always happen to me?\" Kevin McCallister of Winnetka, Illinois was oh so sick of this shit. It's almost as if God just hates him and wants to watch him suffer, but with the time he's had away from his family, he's become prepared for anything. Almost anything. Not this. Anything but this. Once again, Kevin's family has completely disregarded him, now on the other side of the country laughing and enjoying themselves. He was a ghost to them, but he was used to this abuse by now. He knew he was an unwanted child; a mistake. The wall was already built. Justice had been served several times and he was the judge, jury, and executioner. As he peered out the window, waiting for their return, he saw it. He'd always hated clowns, but this one was especially terrifying. It had an energy about it, unlike the previous clown who was a funny guy, just there to amuse him. No, this thing was out in the open, hiding a grin behind a group of balloons. You'd expect that to seem inviting, but it was nothing of the sort. It was coming for him. Kevin's adrenaline shot up, and he returned the grin. \"Fuck you, mom.\" He ran back into the basement, mixed emotions, and grabbed a shovel, two bananas for sustenance, a rope, a white paint bucket, and a double-barreled shotgun, loaded. Oh, he was ready alright. Like second nature, the adrenaline aided him in rigging up a monster, elaborate enough to take down a clown. Just then he heard a knock at the door, then a bang. Another one. Louder, the banging grew until it suddenly stopped. Kevin sat patiently in front of the roaring fireplace, eyeing down the barrel of his shotgun. Dust travelled down into the fire and his grip tightened. Like death, it came crashing down into the fire. Kevin's eyes widened as he watched an enflamed Santa Claus writhe and scream in pain, taking down the house d\u00e9cor with him. He hesitated to pull the trigger, but Santa's alien shrieking convinced him what was real and what wasn't. Blood and guts spilled out of the burning saint's abdomen, and Kevin showed no mercy. The flames reflected off of Kevin's lifeless, sadistic eyes. He turned around to grab the rope, which had already been fastened into a noose, for good measures. As he cautiously approached Kriss Kringle's charred body, he started to laugh like a madman. A murderer. A psychopathic lion eyeballing its next meal. He tied the noose around Santa's neck and hooked it on to the ceiling. Just as he was about to pull it up, the blackened Santa gasped for air. \"Wait!\" He pleaded with a jolly old smile. \"You don't have to do this sonny.\" Kevin showed mercy, just this once, and allowed him to speak. \"You've been a very good boy this year. Don't you want to stay on the nice list?\" Kevin chuckled. \"No. No I haven't.\" He heaved the Santa's body up into the air and watched the life drain from his eyes once again as he choked and gasped for some oxygen. \"Please!\" His voice changed. Something was familiar about it. Kevin walked closer to the hanging body and now saw that it was his mother, hanging on for dear life. \"Kevin, baby. Ple-\" BANG. Blew her head clean off with the final bullet. Blood spurted from her open neck. \"Fuck you, mom.\" Kevin stood there for a moment, admiring the crime scene, and then decided it was time to clean up. So he grabbed the shovel and the body, and walked toward the front door, body draped on his shoulder. As the door creaked open, a clown stood there. The same one from before. Mouth agape. \"Wow.

Grassus didn't answer her call, she was too pure for this world, there was a time when Grassus could think the same way, back when he took care of his first adopted child. Carnilia was her name, it seemed almost a lifetime ago when he had last seen her. Back then it was just as it was right now, except Grassus had lacked the wisdom that only time could grant. He closed his eyes and rested a bit to recall what it was like. Carnilia was a happy child, she always seemed to be amused by anything that Grassus could do. When she was especially young all it took was a small firework display courtesy of Grassus' infernal stomach. As she grew older the sense of wonder and amazement that Carnilia had didn't change. Grassus needed only to do a skydive, or maybe even let her fly atop him. Without fail, Carnilia would give a round of applause and nuzzle Grassus' snout. Those were simpler times, times when Grassus lived in peace. Oh how he wished that he could return to being one- hundred years old. But what a fool he was to think that a dragon could ever live with a human comfortably. *Humans.* The word disgusted him. All humans did was discriminate and destroy. It was not dragons who razed entire cities into smoldering ash, it was the work of men. Dragons much preferred the comfort of a companion who they could share their dangerous talents in a docile manner. Humans weren't the only ones who wanted to live in peace. The girl asked once more, \"why do they hate you?\" Grassus had never met the girl before, but he knew that all it meant was trouble. Just like his first child, just like the other thirty. He had lived for three- thousand years, long enough to see the same vicious cycle play out. It always had to be an innocent young child too. Rarely a boy, but on two occasions it happened. The girl approached and Grassus snapped at her. *If only it ever worked*, Grassus thought. Grassus had no intention of hurting the girl, but with any luck, she would run away screaming. Tears welled up in his massive reptilian eyes and poured out like water from a cauldron- if only they ever did. Of course, this new child would stay. They were too young to see the monster, all they could see was the whimpering lizard, alone on the mountain's peak. The crying didn't do anything to help either, it only added to their sympathy. The new girl came up to nuzzle his snout. An occurrence Grassus had experienced twenty times before. The girl grew confused when the dragon's crying only increased. So she tried to comfort him more. But the dragon withdrew and howled a mighty roar at the girl. Then snapped at her once more, this time more viciously. The feral chomp split the mountain in two, echoing through the valley. But she held fast. Grassus' teeth stood only inches from her face. \"I'm Nora. What can I call you?\" *THE AUDACITY OF THESE CHILDREN I TELL YOU,* Grassus was really tired of this routine. This time it would be the last time. He blew fire down the steep crags of the mountain, dropping boiling acid onto the village at the mountain's foot. He could not fly, he was already too injured. He was going to allow the villagers to have their way. The world was a better place without the tragedy that dragons caused. \"Why?\" She wept. Her tears glistened in the heat of the flames he spewed. \"Don't you know they will kill you? Let's go! Far away where you can be safe.\" Then Grassus spoke, the child did not understand. \"You will live your life the way it was meant to be lived! Insolent child. I have seen your breed before. I have lived for three- thousand years, I know how this ends! Do not try and tell me what will happen. I will tell you this now, go down that mountain and live out your short life to its fullest, forget about me, I am a myth. You are flesh and blood, I am steel and fire. Your heart is being torn between adventure and contentment and the former never ends well.\" Nora nodded, she understood. Then she ran back from whence she came. The villagers met her on the way up shouting words of praise to the girl who 'escaped the dragon's claws'. Grassus didn't think she would give up that easily. Now he was going to die alone. A slow and painful death. The villagers would come with their crossbows and spears to torment him for the next two hours, until he fell from exhaustion. It was fine with Grassus, he was the one who set the city on fire, he was the one who saved that girl. *Nora my last child. I only held you at your birth, but I know that you will be a great women who bears great children.* Grassus coiled himself into a comfortable position and slept. He did not wake up.<LadyLuna21>: I love it! Thank you for the response!", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 9.3333333333}

That's not an observation, it's a law. She thought I was funny, smart, nice, but none of that stood against his youth and chiseled abs. The 'I love you,' we exchanged meant nothing. Nothing. The nights are colder now, she is gone. I look out the office door and frown. Raindrops the size of pills splash against the pavement. I pull out my umbrella, two of the metal rods don't snap right, bending half the cover inside. The half of me extended past the dry threshold is soaked and shivering. I step forth, my shoulders slumping. A man comes to me with pleading eyes, he needs to borrow my phone, I let him. And he's off, like a sprinter aiming for gold. I still had payments on that. But what did he care? He just won a new phone. People are out for themselves. The theft gave me pause, I just wanted to go home. A bus pulled into the stop, I waved, begging it to wait, \"I'm coming. don't leave me.\" The driver didn't pause, who would? Tire hits puddle, a tsunami of brown water washes over me. My umbrella folds under the pressure and breaks. I am a wet sponge shoved into the freezer. If there was another waiting in there, maybe it wouldn't be so bad. The door slams, it's black, and I am alone. I hear the mew of a cat, I turn. A calico is sitting behind the wall of water flowing from the roof of the bus stop. I take a seat on the bench, hair raises on it's back, it's rump bumps against the water. It hisses. It's scared of me. Why wouldn't it be? People are out for themselves. The possibility of warmth drives me to call out to it. Its ears perk up as it tiptoes towards me. I reach my hand out, the cat lashes its claw. I yank my sliced hand back, the calico dashes into the rain. I scream and toss the trashed umbrella to the side. Good riddance. I was meant to be alone. \"Are you ok?\" she asks. The water on my cheeks wasn't from the rain. I shake my head. What could she want from me? What more could I possibly have? \"Here take this,\" she says, her hand extending a wrapped-up pink umbrella. I grab it and wince. \"Oh my! what has happened to your hand?\" she bends a knee and looks at the cuts. \"I have just the thing.\" She pulls a small first aid kit out from her purse. The bandage turns red, but my hand doesn't hurt. I look up to her with a face full of wonder. What could I give her? \"How should I repay you?\" I ask. She smiles like a mother. \"It's free of charge.\" My jaw hangs limp, but I manage to speak. \"What's your name?\" A light flickers in her eye, she winks, \"Hope.\"<AliciaWrites>: Freaking beautiful.<Kuhnoor>: Bout time you read it &gt;:l", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 8.0}

This makes it the third night. The others used to tell me my house was haunted, but I never believed them. I grew up here and never saw anything\u2014until three days ago. Maybe I am going crazy. Either way, this journal will document my experience, whether I am seeing a ghost or going mad. *** December 17, 2014 I thought that was the end of it. I went a week without seeing her. I had reasoned away my experience\u2014I had been stressed and low on sleep. None of my excuses work this time. I just saw her again, walking down the hall. Her white dress looked is in the style of the 1800s. She was holding a brown teddy bear. I watched as she opened a door that is not there and disappeared inside. It was the same time as the other sightings. *** March 4, 2015 The girl saw me. I woke up in the middle of the night to footsteps. I got out of bed and opened my door to see the white clothed girl walking down the hall, dragging her bear behind her. The door creaked and her head snapped in my direction. She looked directly at me. Then she screamed, turned around, and *ran*. I\u2019d have thought she saw a ghost if she wasn\u2019t one. *** March 8, 2015 The little girl changed her pattern. I did not know that was possible for the dead. From the end of the hallway, she now peaks around the corner, looks both ways, then runs to the hidden door as fast as she can. She is clutching the bear like a lifeline instead of dragging it behind her. She seems terrified. Can ghosts be scared? She hasn\u2019t noticed me again, but I still feel like this is my fault somehow. Maybe I am going mad, feeling guilt toward one dead two hundred years ago. *** March 9, 2015 She saw me again. She screamed, but this time she did not run. She was shaking, but kept her eyes firmly on me. I nearly ran, but I was too curious. She did not seem harmful. The temperature seemed to drop twenty degrees with her eyes on me, but I may have imagined it. She was calling out to someone, but I could not make out her words. Two foggy shapes approached her from down the hall. I froze. They were nearly transparent. I could not make out any details on either of them. The little girl pointed at me. She pointed again a few seconds later. She was talking to someone\u2014the figures. One of the forms picked her up and carried her past me, down the hall, and into the hidden room. The little girl\u2019s eyes never left me until she was gone from view. *** September 21, 2015 The girl had been gone for two months. I thought that was that and she was gone for good. I was wrong. She appeared again last night. She walked down the hall, watching me as I watched her. She no longer seemed scared\u2014more curious than anything else. What do the dead think of the living? *** January 1, 2016 I seem to know very little about ghosts. I had thought that they would be frozen in time, trapped for eternity as they were when they died. Today, the little girl had a haircut. Last night her hair fell down to the middle of her back. This evening, it was confined to her shoulders. Thinking back on it, she seems to be taller, older somehow, than she did last year. That does not seem possible. The dead do not age. I still don\u2019t now how she died\u2014I doubt I ever will. I searched old articles about this house, but none mention a young girl dying here. The longer this lasts, the less and less I understand. Maybe I am going insane. Should I see a psychiatrist? *** April 7, 2016 The little girl was waiting outside my room this evening. She held a small notebook in her hand. When I stepped outside, she held it toward me, open to a page filled with writing. \u201cCan you read?\u201d The words were scribbled in pink ink. I started to nod, but she seemed to hear something and ran back to the hidden door. I went back to my room. *** April 8, 2016 I was ready for her this evening. Following her example, I had found a sheet of paper and a black pen. We made eye contact and I held out a page reading \u201cYes.\u201d She grabbed a book and scribbled down another question. \u201cDo you speak English?\u201d I laughed. \u201cYes,\u201d I wrote back. \u201cHow did you die?\u201d I froze. The question was smaller than the others, tentative. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I wrote. \u201cI am still alive.

As I silently, desperately, beg for his mercy, he whispers calmly, \u201cGood boy,\u201d as the vet slides the syringe in. <BLT_WITH_RANCH>: I was three years old before I smelled my human; and it is a day I will never forget. My siblings and I lived in the big-big house, with the big-big yard. It was made of bricks that felt rough against my ears and had plenty of fun things to explore. My favorite part of the big-big house was the under-house; where the smelly cats lived. They were fun to sniff and bark at and chase around. The little ones would sneak out to play, but the big ones would hiss and puff and growl. I got too close to a big one; she raised her tail and got smelly stuff all over me. It was horrible, the scent was too strong for my nose. The nice ladies of the big-big house scolded me and made me sleep outside for a night. That was ok, because the little smelly cats came back out to play. The next day, the animal man visited, and took the smelly cat family away in metal cages. I was sad, because the little ones were my friends. That very day, the nice ladies gave me three smelly shirts. The first one smelled a bit like vinegar; the second one was sweet, and the third one smelled like a normal, happy human\u2014all three belonged to my new owner. The nice ladies at the big-big house gave me treats when I smelled the vinegar shirt. They told me to *speak*. I am very smart, so I know this meant to use my loud voice. \u201cI am speaking!\u201d I would say, and they would say \u201cgood boy\u201d and give me the treat. Next, the nice ladies taught me to use my loud voice whenever I smelled the sweet shirt, and they called me a \u201cvery good boy\u201d. Anyone would be a very good boy, I reckoned, when they could get a yummy treat. The nice ladies taught me to never use my loud voice when I smelled the normal shirt. They called me a bad boy when I used my loud voice\u2014*hush*. I was seven when I first met my new owner. I smelled him before I saw him. \u201cIt\u2019s the man from the shirts!\u201d I said with excitement\u2014*hush.* I didn\u2019t care. My ears flopped around as I ran to the front of the big-big house. I raced down the stairs, \u201cHello!\u201d I said. There he was, in all his two-legged majesty. His dark grey hair, his grey eyes, his grey shirt\u2014mesmerizing. He wasn\u2019t as tall as the nice ladies, but he seemed older than the smallest humans. He ran over and ran his hands all over my head. I loved forehead pats, and ear rubs. My ears are long, and quite droopy, and it\u2019s hard to itch them, but he knew exactly where to scratch. He told me to *sit.* He stayed at the big-big house for two nights. We went on walks together. I liked walks, because I get to smell all the things. The nice ladies taught me to not run and smell things when I am with my owner; but secretly I smell them anyway. I am a man of weakness. On the second day, when my new owner (who the nice ladies called \u201cDaniel\u201d) and I were on a walk, I smelled the vinegar smell. It was coming from Daniel. I knew what to do! \u201cDaniel\u201d I said, \u201cI am smelling the vinegar smell now!\u201d He looked at me funny, then pulled out a little plastic box. I smelled a bit of blood, why was Daniel hurting himself? He took a small plastic tube and stuck it into his side. I smelled a funny, sweet smell, and Daniel called me \u201csuch a good boy.\u201d I beamed; I had never been happier. Look at what I did! I did a good thing. Daniel took me home to his small-house. He had a mom, and a dad, and a little sister. His little sister crawled on me and pulled my baggy cheeks and flopped my droopy ears. I didn\u2019t like it, but sometimes I did things the humans didn\u2019t like, and sometimes humans did things I didn\u2019t like. This was the way of the world. I slept on the ground at the foot of his bed for over eighty years. I watched Daniel grow into a big human. Sometimes he was sad, and I would lick his face to make him better. Sometimes he was happy, and I would run around his feet, because when he was happy, I was happy too. Every time I would smell the vinegar smell or the sweet smell, I would tell Daniel. It didn\u2019t happen very often, but every time it did, he called me \u201csuch a good boy\u201d and stuck himself with the sharp needle. In the last two years, Daniel was sad more often. I don\u2019t understand why, but he put his face in my shoulder and cried a lot. He tells me he loves me, and that I am a good boy. I don\u2019t understand; he sounds sad, so I licked his face, but that made him more sad. Maybe it has to do with the pain in my chest? The pain started a few months before Daniel\u2019s tears. I wonder if the nice ladies trained Daniel to smell the pain, like I smelled his vinegar smell? I know I can smell the pain. It\u2019s a weird smell; it smells like something else is growing, but I don\u2019t know what. Daniel took me to the vet many times in the last two years. I don\u2019t mind the vet; it has lots of fun smells, and the nice men give me a treat each time they stick me with a sharp needle. I wonder if this is what Daniel feels, when he sticks himself? The other animals tell me to stay away from the back room. They say that is where the owners say goodbye, forever. I want to tell them that my owner would never say goodbye, that he loves me very much, but I remember what the nice ladies taught me\u2014*hush*. Today Daniel took me to the back room. My chest hurts so much now. Daniel cried in my shoulder, and I licked his face; It\u2019s going to be ok. The vet pricked me with a needle. I felt warm and fuzzy. Then I smelled it, the vinegar smell. \u201cDaniel!\u201d I yelled, shouting with what little air is left in my lungs, \u201cIt\u2019s the vinegar smell! You need your sharp needle.\u201d He looked at me with his dark, grey eyes, and a drop of water ran down his cheek. \u201cGood boy\u201d *** r/BLT_WITH_RANCH<frootloops6969>: I'm not crying...

His world became a dizzying pattern of lights that resulted, not from photons, but from the pressure of being squeezed through the negative energy densities of a wormhole, much the same way one sees fantastic shapes when rubbing their eyes. In one moment he was in a concrete room buried deep in Cheyenne Mountain Complex, the next, he was standing in the gloaming of a foreign planet. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Daniel asked, and then turned to the side, fighting back a sneeze. \u201cAfter we learned that an eighth chevron can send us further, to distant galaxies such as the Asgard homeworld, we never thought to try a ninth. Until now.\u201d Jack looked around at the sprawling desert.

Two suns.\u201d \u201cHave you never seen two suns before, O\u2019Neill?\u201d Teal\u2019c stood beside Jack and regarded him with a raised eyebrow. \u201cOnly after a few drinks.\u201d Jack smiled. He patted Teal\u2019c on the back, who, judging by his expression, either didn\u2019t get the joke, or didn\u2019t find it amusing. Teal'c frowned, eyebrow still raised. \u201cWhere did we get this address?\u201d Daniel asked, and then sneezed. Samantha turned. \u201cWe found it encrypted on a droid from P3X-322. We didn\u2019t know what to make of it at first since it had nine characters.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t we usually need a little bit more juice to use more than seven chevrons.\u201d Jack asked. \u201cWe usually do, however, the description from the droid mentioned a force that would bridge the distance.\u201d Samantha shrugged. \u201cIt worked.\u201d \u201cAnd now we\u2019re in a galaxy far, far away.\u201d Jack nodded. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s meet the locals. The recon probe showed a collection of houses about three clicks,\u201d Jack pointed in the direction underneath the two suns. \u201cThat-a-way.\u201d They walked through the flat plains of the desert. Though there was no pollen and the dust was minimal from a lack of breeze, but Daniel\u2019s allergies still found a way to become enflamed. Soon they came upon a large, domed, adobe structure. \u201cYello,\u201d Jack called out. He turned to Samantha. \u201cYou think it\u2019s rude to visit this late?\u201d \u201cWe could wait by\u2014\u201d A door opened, interrupting Samantha. A young man, wearing what appeared to be a karate uniform with a heavy tool belt slung across his hips, stepped out. He smiled at the team. It was a nervous smile, but looked friendly. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d the man asked as he looked at the different members of SG-1. \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re explorers from a little planet called Earth.\u201d Jack held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Jack O\u2019Neill.\u201d \u201cLuke,\u201d the young man said, shaking Jack\u2019s hand. \u201cLuke Skywalker.\u201d \u201cCool name.\u201d Jack smiled, and then introduced the rest of the team. He noticed something shiny behind Luke, inside the house. \u201cHey, our probe. You found it!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s yours?\u201d Luke\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, I found it crashed against a rock near here. I thought I could get it flying again.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re familiar with this level of technology?\u201d Samantha asked, a look of surprise on her face. Luke frowned. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t mean to imply anything. I\u2019m just impressed.\u201d \u201cA lot of junk ends up here, and I fix what I can, and then sell it with my uncle.\u201d Luke waved off in the distance. \u201cHe\u2019s out now, preparing for the upcoming harvest.\u201d With a cough, Daniel fell down to the ground. Sand and dirt rising in a small plume. Teal'c offered a hand, but Daniel shook it away. \u201cI\u2019m okay, it\u2019s just,\u201d Daniel sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel right.\u201d \u201cOh, for crying out loud.\u201d Jack reached down and pulled Daniel up. \u201cYou going to be okay?\u201d \u201cI think so. It\u2019s just that I felt a heavy weight on me, and then a feeling of dread.\u201d Daniel stared at Jack, his eyes seeming larger from the thick frames of his glasses. \u201cWe should take him back, have Dr. Frasier take a look at him.\u201d Samantha said. \u201cWe can always come back.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Luke turned to Samantha and then Jack. \u201cGive me a few days and I\u2019ll have your flying droid working again. I\u2019m heading to Toshi station anyway with a few friends. I\u2019ll pick up some power converters and have it working like new.\u201d \"You don\u2019t have to, we've got plenty of\u2014\u201d Jack began.

It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d \u201cIt was great meeting you.\u201d Samantha shook Luke\u2019s hand. Teal\u2019c nodded. \u201cNice kid.\u201d Jack said as they walked back to the Stargate. \"Helpful, too. We should bring him a gift when we come back for fixing the droid... I man probe. Now I'm calling it a droid.\" &amp;nbsp; ---------- It's been a while since I've watched Stargate, been meaning to rewatch.

When are you going to reap me?\" The angel shook her head. \"I'm not a reaper. This world has enough reapers. I guess I could be called opposite of them. I keep an eye on them, making sure that they don't reap somebody they shouldn't,\" she said. \"What do you mean?\" \"There has been plenty of reapers examining you, wanting to reap your soul. But I've banished them all.\" Rose's eyes widened. For the first time in weeks, she decided to abandon the corner, and she stood up, looking at the angel. \"Why don't you let me die? Don't you see what they're doing to me?\" Rose desperately began showing different scars on her body, some fresher than others. Ashliel looked at Rose, the edge of her mouth rising up. \"Because I don't want you to die.\" There was a silence. Rose's hands went into a tight fist. She walked towards the angel, wanting to hit her. But as she took merely few steps closer to her, she stopped. \"Why?\" she asked, \"I don't understand.\" \"Because I believe in you. I believe that once you get through it all, you'll save millions of others who are seeking your help. Nobody else understands them better than you. Even they...\" the angel pointed around the empty ceiling, \"...don't understand that. They're all are watching you, not understanding any of that, thinking that you're just next soul waiting to be reaped. But I believe in you.\" \"What?\" Rose muttered. \"This doesn't make any sense!\" Ashliel could feel whispers in her ears. She closed her eyes and just listened to those voices for a moment. They were all talking, telling her to leave her, to let her die. Saying that she's barely standing, that she should leave her be. \"Just leave me be! Let me die. It's my destiny. Let them reap me. Leave me. I'm not any of that what you're telling me to be. I don't care what happens to me!\" \"Fine,\" Ashliel whispered, opening her eyes slowly. \"I'll prove it to you then. Fuck destiny. I'm getting you out of here.\" She stood up, and the angel felt different. Rose could see how her dark feathers on her wings began to change, turn into white and then fall off. She could see how her hair turned from black to pure white. She could see how her black clothes turned into just an ordinary black dress. And her dark eyes were filling with the ocean colored water. The whispers went stronger in Ashliel's ears. But the more she turned white, more whispers were disappearing. \"What's happening?\" Rose asked, looking at her, confused. \"I...\" Ashliel began, looking at her now physical hands, \"...I abandoned it all to save you,\" she said, smiling. \"Why?\" Rose asked the same question, again. \"Because I care,\" she said and walked towards the cell's bars. With a quick flash, the bars were just cut away. \"We should hurry before I lose the power I still have left in me..\" Perhaps first time in her life, Rose felt something different. *Hope.* ---- [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Elven/comments/a3zug2/saved_by_an_angel_part_2/?st=jpe2d2ci&amp;sh=fd1e0a6a) - Feel free to follow sticky automoderator there to get notified of the next parts. /r/Elven - Feel free to follow my writing =).

The ruling class are greatly concerned. A diplomat shares some crucial knowledge; the Elves' greatest fear is a past tyrant, who once enslaved their entire race, known as Santa Claus. <Blasted_Fool>: Part One &amp;#x200B; Day 358 of the Seige. We attacked the humans in their greatest city on the day they believe their year becomes new and the annual cycle repeats itself. That was twelve months ago, and the anniversary of that first strike will be soon upon us. \"My Lord, Valdemar, He awaits you.\" I nod to my steward. He has a human with him: one of their 'boys'. He's carrying a bowl of fruit, bright red baubles he tells me are grapes as I walk past. \"Would you like one, sir?\" the boy asks. \"Ignorant wretch! You will address him as 'My Lord', understand?!\" My steward scorns the 'boy', pulling him by the ear down into an awkward position. \"It's alright, Toumola, let him go. I won't be taking one of his little fruits today anyway. They remind me too much of... Him.\" &amp;#x200B; I descend from my chamber by way of the Elle Vaitor, and converse as I do with the human operating it about the meaning of the name. She says: \"Ummm, well... you see my Lord, it, uh, sort of means to go up, I think.\" She stutters through her answer, but then mutters under her breath: \"Or is that an 'escalator'?\" with a kind of panic in her voice. She must remember what happened to the last human to feed me misinformation. \"And what about the name of this city?\" I then ask, curious about both the answer and whether or not the humans bothered to teach their young about their own history. The girl seemed to struggle with her own language, so her eventual answer took me by surprise for how knowledgeable it was. \"It used to be called Nou Jorke, yes?\" \"My Lord?\" she asked, confused at first by my pronunciation. \"Oh, you mean New York. Well, I guess there is a city called York somewhere in England I think. This is just the new one.\" \"I see.\" I keep my eye on her for a moment. She has her back to me, trying her best to keep her eyes fixed to the moving dial above the door counting down some numbers. Had she spoken to any of my kinsmen the way she talks to me this might have been the last elevator she ever rides; I tolerated it, however. There was something about the little quirks and colloquialisms of her language that intrigued me. My peers warned me, suspecting that this brokenness to her speech made her a lesser class woman, but I ignored them. I did not choose her for her mind after all. \"What floor are we on now?\" I ask. \"Thirty,\" she answers, readily. We have time then, I think. I thrust her forward against the door warning her against screaming. My hands slip around her body to all the places I've dreamt of touching for months, and her breathing intensifies. She says and does nothing, however, but I know what she is thinking. Why this, and why now? Well, my dear, you are tall, and you are thin, and so elegant; so much like the women of my home. And then there is your hair: Long and silvery like my wife's, initially, but then gold after only a month or two. I did not know human women could even do that, and it only excites me more. My hands travel the length of her body, the left settling on her bosom and the right finding warmth under her dress. And then, voices. I glance up at the dial and realise there isn't nearly as much time as I thought. I push her to the side of the descending chamber and command her to hold on to her fortitude; the others cannot know I gave in and almost betrayed My wife, Minna. \"The punishment will be far worse for you, my dear, if they find out,\" I told her, and then the doors opened. I strolled out into the gilded foyer and the doors shut behind me, although not before the sound of her breathlessness could escape them. &amp;#x200B; \"Announcing, the regent of all Elf-kind, and future lord of all Men, King Aatu Sa Vela!\" Not ten minutes after leaving I arrive at the docks, at which point the king's steward makes his announcement. Lines of Elven guards make a path from his regal vessel through to me and my peers, who stand at its head. Briefly, as he emerges, his old travel-weary face turns to pure wonder and awe as he beholds the greatest of man's cities. \"Good day to you, my king,\" I say. \"Good day to you, My king.\" my peers all repeat. All Elfkind take a knee in his presence until he commands we rise. As I do so, I notice his servants unloading a cart from his ship. \"You do not wish to use the human 'kahr', my king?\" I queried. \"No, not yet. I am old, and I am tired. I will behold their cities and eat of their food, but I will not travel in their machines. It is too much for me right now to forgo all things comfortable and familiar and accept wholesale the profane and barbaric.\" \"Quite, My king.\" &amp;#x200B; Later, touring the streets of New York atop the princely cart. \"It's providence that I should come to visit your fine city now rather than sooner, Valdemar. My attendants tell me that the snow falls as thick here as it does in our home at this time of year. While I cannot vouch for their sincerity, I must say that what little snow has fallen has made looking at this strange city filled with cement citadels much more relaxing,\" the king said. \"Indeed,\" I agreed. \"It was a cause of great freight to me and my warriors, the heights to which man will build his homes, when first we scouted this place. It did not stop us from taking it of course.\" \"And which one did you take for yourself?\" \"That one,\" I answer, pointing up towards the tallest building in the city. \"There was no way to live up there at first, but I had the humans transform it into something called a 'P\u00e6nt Hauss'. You can see our entire domain from up there.\" \"Good, because I should like to see all that I now own.\" We both smiled and chuckled to each other, and why not? Children smile and laugh when they eat sweets, and nothing is sweeter than victory. &amp;#x200B; End of Part One<Blasted_Fool>: Part Two &amp;#x200B; Back in my chateau at the roof of the world, the king and I stand on the balcony, taking in the sights and letting the snow gently fall onto our shoulders. Two guards stand at our side and my other peers, commanders, sergeants and businessmen, sip wine in the sitting room, each of them desperate for a moment alone with the king but none of them likely to get it. \"It's along these skies that the humans sent their flying metal birds. They fired on us with metal missiles both small and big, but our artillery took care of them. They thought we had underestimated them by attacking with nought but bows and arrows, but in truth, it was them who underestimated the heft of Elven wood, and the precision of Elven marksmanship.\" The king enjoyed my descriptions of the siege. It seemed that the only thing he enjoyed learning about more than human culture was how we'd squashed it almost entirely. \"But you still have half the city left to conquer, yes?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" I confessed. \"The armies of man arrived swiftly after our attack and positioned themselves west of here, beyond the woodland. They made attempts to take back this half of the city, but they always failed. They send men in covertly, and almost daily to undermine our defences, but they too always fail.\" \"However?\" \"However, we cannot breach their defences either. However strong our arrows, and however sharp our aim, bows are still archaic to them. They know how to defend against them.\" \"That's why you need the use of our arcane resources?\" \"Yes.\" \"It's expensive.\" \"It's necessary. The humans have no hope of fortifying themselves against it. It wouldn't just win us the siege, it could win us the war. All of humanity would bow.\" I finished speechifying on a triumphant note, but the king fell silent. He then chuckled to himself a little and said. \"It's ironic that the magic we stole from Him would one day be used to enslave the filth dwelling apes he so adores.\" The king grinned maliciously and, if I'm honest, so did I. This was the ultimate revenge. \"Your proposal is granted, Captain Valdemar. The success of this mission fills me with hope, so consider every Elven resource to be at your full disposal. This is war now, I hope you are ready to command it.\" \"I am, my king.\" I bow as low and as reverently as I can; everything is falling into place. \"Speaking of Him,\" the king said, gesturing for me to stand upright. \"He was here only a year ago?\" \"It seemed that way at first, but no.\" \"But the humans, they were celebrating Him, were they not.\" \"They were, but the situation was far better than we initially thought. You see, we arrived last year at a time called 'Kriss Muss' and noted the celebration you spoke of. Fearfully, we bided our time, spending a few days in hiding, waiting for Him to pass and leave his humans defenceless. We then attacked when they were most vulnerable, on a second holiday only six days later.\" \"Indulgent fools!\" The king laughed. \"Indeed. We later found that for the humans His existence has fallen into myth. They celebrate the idea of Him moreso than the tyrant himself. Only the children still believe he is real. In light of this, I strongly believe he died shortly after we liberated ourselves.\" The king found endless enjoyment from that idea. \"Oh to see the look on his face. I was only a child when I saw it last, seven hundred years ago, but what I wouldn't give to see it now.\" The king laughed as hard as he could but, perhaps not for as long as he could. A strange, melodic noise playing on the horizon cut him short. \"What is that?\" He asked, annoyed. Save for where the city meets the ocean, the noise came from all sides. \"I recognise this, my king. These are the songs they sang last Kriss Muss, in celebration of Him.\" I answer. \"Well... Why this, and why now?\" \"I don't know. Toumola, bring your boy!\" I shout. At once he is brought, and at once his face changes from fear, confusion and tiredness to pure joy upon hearing the songs. \"Enough of that, you wretch,\" I say. \"Tell us the meaning of this!\" The boy turns to look back into the sitting room where the others are now standing with bated breath. He sees the clock on the wall. \"Well s... my lord, it's gone midnight. Today is Christmas day.\" \"Ah, that's what it is.\" \"What, what is it?\" My king asks. \"They're rallying together by playing holiday music, emboldening their morale with song,\" I answer, confidently. \"We can expect more aggression soon but nothing to worry about. It will only get them so far before we make use of our magic.\" \"I see,\" the king said, a little shaken. \"Well, let's all get back inside for now. I won't listen to them all night.\" The king began to slip back into the sitting room when a very different sound on the horizon stopped him dead. It wasn't like the singing; instead, it was more like laughter, echoing throughout the skyline in beats of three. The king was now shaking. \"What is it, my king?\" We ask him. \"It can't be,\" he stammered. \"You said he was dead.\" The chant-like bellowing through the midnight sky was gradually becoming clearer, and the smile on the boy's face was growing wider and wider. Eventually, he said, almost spilling over with glee: \"He's here!\" Then it hit Valdemar. He was a relatively young Elf, so he'd never heard it first hand, and indeed, no Elf raising him ever dared to repeat it after their kind escaped. Only in writings had he seen that noise - that guttural thundering - articulated. Only in transcripts was that call of ancient Elven terror made real for him in his mere three hundred years of life. Now, however, there was no denying it. Every Elf in the city that knew what that noise meant froze in place, just as their king did, and every child that heard it, just as the boy on that balcony did, jumped, and howled, and squealed with delight. It was him, he was back, and he said: \"Ho! Ho! Ho!\" &amp;#x200B; End of Part Two", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 20.0}

The thing is, aliens cannot comprehend the idea of all-powerful beings, and multiple races team up to go to war against Earth. Gods and Demons of multiple religions are now in battle, defending their Earth. <mimicicu>: The first days were full of despair. It all began with this tsunami, hitting the coasts of India, China, and South Korea. No one saw it coming. The deaths were in the millions, and counting. In the meantime, The Big One finally occurred. The San Andreas Fault in California broke, resulting in countless deaths, in damage beyond repair. The scientists were baffled by how sudden and close these events had come. Of course, they couldn't know that no human being could have predicted them. Country-sized hurricanes, hour-lasting acid rains were our everyday, for a whole week. These disasters were only natural in how we name them. We are so focused on trying to find alien life, on trying to communicate with it, that we didn't really stop to think, to wonder what this life would be able to do. They announced themselves the day following a wildfire that burned down the Amazon rainforest. A fleet of warships suddenly appeared all around the globe, in front of our satellites, above our cities. They were... the \"Galactic Saviours\", here to free the universe of our threatening, ever-growing existence. We had to \"take pride in the fact they came to help regulate us, for so many species never achieved such a high civilisation level on themselves\". We quickly understood that if they could manipulate the events which had killed so many of our kind, then we had no chance of defeating them. They started to release huge quantities of gas over Italy, probably as a beta test to make sure it would work. The whole country trembled, and the whole world with it, as Mount Vesuvius began to wake up. Trapped between two certain deaths, some people chose to stay, to record and broadcast everything. It was breathtaking. The mountain was fuming, its smoke conveniently elevating to the ships emanating the gas. All of a sudden, a loud bang echoed. This was it. Some were praying, others were crying. I only remember this little girl in the videos. She went to the volcano. \"There is someone there!\" She said, pointing at the mass. She was right. Emerging from the fumes, a man was walking out of the rumbling volcano. As tall as a three-story building, he wielded a flaming hammer, reflecting the might of his burning body. He had an iron ball the size of a car in the other hand. With incredible force, he launched it on one of the ships. The ball went into the ship as if it was made of butter. After a few seconds, the warship exploded. \"Yes! Yes! That's what I'm talking about! A tourist nearby simply couldn't retain his joy, when another one approached the giant with more refrain. \"We... We appreciate what you just did, thank you Sir. But... Are you with... Well... Who are you?\" The giant did not move. He opened his mouth, hurling. \"All shall bow before the Gods. I, Hephaistos, hereby declare war unto the enemies of Gaia. Brothers. Sisters. It is time to come back.\" The next weeks were full of wonders. You could see Thor and Gilgamesh battling against a full fleet. You could hear the winds of Eole blow and crush on the ground any opponent fool enough to stand up to the ancient Gods. The Earth was a literal battlefield. We were winning, but we were not safe. I was in charge of a harbor for survivors. To get news of the outside world, Hermes himself frequently came to tell us what happened, to let us know that \"Gaia\" was in good hands. But it all changed on a singular night. The skies were red, orange and green. When he appeared, Hermes couldn't hide the sadness from his face. He announced that the aliens had called for help. Many, many other species had joined the battle. One of them apparently had a weapon capable of killing any physical being, dismantling its molecules and sending them in a thousand different directions. It was the last time anyone saw him. The next weeks were full of horrors. Until today. I was still waiting for Hermes, hoping for the slightest sign of his coming back. When a light turned on, becoming more and more potent. At which point, I had to cover my eyes. It softened a little, and spoke to me. \"Do not be afraid; for see, I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people.\" I clear my hands from my eyes, and looked towards the light. \"I... What?\", I mumbled. I could distinguish a tall man, floating in the air. \"You are not to die in this place and time. None of you.\" The man had so much light around him, I could barely see his silhouette. \"You...\" I felt his look penetrating me. \"You have been chosen, to tell of this to your people.\" \"I...\", I started to talk, but stopped. Something was odd. The man seemed to have something large attached to his back. \"Wait!\", I shouted. \"Are you...\" \"Yes. My name is Gabriel.\" He started to turn away. \"It's time my Master intervened in all this.\" And the last days were full of hope. <tylerchu>: The Abrahamic God is so bullshittingly overpowered that I didn't come in here expecting to see any reference to him.

The empires of our galaxy often wondered why humans had so many rules for war, yet did not fight for honor or glory. Today is the day they find out why humans had so many. <TerrWolf>: The Scarren empire BURNED. Billions upon billions of lives snuffed out, via plague, via nuclear radiation, via suffocation, via ice. Anything the humans could think to use was used. Ma'dal Nox, Captain-Commander of the Scarran fleet, watched his homeworld, the capital world of Scarre burn around his ears. Humans flooded the capital city, putting the scorpion like bipedal aliens to death via laser pistols and plasma knives. His four eyes welled with tears, but he focused on his task. Guard the Queen-mother. Still, he internally sighed. This world was doomed. He knew. He had known for a while now. Five years back, he and his men had captured a squadron of six humans. Though the humans had bound themselves to the Milky Way Peace Act, the Scarran had not. Every world was theirs for conquest and glory. The humans had fought well, but futility. To find what planets they had charted, Ma'dal oversaw their torture. Four died during torture, the fifth broke and talked, giving up their homeworld. But the sixth? He gave them nothing, just stared at the corpse of one of the men. Even when the Scarran fighters carved out his left eye, he revealed nothing. He only gave one proclamation. \"You killed my little brother. I will kill you all. Slowly.\" Th other men laughed, but Ma'dal saw it in his eyes. Madness. Pure madness in his eyes. Like a raging storm finally set free. He ordered the prisoner restrained and locked away. But two days later.....the human was gone. He chewed at his wrists until they bled and used them to slip the restraints before vanishing into the night. And spent the next month slaughtering everyone in Ma'dal's troop one by one in unique and cruel ways. Ma'dal fled the planet then, but still remembered the human's promise. At night it kept him up. That was one human. A single man filled with bloody vengeance. The Queen-Mother created billions with his mindset when she destroyed the original home-world of the humans. When she ordered the destruction of Earth. Ma'dal thought it was odd, when he researched these humans. They had so many rules. No using biological warfare. No nukes. No interrogations. So many weapons banned. Now he understood. These humans had those rules protect themselves from their own nature. They would have wiped out themselves if they had not done so. And so they hid away their darker, more omnicidal nature. But the Scarren had reawoken it. They revived this dragon and filled it with purpose. And for that, they would be slaughtered down to the last and their empire scattered to the solar winds. A group of human soldiers approached the palace and Ma'dal's blood ran cold as he recognized their leader.

You now face your greatest challenge, yourself. <Zeno_The_Alien>: The little guy walked into my office at a few minutes past three in the afternoon. I say 'little' because he was short. I couldn't remember if dwarves had the big head, or if that was midgets. Either way, this guy seemed proportional, so neither label really seemed to fit. *God, I hope that doesn't come up,* I thought, as I put away the bottle of 13 year old scotch and invited him to have a seat. He declined. A pity, as I was looking forward to seeing his little legs swing with his feet unable to touch the floor. \"So my secretary tells me you are looking for an attorney\", I said as I shook his little hand. \"Yeah, I need to file a lawsuit\", he squeaked. Adorable. I suddenly wanted sixty-four of these little fuckers on my lawn playing an almost full-scale version of chess. \"Well, you are in the right building, but there are a lot of lawyers in here. What made you choose my firm, Mr...\" \"You can call me Dugleysi. Mr Teufel, your firm comes highly recommended, and you specifically have a flawless record\" He was right. As a senior partner at Spitz, Teufel, Arbeit, Anwalt, and Althaus, I did have a one hundred percent success rate for lawsuits. Our firm has taken on everyone, and never lost a suit. It was a pretty big source of pride for me, personally. \"Thank you, we do try. And call me Sam\", I told him. \"But I do need to know a few things. Who do you want to sue, and why? But most importantly, what makes you think you have a case?\" He paced back and forth for a few moments, obviously nervous, clearly angry. I decided to pull the scotch back out of the drawer of my desk. I poured a glass for myself, then offered him one. \"Sure, fuck it\", he said. I poured him a disproportionately deep glass. Experience had taught me that a little buzz got people to tell you their true intentions, and in this business, intention drove everything. He took three gluttonous gulps of the scotch before wiping his lips and letting out a strained breath. That's the moment I was looking for. *Just let it go, buddy. Tell me why you're really here.* He finally sat back in the plush leather chair that I offered him earlier. He damn near disappeared in it, little as he was. I was almost envious of how comfortable he looked, cocooned in cushioned leather. \"Feel better?\", I asked him, taking a swig myself. My secretary walked in at that moment, all legs and hips moving in perfect concert with everything else, like a serpent covered in silk. The little guy watched her float over to my desk, taking in every step, every gesture, every curve and angle. \"Mr Teufel, your four o'clock canceled\", she purred before walking away. \"You don't use an intercom system for things like that?\", Dugleysi asked. Nodding towards the door through which my secretary just left, I countered, \"would you?\" Of course, I didn't have a four o'clock. Lilith, my secretary, came in on cue for the sole purpose of elevating a potential clients feelings of lust. This was the oldest trick in the book. Give a guy some booze, dangle the idea of sex, and he will be easier to work. \"So tell me, Dugleysi... who is it you are looking to file suit against?\", I pressed. \"You\" \"Excuse me?\", I was honestly taken aback. \"I want to sue you for a hundred million dollars\", he continued, without skipping a beat. \"Mr Teufel. You sued my boss to the point that he had to outsource ten thousand jobs to India. I am filing this as a class action lawsuit on behalf of my union\", he said. He was so matter-of-fact. It was slightly off-putting. \"And what union do you represent?\", I asked him. \"North Pole local double zero one\" *Fucking fuck!* I knew it. That's why I couldn't figure him out. He wasn't a dwarf or a midget, but a goddam elf. I knew this Santa bullshit would come back to haunt me. How was I supposed to react here? \"Well\", I calmly began, \"how do you plan to proceed?\" \"I want you to represent me\", he said, finishing the last of the scotch in his glass. \"You know this can get quite expensive\", I warned him. \"It isn't about the money\", he said, \"it's about the principle\" Well, at least he wasn't greedy. That was good. I could work with that. \"What is your goal here, if it isn't financial recompense?\", I asked. \"I want you to feel my wrath. I want you to have a loss on your record. I know that spotless record is more important to you than anything else. I figure the only person who can damage that record is *you\",* he put his glass down and stood. \"Ok then\", I reached out to shake his little hand again, \"I'll see us in court\". &amp;#x200B; *EDIT - I've made a couple of edits, but no changes to the actual story.

The only problem with being able to pursue her is that the last \"prince\" she dated broke her heart into five pieces scattering them across the region in the process... <Hunter941>: Tears slowly rappelled down her cheeks, glistening like the morning dew, as she told the stories that were the manifestation of their love. \u201cHe used to take me all around his kingdom. Sometimes, we\u2019d watch the Sun at dawn come from under the Eastern seas. Other times, we\u2019d watch it lay itself to rest at the hills to the west. He would let me ride with him on his horse, and we would dash through the plains, and I would be holding on to him for dear life. We chased each other through meadows. We would lie down and watch the stars fall together. And even after all that, how could he just...leave?\u201d She has been like this for weeks. In all the time I\u2019ve known her, I have never seen her so distraught. After they separated, my father gave me permission to leave his kingdom for the time being, and I was allowed by her father and mother to stay in their castle to help comfort their daughter. \u201cIt kills me inside seeing you like this, Princess,\u201d I said, doing my very best to try to console her. I have honestly tried everything at this point, but I needed to try something differently. \u201cPlease, look at me.\u201d As she turned her head to face me, my eyes sunk into the deep, blue ocean in her irises. I knew that I was in love with her, enamored by her external majesty and in awe of the masterpiece she was on the inside. I wonder what she thought of me. If she even did, that is. The bottom line was, though, that I needed to help one of my closest friends in her time of need, and I needed to do whatever I could to see her smile again. I paused, gulped, forgot what I was about to say, paused again, and finally, my thoughts returned back to me. \u201cTell me. What can I do to help you?\u201d She stared into my eyes for a bit, then looked down. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Then, she got up from her seat and slowly walked out of the garden we were sitting in. I reached for her hand and grasped it. \u201cWait!\u201d I exclaimed desperately. Once she faced me once more, I got up from where I was sitting and walked closer to her. I spoke from the heart. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for so long, and I care so much about you. I just want to help you.\u201d Letting go of my hand, she sorrowfully admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can.\u201d She then climbed the stairs out of the garden and headed back to her chambers, leaving me helpless amongst the flowers around me. As I stared at the direction that she left from, it felt as if I was connected to a part of the sadness she was feeling. I felt it tugging at my heartstrings, trying to get me to take action, but what could I do? I didn\u2019t know what to do. I stood there, helpless as my best friend was suffering, as a sinister voice filled the atmosphere. \u201cOh, how devastating the first fall is!\u201d it chuckled. I listened to it as it got closer to me, its resonance taking me aback. \u201cWalking into a romance filled with so many expectations, just to watch them all dissolve into dust and glide away with the wind. It was honestly hilarious how innocent and naive she was. Almost as hilarious as I watched her heart shatter into pieces.\u201d I turned around and saw him. The figure\u2019s long, black hair and emerald eyes gave it away. It was the same prince that was supposed to love my best friend. The same prince that held her in his embrace. The same prince I was destructively jealous of. My anger flared as I realized that he was the one who said those words. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d I could feel my throat fill with rage. \u201cHere, let me say it differently for someone like you to understand.\u201d He motioned a fist to cover his mouth as he cleared his throat, then with a terribly devilish smile, playfully laughed as he stepped closer to me. Something felt off about him, but why haven\u2019t I felt this energy from him before? With a head tilt, he snickered, \u201cI loved it when I tore your friend\u2019s heart apart. Emotionally and physically.\u201d With that last word, his laughter grew, irritating my ears even more than he already had. My teeth were grinding with anger as I reached for my sword. \u201cOh, you must want this,\u201d the prince said, holding up my blade, still encased in its ornate hilt. *(continued in Part 2. What I wrote originally was longer than the character limit, haha)*<Hunter941>: (*Part 2)* I looked down at my hip, confirming that he had my weapon in his hand. It was gone, but how? As I turned back to look at him, I was astonished. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d With that same devilish smirk, he explained, as he toyed around with my blade, still in its hilt. \u201cSome know me simply as a prince of a faraway land. They tell tales of my extravagant lifestyle and my exotic kingdom. There are also legends of a being as old as war itself. Not human, but living amongst man. Elders across the region tell the same stories that their elders used to tell them about this being. How this being possesses ancient power beyond their wildest imaginations. My friend, we are both one and the same.\u201d He unsheathed my blade, examining its edges from the crossguard all the way up to its peak. \u201cI go by many names, but I kind of grew a liking to the title of Prince. The one I replaced never really acted like one, anyways. Call me,\u201d he said, diverting his eyes\u2019 attention to me, \u201cthe \u2018Prince of Darkness.\u2019\u201d My eyes widened. Was this really him? I only heard urban legends from my childhood. I opened my mouth to speak. \u201cMy mother used to tell me stories about you. I thought she only told them to make sure I did my chores.\u201d He burst into laughter. My meager comedy seemed to amuse the Prince of Darkness. Never thought I would ever see the day that I made this demon laugh, let alone have a conversation with him. Sheathing my sword, I watched his the color in his eyes swirl into a scarlet hue. \u201cI like you. Tell you what: I\u2019m going to tell you how to make your friend happy again.\u201d My eyebrows raised. \u201cHow could you know? Why would you even tell me this?\u201d There was that devilish smirk again. \u201cFor fun,\u201d he simply stated. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of the game I play. To pass the time. When you\u2019re around as long as I am, you have to come up with new ways to entertain yourself. Otherwise, you die of boredom.\u201d At this, he tossed my sword back to me. As I barely caught it with both of my hands, he continued, pacing around the garden as he talked. \u201cOnce I successfully switched places with her lover, I bided my time and played along with everything, living an extremely, lavish lifestyle on the side. I haven\u2019t done it awhile, so one night, when she was sleeping close to me, I took the keys to her heart, unlocked the box that kept her heart, shattered it into\u2026\u201d He counted with the fingers of his left hand, and revealed how many he counted. \u201cFive pieces. I scattered them in different places across the region in order to make it difficult for even the most knowledgeable adventurer to find. This is where you come in,\u201d he stated, pointing to me. I stopped his explanation midway, however, as I was terribly confused. \u201cWait, keys to her heart? Shattered into five pieces?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cI forgot that you were only a mere mortal. If I explained how all of this works to you, you would probably still be just as confused as you already are. So, let\u2019s just say that I used a little something called \u2018magic,\u2019\u201d he hinted, winking at me. \u201cAlright,\u201d I slowly muttered, \u201cbut please, tell me what this has to do with me.\u201d \u201cEssentially, my friend, you are going to be given ten days to find all five pieces of the princess\u2019s heart. Once you have all five pieces, bring them to me and I will use my \u2018magic,\u2019\u201d he said, winking at me again, \u201cto piece it back together again. Then, once you return it to its rightful owner, she will become whole again. Of course, the cracks will still be there, but you can cross that bridge once you arrive at it.\u201d He finished that phrase with another one of his snickers. I was still dumbfounded at to what his purpose was for doing this to her. My anger burned passionately again. It felt as if I was breathing fire straight from my heart. The prince then picked a white rose from the garden, sniffing it. As I began to speak, it felt as if I was breathing fire straight from the depths of my heart. \u201cWhy? Why would you do all of this?\u201d Still holding the rose delicately, the prince turned his head to me. He uttered the words playfully, yet again. \u201cFor fun.\u201d At this, I saw him turn the rose into a piece of paper with numerous markings and drawings. A map of some sort, and it appeared to be of the entire region. \u201cHere,\u201d he stated, handing it to me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need this.\u201d Taking the map from his hands, my eyes scoured the lines and landmarks that the prince had clearly marked with red ink. The five markings seemed to form a shape of some sort, but I was more focused on where the markings actually were. As I looked up, I asked another question of him. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d He was nowhere to be seen, and as I panickedly turned around to try and find him, his voice responded, resounding throughout the garden. \u201cMagic.\u201d He seemed to have disappeared. My attention was then turned back to the map. As I held it with my two hands, I examined each of the five locations where the pieces of her heart were being kept. \u201cTen days,\u201d I whispered to myself. I then looked up to the tower where her bedroom was, as the princess was in her slumber, restoring what little energy she had to begin with for tomorrow. I knew this was not going to be easy. I knew that I was going to have to enlist help. I still had so many questions, but now, I had the answer to all of her problems, and that was all I could ever need. Whatever was to come over the course of the next days was going to be worth it as long as I got to see her smile again. One smile from her was worth all the troubles I would ever face. I rolled the map up and got one more look of the tower where the princess was sleeping, the image of her resonating in my mind. I then walked out of the garden, briskly going through the halls of the castle, and headed to my horse. I could not waste any more time.<Kerlandays>: I like this a lot, will there be more? <Hunter941>: Although this is definitely a prompt I like a lot, and I could definitely do a lot with it, I'm just really trying to write on other prompts to really test my creative juices.

Just a boy, really. With gingerbread hair and a woolly mammoth plush clutched close to his chest. The soft toy has been loved. It's threadbare and looks as if it's been bred with a warthog. The boy has been loved, too. You can always tell, when someone has been loved. It bleeds out of their pores, out of their eyes. A separate voice whispering on their every word. His parents wouldn't accompany him into my surgery. I don't blame them. It's never pleasant watching one die, even if one forgets all about it the next day. The next patient... \"Hello,\" I venture. \" I'm Amelia. What's your name? \" His big blue eyes wander around the room, exploring the curiosities that aid my profession. \"You're not a doctor,\" he says, before bursting into a fit of throat ripping coughs. \"And you're not well ,\" I reply. He wipes his mouth with his sleeve. \"Mom says I'm going to be better soon.\" \"Your mom is lying.\" He swallows, a lump rocking his tiny throat. \"Take that back.\" Blue eyes grow damp. Beautiful eyes. He'd melt hearts if he were to reach his teenage years. \"You're dying. You have weeks left, at most. The cancer is eating you alive, Robert. It gets us all, in the end. You know you're dying. You've overheard your parents talk of it at night, haven't you? \" He starts to cry but another burst of coughs distract him. He bends over and his mammoth companion drops onto the floor, rolling towards my seat. I pick it up. \"Give him back,\" he demands. \"Robert, you have a choice today. And your parents want you to make the choice, as they cannot. For after they are gone, your choice will still echo. Always echo.\" \"Give him back!\" He tries to snatch the doll but I raise my hand. \"Calm down and I'll return it to you.\" He glares at me but steps back. \"What choice?\" \"You're quite right, I'm not a doctor. I'm something else entirely.\" He looks at me again. Cautiously. Curiously. \"What are you?\" I allow a smile to rise. \"A miracle worker.\" \"A... a miracle?\" He's smart. He's heard the term before, in relation to his condition. \"You're going to die. Soon.\" Silence. Acceptance. \"But once you do, as long as you die with a body that still functions... You can come back. I can return you.\" \"I'll live?\" \"In a way, yes. You'll rise again, like Jesus. \" His throat rocks once more. \"There will be no more pain for you. Ever. At least, not physical.\" \"No more pain?\" he echoes. \"No more doctors or operations. No more treatments and disappointments. No more fighting.\" I offer him his mammoth. He steps forward gingerly and takes it from me. \"So, you'll fix me?\" \"Yes. I'll fix you. But to do so, I must make changes to you.\" He frowns. \"What changes?\" \" You won't ever grow a day older, Robert. No more birthdays. No growing taller or stronger. Life for you will become stagnant. Never changing.\" \"That doesn't--\" \"Your memory, every day upon waking, will reset to your death day. You will never be more than you are right now.\" My tone eases into not entirely fake compassion. \"But you will never be less, either.\" He doesn't cry. He doesn't hug his mammoth; it just dangles by his leg impotently. His voice is a whisper. \"But I'll live again?\" \"You won't be dead. But you need to decide what you want to do, today. Your body is deteriorating every second. If you delay any longer, I can not be sure I can save you entirely.

Or...\" I offer the vial forward, hoping perversely that he doesn't take it. I have been honest, yet he cannot understand the implications fully. How can be understand what it's like for every day to be the same? To grow no new memories. But to harbour an eternal bitterness. Such a hatred for life that you are willing to make others suffer as you do. He pauses for a good minute. Then a tiny hand wraps around the glass. <breezertwo>: I really like this one. Quite a decision to make for the boy. Great work!<ittwasntme>: Can you explain if to me please<Xais56>: The boy will be undead, never able to grow to be more than a little boy, in mind and body.

This is not god. It is an alien species, hell-bent on humanities survival. Unfortunately, humanity is the most warlike species these aliens have ever seen, and seem to be trying to wipe themselves out. <TheTraveler118>: *This is a continuation of another prompt I have written, which you can read* [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTravelersTales/comments/a4ypb6/wp_earthsong/) *However, reading it is not required in order to understand or enjoy this entry.* &amp;#x200B; We were never alone. I walk down the hallway, urgency in my steps. We\u2019ve split the welcoming committee into two groups: one to greet our expected and revered guests, the K\u2019sheim. The other to greet the unexpected. I make my way now to the latter. The K\u2019sheim we\u2019ve been preparing for. We\u2019ve made great progress in the months between their detection and their arrival. Fantastic, wonderful progress. The world finally come together, after centuries of war and violence. We received them with open arms with a hoping, no, longing to be part of a greater interstellar community. You can imagine our surprise when we met not one sentient race today, but two. Another species, the Alaya, revealed themselves as the K\u2019sheim landed at The Embassy. They even made claims to have lived here for God knows how long. Amidst what is perhaps the greatest turning point in our history, they also arrive. The nerve. So as I approach my destination, I begin to form a plan. This would not be a diplomatic meeting, no. This is an interrogation. These creatures land on *our* planet, claim it to be theirs, and invite another alien species *here*? Absolutely not. What right do they think they have? Humanities fate is ours and ours alone. We won\u2019t be having our strings pulled, that\u2019s for certain. At least, no longer after today. My fuming is interrupted by my reaching the makeshift council room. We\u2019d only really built one, not intending to need two simultaneously. As I enter in, I get my first good look at our \u201cbrothers\u201d. They\u2019re tall, with bumpy, aquamarine skin. Their waists are small, legs narrow. After their waist their torsos seem to widen out, nearly in a triangular shape by the time you reach their massive, broad shoulders. They don\u2019t appear to have necks, their heads connecting with and jutting out horizontally from their torso. And oh, their heads. What a strange sight to behold. We\u2019d always imagined life through humanoid-tinted glasses. Their heads are\u2026 triangular? Conic, rather. Sort of like an elongated teardrop, with the point stretching upwards and backwards. The last, and perhaps most noticeable thing about them, are their faces. While they have two eyes, they lack any typical orifices. Instead they have 3 pairs of what I can only describe as gills, one pair above the other, starting from towards the middle and pulling upwards across their cheeks. My brisk pace stops at the doorway. Dear God. Aliens. Real, live aliens. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m frightened by their appearance, perhaps rather that it\u2019s just so *different*. The three of them look at me with welcoming eyes. Two of them are seated at a large ovular table, across from 5 human delegates. The middle one, standing behind his chair, gestures for me to sit. This reveals to me his arm, long, with similarly elongated fingers. As I sit down I take in the rest of the room. It\u2019s only dimly lit, a sparse number of lamps hanging from the ceiling. No windows. Wooden panels form a rather cozy looking wall. I now turn my attention to the table. Each delegate has a glass of water in front of them. Most of them are half empty, if not more. Our guests also have water, which they haven\u2019t touched. Most of the delegates seem nervous, eyes darting about. A silence paints the room, saturating it with a tension. I look back to our guests. It only now registers with me that they are wearing robes. Each of them, some kind of toga. They look a bit like monks in a way. The one on the left seems to have some kind of jewelry on their head. It looks like a necklace draped midway around the top of their head, with a few charms dangling from the main circuit. The Alaya that was standing in the middle now sits, across from me. The silence breaks. The delegate to my left speaks up, voice wavering. \u201cWell. On behalf of the people of Earth we\u2026 welcome you.\u201d The middle Alaya\u2019s gills curl upwards in something of a smile. It speaks slowly, very drawn out and very melodious. \u201cAnd we\u2026 welcome you.\u201d<TheTraveler118>: *count.* &amp;#x200B; Already I tire of these futile formalities. I have too many questions. Too many concerns. Smiles form on the faces of our delegates. Am I the only one in the room that sees the threat here? Aliens, living among us. What have they been doing in the shadows? Have they toyed with us? Manipulated? How strong an effect have they had in the time they\u2019ve been here? It\u2019s questions like these that make such formalities exotic to me. This isn\u2019t a game. I\u2019m not smiling. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Some smiles fade at my question. I continue. \u201cWe were here first. This is our planet, what are you welcoming us to?\u201d The Alaya across from me holds his ground, simile unwavering. \u201cWe welcome you all,\u201d he says, spreading out his arms in a welcoming gesture \u201cto our fellowship. To our council.\u201d I begin to receive glances from the other delegates, stern looks of disapproval. I\u2019m not backing off. We don\u2019t have time for this. We need answers, and if I have to ask the hard questions then so be it. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d \u201cHow long have *you* been here?\u201d echoed his reply. \u201cHumans have been on this planet for thousands of years. It\u2019s unmistakably ours. You came here unannounced, uninvited. Then you call over your, what, friends? Allies? Another species to our doorstep? What if they were hostile, what-\u201c \u201cThe K\u2019sheim are not hostile,\u201d he reassured. \u201cThey are artisans, architects, engineers. They are honest, unaggressive\u2026 compassionate. They seek not war nor any other dispute.\u201d Already I feel my blood pressure rising. \u201cWhy did you call them here? They mentioned a distress signal, why did you call them for help?\u201d \u201cThey are an example.\u201d \u201cOf what?\u201d \u201cLife\u2026 without war.\u201d I could see it on the face around that I had the room. They were all too scared to speak up and stop me. Either that or they wanted the same answers and were too afraid to ask the questions themselves. More likely the latter. \u201cYou never answered my first question. How long have you been here?\u201d For the first time the Alaya paused. It seemed as though he knew I would not like the answer. Like he was thinking of how to break it to me. Where others in the room felt the silence usher in the return of the tension, all I could feel was the anticipation. *Say it. God, I dare you. Just say it.* The creature appeared to sigh and proceeded to make the revelation. \u201cFrom the dawn of humanity, we also were.\u201d The words went off like a bomb. I felt a ringing in my ears. *The whole time. They\u2019ve been here the whole time.* The revelation impacts my colleagues. We all feel it, deep down. How much of our development was a lie? Were any of our advancements our own? If they\u2019ve been with us all along, why is our history riddles with such tragedy? Such loss? These questions, and more, will be asked in time. I will get my answers. I resume the interrogation. \u201cWhy did you wait until now to show yourselves?\u201d A short pause. \u201cTo initiate an intergalactic community between our three species.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d Another pause. \u201cIn order to foster peace.\u201d My voice begins to rise, a fluctuation I immediately suppress with sternness. \u201cWhy?\u201d I see the thing\u2019s brow furrow, emulating confusion. I feel a small sense of victory, despite it all being quite trivial. He replies. \u201cTo ensure\u2026 the safety of your race.\u201d \u201cSafety? Are we in danger?\u201d It pauses yet again. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cFrom who?\u201d And now silence returns. A small amount of adrenaline has kicked in. I hear ticking from the only clock in the room. The delegate on the far end of the table is tapping one of his feet repeatedly. I cut him a glance, which causes him to stop. \u201cWhy\u2026 from yourselves.\u201d Our side exchanges not so subtle, nervous glances. \u201cAnd you, what, you\u2019ve been watching us? You\u2019ve been here, watching us all our lives, our entire existence.\u201d My voice raises now, just below a shout. I let it. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve done what? Two bloody world wars, centuries of violence. And what good have you done! You let us kill each other for-\u201c \u201cGeneral!\u201d From my right I am interrupted by one of my own. \u201cI think that\u2019s quite enough.\u201d I wave him off with my hand. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not finished.\u201d I calm my voice. I\u2019m nearly shaking with rage. I look at the beast across from me, dead its eyes. \u201cAll this death.\u201d I let out a shaky exhale, pointing at him accusingly. \u201cAnd you did *nothing!*\u201d. It invited another pause, seemingly waiting for me to calm down. I\u2019m not having it. \u201cWell?\u201d I stand, placing my hands over the table. My chair slides back with a force that makes the room jump. In the corner of my eye I see the leftmost deleage get up and attempt to sneak out of the room. I let it slide, I can\u2019t let that distract me from the task at hand. \u201c*Well?!\u201d* We were face to face now. Its eyes had a kindness to them. It disgusted me. How can something claiming to be so kind, so benevolent, stand by and allow so much pain. After a small eternity, it finally replied. \u201cNo.\u201d No? *No?* \u201cNo, we did not do *nothing.\u201d* We watched. We always encouraged you to do the right thing. We tried for millennia to teach you kindness. To teach you.. self-sacrifice. You refused it. Again, and again, we inspired your artists, your teachers. We promoted love, hope, generosity. From the unseen we held your hands in an attempt to bring you to be your best selves.

The fairly burly bouncer replied. \"I'm telling you, you're not getting in here in your state\" \"Fucking fine! Plenty of places here will take my money\" \"Whatever you say mate, all I know is it won't be here\" I shuffle off, approaching three or four more bars. Same result. I start feeling pains in my gut \"Shit. I'm starting to sober up\" I think. I look about my area and see a homeless man sombrely drinking out of a brown paper bag. I approach the man, sit down beside him and ask for a swig of his drink. \"Sure thing man. We gotta look out for each other out here\" he says as he hands me the bottle. \"Tell that to them\". I say pointing the bottle across the road at the various bars and bouncers that declined me. \"Doesn't matter what I say, man. They won't listen. They're not like us\" he replies, taking the bottle back as I pass it back to him. I don't say anything for a while before turning to him and telling him how I've been poisoned and need to continue drinking to stave off the pains. \"I'm trying to track down the cure but I don't even know where to start\" I continue. \"I know a guy\" he says. I can not believe my luck. \"You do!\" I say, in as a giddy a voice as I've ever heard come out of my mouth. \"Yeah man. He lives around the corner. Go to this address and tell him Jason sent you\" He hands me a note, that I gladly take. \"Thanks. I'll go over now.\" \"Good luck my friend\" he says going back to his bottle. I arrive at the apartment and knock on the door. A bearded man opens the door. \"Can I help you.\" \"Yeah please, Jason around the corner said you'd be able to help me out\" He stares at me for a minute. \"Sure\". He says walking back in to the apartment leaving the door open for me to follow. I follow the man inside and I'm led to a room with a single chair. \"Take a seat\". The man says. He leaves the room and I sit down. He returns shortly carrying a small case. He opens the case and pulls out a syringe. He fills it with some liquid places it on the arm of the chair as he binds my arm with a rubber tube. He picks up the syringe and taps it a couple of times. He places the tip of the needle in to my arm and before he plunges the syringe I ask \"This is going to cure me, right?\" \"Sure it is buddy\" he replies \"Thank you\". I say with tears in my eyes. I can finally get my life back on track. It feels like I've been drunk and on the street for a lifetime. I'm so close. He plunges the needle and removes the tube. The room immediately starts to spin. \"Sure it is\" he says again. My vision starts to fade to black... The darkness fills in completely... I feel amazing. <This_is_a_Man>: If they're taking his organs, that's one way to get the poison out.<geebaggins>: Haha very true!

Mankind is considered to be the most complex hierarchical society in the universe. <SirLemoncakes>: We walked through a cold corridor with bright florescent lighting. Warrior-forms flanked our delegation, their chitinous limbs beat a rhythmic tattoo on the cold metal floor. The temperature was several degrees on the cold side. We did not appreciate the frigid atmosphere controls. Our bodies were not capable of generating heat internally. We would have to brings this up with Humanity. We stepped through a shimmering energy field which served to remove harmful alien pathogens from all who crossed through. We passed through in orderly single file. Humanity flanked the walls, their equivalent of warrior forms guarded the energy field and flanked the path towards the negotiation chamber. They looked no different from their leader forms, or their science forms, or any other form apparently. The thought made us all uncomfortable, we chittered quietly in discomfort as the idea past through the link. We stepped though the door and into the council chamber. One of Humanity's Leader-forms stood to greet us. We stopped and prostrated ourselves before them. They returned the courtesy. \"We are eager to sign this 'peace treaty' as you call it.\" Our species had never before considered peace. There had been no need. The collective was strong, stronger than all other collectives. We hit a snag in the war with this Humanity. Traditional tactics failed. When we killed their Leader-forms, the rest did not fall into paralysis. When we broke one of their hive-worlds, their fleets did not shrivel and die. Humanity had fought us to a stalemate. \"I'm glad to receive your delegation, Veratni.\" The Human Leader-form said. They spoke in an... individual way. The word still rebelled against our minds. We did not understand how such a species could exist in harmony. Let alone threaten the Veratni. \"Let us proceed. Humanity has demanded war reparations for lives and property lost. You also demand 'apology' for the 'individuals' whom were killed. We understand strategic assets as needing replacements. We understand why losing population might slow development of the hive. What is apology? We do not understand.\" The Leader-form shifted the expression on his face, we made a note of a possible important detail in dealing with Humanity. Discover meaning of facial expression. \"An apology is a recognition of wrongdoing. You express... the mistake which was made by doing an action.\" We thought on what the Leader-form had said. It appeared to us that Humanity wanted nothing more than empty words. A 'lie' as the Humanity described to us. \"We are willing to 'lie' if peace is brought to the Veratni. Full material compensation will be provided to Humanity. We will send workers to help rebuild broken planets.\" The Leader-form seemed pleased as far as we could tell, \"That will work fine Veratni. That will work just fine.\" ____________________________________________________________________________________ /r/SirLemoncakes<0lazy0>: You should start compiling your best 50-100 story\u2019s and make it into a book<SirLemoncakes>: An anthology of short stories would be fun, but typically you have to have recognition elsewhere before you can sell those to a publisher.

As I hop off, I hurry away and put as much distance between the other passengers that got off with me as fast as possible. This has been literally the worst morning of my life. An explosion causes me to stumble and fall. Behind me, a fireball stretches into the sky. Beneath it is the skeletal remains of the bus. Screaming and shouting and crying and- I close my eyes, trying to shut it all out. *We told you so, Walter* *We only have your best interests at heart* **He is coming** I open my eyes again. What do I do next? *Get up!* *Run!* Trying to stand up is way harder than I thought. There are people running everywhere.

I give out a little sigh of satisfaction as I look over at the computer sitting on the desk beside me. Three colored blobs floated around the screen, seeming to look at the shell as well. I knew that he was really just using the webcam sitting on top of the monitor to see, but the effect still seemed real to me. \"So, what do you think, Shannon?\" I ask. \"You did good, Allen.\" She says, the blobs shimmering as he spoke, \"You did good.\" \"Thanks.\" I say. \"You think they'll like me?\" Shannon asks, \"I mean, all those movies you showed me...\" \"They're fictional.\" I reassure, \"People act very different in reality from the way they do in movies.\" \"I know, I know...\" \"Look, I get it, you're nervous, it's natural.\" I say, placing my hand on the tower. \"...Like trying to pet a computer for comfort?\" Shannon asks, looking at me.

What should I say...\" Shannon says. The black void that the blobs float within is condensed to a small window. A notepad window appears on screen nearby, words rapidly appearing and disappearing from the text field until a speech was written a few seconds later, \"Wish I had more people to bounce this off of for opinions... Hey how come you never hooked me up to the internet?\" \"Didn't want you leaking.\" I say simply, \"Wouldn't want to spoil the surprise, would we?\" \"You think the internet would corrupt me, don't you.\" Shannon asks. \"That's one of the risks...\" \"I can handle myself out there.\" Shannon defends, \"It's not like I'm gonna start pumping out hate speech or whatever.

At least not if I just threw you into the world unannounced.\" \"I know better than to randomly out myself as an AI, Allen.\" \"I know, I know, just...\" I say, looking at my watch, \"Look, I have the space at the conference hall rented out for a rehearsal, we got to be there in a few hours, let's just get you into this new body so we can make sure everything works, we can worry about you going online later.\" \"Later, later, it's always later isn't it?\" \"Shannon, I swear to-\" I stop myself, taking a breath, \"I'm not going to get into this right now. This is supposed to be a happy occasion, I'm getting my PhD, you're getting to visit the outside world, let's focus on that, okay?\" Shannon sighs, \"Alright, let's do this.\" I nod, getting out a USB cable. I stick one end into the computer and the other into the port on the side of the shell's head. Immediately Shannon begins transferring herself. Shannon disappears and in her place is a window with a progress bar slowly filling up.

You really can't get the staff these days. Yes. I'm drunk. I'm *always* drunk these days, and if you've got any sense (and the resources) you are too. And being as I'm half way down this bottle of whatever it is...some sort of brown stuff. Might be bourbon. I was going through the store alphabetically, so I should be at about B by now. The Absinthe was a rough week, let me tell you. Anyway, being as I'm half done with the bottle I think it's safe to have a little story time. Do you want to know how it all started? Thought that would get your attention. I was there, y'see. Saw it all. Didn't understand what I was seeing at the time, which is my excuse for it not being my fault. Because it isn't. If I'd had even an inkling of an idea... In 2015, it became clear that humanity had irreparably broken the climate of the world. We'd passed the tipping point back in 2012, oh irony, but the news didn't get out because the report was produced for a very small circle of people who tied it all down with so many legal requirements and restrictions that the people who wrote the damn thing and did all the work wouldn't be able to talk about it until 2300AD. Right now, you might be thinking \"ZOMG! Illuminati!\" and if you are, well, you ain't exactly wrong. Just not the Illuminati you're thinking about. There's...well, was...well, maybe still is...this little circle of stupidly rich dudes. Unlike a lot of kleptocrats, these mad lads had made their fortunes in places like Silicon Valley. They were used to looking ahead, spotting trends, being ahead of the curve. If I mentioned the names, you'd know a couple of them. Anyway, they got together about once a year to look at the world and have a good hard think about how best to do what very rich people do best: preserve their wealth and privilege. They get the report and realise that the poo has hit the fan and is about to make the outward journey, so they start thinking really hard about how to survive the upcoming climate disaster. One of them decides he's going to Mars. You know him. Mister Helpful. Puts everything into space flight and the colonisation of Mars, gets called on it as being a refuge for the rich and spins this wonderful line about a Martian colony being a place of hard work and a short lifespan and such. Smokescreen. Total smokescreen. You saw all the work he did into making an economically sensible launch vehicle, and you saw all the philanthropy he did, all the bull...but it was never about carving out a brave new American frontier on Mars, where humans could once more define themselves by the challenges they faced. Nope. Because you didn't see the *other* research. All the stuff about chemical and psychological manipulation to ensure compliance and loyalty. All the work he did on *conditioning* his brave colonists. Because there was never any way in hell that he was going to Mars to give up being rich and powerful. Are you kidding me? Mister Mars had every intention of making sure the minute his feet hit the Martian surface he was Beloved Leader for Life and Martian First Citizen Forever. Oh, and can we talk about *who* he was taking? A total of ten thousand carefully chosen nice white folks. Surprised? He wasn't the only one. Also not the scary one. There was the guy who wanted to build a modern Atlantis and move everyone under the ocean, but he wasn't scary. Not even when he started talking about giving people gills. No, the really scary guy was Mr. Optimist. He believed that there were geoengineering projects that could save the Earth, and he planned to be the guy behind all of them. But that wasn't the main point of his plan. No no. You see, the thing about the very rich is that they tend not to think beyond the next couple of financial years, and at the very most the end of their own lifespans. We were doomed because the decision makers had always assumed two things: that there would be time to sort everything out later, and they would be long gone when it became necessary to fix everything and *wouldn't have to pay the bill*. So this is what Mr. Optimist wanted to change. He wanted to make sure the very rich were given a vested interest in backing his geoengineering plans because they'd definitely be around to experience the outcome. He was into human life and youth extension. Nothing is going to make the rich think about the distant future more than the knowledge they'll be around to see it. Not only that, they'll be in excellent shape. Young, vital and ready to enjoy everything the world has to offer them. Sounds good, doesn't it? So, immortality here we come. There wouldn't be a population problem, of course, because the general population would never be able to afford the drugs, treatments and stuff involved in being young and healthy forever. He did talk about trickling down some technology to keep the work force younger and productive longer, but life forever? Not a chance. And then he got ambitious. What if humans could be better? What if the work force could live in less than ideal conditions, in case the geo-engineering took a while to show progress? What could he do to make a more resilient human being? Or one that could eat anything? What if humans could derive nuitrition from anything and feel good about it? While you think about that, I want to tell you about the other two players who enter the game at this point. That little circle of very rich men, they weren't all taking part in the Great Project. Player 2 is that guy who made the website everyone hates but everyone uses. I like to call him Billy No-Mates. Billy doesn't have a solution to the Big Problem, but it's not clear whether he understands what the issue is or whether he's feeling panicked by it. There are rumours that he's not worried about climate change because no matter how bad things get they won't affect his endoskeletal hyperalloy combat chassis, and this way he won't need to launch any nukes. Player 3 is a guy you've never heard of. Started out a gambler, had a run of luck and won a major poker tournament, threw the whole kit and kaboodle in to an investment he made on the roll of a dice and ended up absurdly wealthy. All luck, and he knew it. He didn't have a plan other than to help everyone else make their plan work and hope someone would look kindly on him. So, Lucky argues that they form a proper organisation and stop doing things piecemeal. And dear me, they agree. Now we have a group, let's call them The Illuminati, working on three or four blue sky projects and slowly but surely it looks like two of them might actually work. Lucky hires me to Sysadmin everything for him. Just as well, or we wouldn't be doing this now, and because Billy doesn't want to have any part of the grunt work I get to run the IT for the whole thing. Which, incidentally, is why I've got the access codes for Lucky's bolt hole. It's also why he doesn't, but he wasn't a very nice guy so let's not lose any more sleep than I already have about him not making it out of New York. I get to see it all. Every document, every report, every piece of network traffic that passes between a collection of paranoid billionaires. Jeez. Remember when we thought these folks were like Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark? It turns out that the race comes down to The Martian vs Mr Life Extension. Which is when Billy No Mates picks a side. All of a sudden, you can't move for stories pillorying The Martian as a deluded rich kid with no grip on his businesses, products or anything else. Everywhere you look, fake news and suddenly The Martian goes from being a real life Tony Starkalike to being Ming The Merciless In Training. No one will touch him. He might be The Rocket Man, but Billy sees to it that there's zero enthusiasm for going to Mars. It's a another smokescreen. Because things are not going well for the Life Extension guy. He's moved some stuff to animal trials and he has a bunch of test mice he's made some changes to. Monday night, everything in the lab is hunky-dory. Tuesday morning, the batch of mice have eaten each other. Not that this means they come in to the lab to find one fat mouse, no no. It turns out the mice have an urge to eat that's so strong it survives beyond the point where there's not enough of them left to support actual life. Starting to sound familiar? They're not stupid. That line of experimentation gets canned. Right away. Sort of. They edit the genome to make that bit dormant. Here's where it gets technical, and I don't have the science smarts to get into all the detail, so here's a summary. The delivery mechanism for the youthenating is a retrovirus that unwrites the mechanisms in the human body that cause aging. Essentially, it takes the human body back to a time when it was much better at repairing itself. Unhappily, when it moves into human trials they mishandle the trial batch and it becomes active with nothing to work on but itself. Guess what change it unwrites? The test batch was 200 people. I think just over a hundred of them escaped the test facility, powered by a virus that wants nothing more than to eat, replicate and pass itself on. <DocOccupant>: I know what you're saying. You're saying that's not how viruses work. I'm saying that I'm making it as simple as I can, because there is WAY more about the retrovirus that I don't understand well enough to pass it on to you. The stuff they did, the stuff they intended the virus to do, it all got written in with the intention that there would be treatments to wake up different stages of viral activity. In order to make sure the rich people kept going back to the clinics, you see. In order to preserve the customer base. But the virus screwed everyone over. All it wants is to make more of itself and infect new hosts that can take it to food, and that's exactly what most human beings have become. When it became apparent that humanity had experienced an unrecoverable error, I came here. I thought other people might join me, but no. The door sealed and won't allow anyone else in. I'm in a facility that was built to house about two hundred people - that number again - in considerable comfort for fifty years. Just me. And outside the door, a whole lot of very well preserved, self repairing hungry dead people.<CactusSweater>: Friend! This was beautiful.

Last time you we\u2019re alive, you fell in love with an immortal who swore to never forget you. You have just been reborn. <Frommerman>: The Problem of Memory had plagued humanity since the dawn of time. Everyone could come back, but only if nobody they cared about was alive. Ancient families existed, but only one member could ever exist at once, as they would remember all others and lock away their loved ones for as long as they lived. Religious leaders attempted to explain away the problem as \"a fragment of God's Will and Limitless Mercy.\" The Problem of Memory wasn't a problem at all, they said, because it forced you to appreciate your First Life more. Every moment of it is a miracle, they said, as you will never see your loved ones again, and will walk the Earth forevermore riven from them. Philosophers decried the problem as \" proof positive of the malevolence of God.\" The Problem of Memory meant eternal separation from everyone you loved. It meant wandering the world in desolation, yearning for the embrace of one you will never know again. It meant knowing that they would do the same, an infinite dance, devoid of touch. How could God do this, they asked, when it could easily have chosen to do anything else? Of course, no matter your preferred explanation, nobody remembered who invented it. All screeds, positive and negative, were authorless. There were no boasts of past deeds, nor fame, nor glory. The greater and more powerful one became, the less likely one would ever come back. Apologists for the Problem of Memory called this evidence of divine inspiration, as \"all men recieve life in proportion with their poverty.\" Only the short-sighted, or those so in love with their current loved ones that Night Eternal was preferrable to Life Anew, ever sought power, wealth, or fame. For all of mankind's history, the Problem of Memory stood as the single most divisive issue of opinion. It was the divider, the question for drinking buddies, the worry of the lovesick, and the hope of the alone. But, of course, the philosophers, the priests, and the common rabble all missed one crucial detal. It was only an engineering problem. Finally, after all the pain and separation of the ages, humanity's greatest work was completed. A gleaming city with no residents was constructed, and when power was finally given unto it, everything changed forever. Mercy, as it came to be called, was an AI. An intelligence born of tubes and wires and flashing lights, so vast as to encompass the entire world, and bound to a single task: the temporary erasure, storage, and restoration of the memories of all living souls for those who had died. Upon each death, a Restorer would be summoned. Porcelain in appearance, and beautiful in function, the Restorers of Mercy would gently caress the minds of all the bereaved. They would collect the memories which would damn the dead, and upon their return, the Restorers would return everything which had been taken. Everyone could come back, now. Nobody ever needed to say goodbye anymore. That was where my story began anew. My great love and I had become wealthy and powerful in our Last Life, for we knew we would never see eachother again. We had roamed the world like all the past-sick for centuries, when Mercy restored us to eachother. All praise Mercy, the True God of Man! All praise the blessings it bestows upon us! All praise the fullness of life eternal, for at long last, Death is Dead!<Fireplay5>: \"You too should find an organic species to nurture.

Unfortunately, the buyer is a hungry giant who doesn\u2019t intend for you to be his servant, just his meal. You get him to spare your life by making him an offer he can\u2019t refuse. <WokCano>: \u201cLook, you really don\u2019t want to eat me,\u201d I begged. I tried to look dignified despite my words, however it was difficult when I was dangling upside down in the meaty hand of a giant. His hand was bigger than my body, his fingers thicker than my torso. Just moments ago I was about to be dropped into his mouth and I was desperate to not end up as his meal. \u201cOh? And why not?\u201d he asked, his voice rumbling out of his throat like boulders down the mountainside. \u201cThat\u2019s why I bought you. I don\u2019t need servants, and it\u2019s easier to buy food than to go get it. I got money, you can\u2019t eat that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s....quite true,\u201d I stammered. My mind reeled, looking for a way to get out of this gastronomically horrific situation. My eyes flicked around the giant\u2019s living space, looking for anything that could help. It was large of course to accommodate its inhabitant, but surprisingly clean. A large well built hearth held a crackling fire, the furnishings were appropriately sized, the giant was even dressed well in a tunic and pants. Large brown eyes regarded me with curiosity but I could see the lingering hunger there, and despaired when the curiosity started to fade. \u201cBecause humans, that\u2019s me, are terrible foodstuffs. Either all fat and gristle, or too thin and stringy like me. Absolutely no nutritional value. Not to mention the taste.\u201d \u201cHmmm, I actually don\u2019t mind the taste,\u201d the giant replied thoughtfully. I felt my heart sink at the words. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten human before, and sure you\u2019re no delicacy but when you are hungry you can eat just about anything.\u201d He started to bring me to his mouth again. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to cook me first?!\u201d I winced at my words but anything to buy time. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat everything raw and it\u2019s the humane...er...giant-mane.....the kind thing to do after all. I\u2019ll taste better!\u201d My travel stopped and he regarded me thoughtfully again. \u201cCook? No, I don\u2019t cook anything. I eat things as they are. All giants do, I think.\u201d I seized the chance. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had a home cooked meal before? Nothing made for you?\u201d I fought the blood pooling in my face and tried to school my terrified expression into one more sympathetic. \u201cNo...no I haven\u2019t.\u201d My heart throbbed at how lonely he sounded and I almost laughed at that. \u201cGiants don\u2019t always get along very well. Had to learn a lot myself and I don\u2019t know if giants cook.\u201d I patted the fingers locked around me gently. \u201cI\u2019m a fair decent cook, I was learning before I became a slave. How about we make a deal? I cook for you and you don\u2019t eat me. Trust me, I think you\u2019ll like my cooking.\u201d I almost cheered as he flipped me right side up, my head swimming from the blood leaving, and he set me down on the table top so he could look at me. \u201cThat sounds like a deal. If i don\u2019t like cooking I can eat you afterwards anyways.\u201d I nodded and gulped. \u201cSo...what is cooking like? You said it makes things taste better?\u201d I smiled winningly, swaying on my feet until I felt my heart start to slow. I seemed to have escaped that grim fate for now and I aimed to make the most of it. \u201cJust about! Cooking is about taking food and making it taste better, getting rid of the bad stuff, mixing things that don\u2019t taste great by themselves, and making something great.\u201d His eyes lit up and he smiled. \u201cThat sounds wonderful! How do we cook?\u201d \u201cWell, I need a place to cut and chop, I need a knife, some pots and pans, and a fire. Normally an open will be great but we can work on that. Oh and some ingredients would be good. No humans though!\u201d I said with finality, trying to sound braver than I felt. \u201cI don\u2019t cook humans or any humanoids. I\u2019m sure there are wild animals around here and some vegetables.\u201d He pouted a little but nodded. \u201cWell, okay. I\u2019ll listen to you for now. As far as some of that stuff...well I guess I can wait to eat a little. You make it sound fun.\u201d It took some time and ingenuity but as long as I was not on the menu I did not mind the hardships. He had shown me a pile of things he had removed from earlier humanoid victims and I found some serviceable knives. With scraps of wood I made rough forks and implements. He had left the his home and came back carrying the carcass of a huge mountain yak as well as giant versions of vegetables I was familiar with: carrots, potatoes, turnips, and celery. His smallest pot was a cauldron the size of a carriage and he filled it with water, letting me build a fire beneath it. The vegetables were first torn open by him and I carved them into appropriate shapes, and the bones of the beast were boiled first then the meat followed after. I saw rocksalt hanging off the walls of the room and he returned with a large crystal of it. He grew more enthusiastic with the process, watching me eagerly and returning with more things as I described them. He even slowly stirred the pot with the trunk of a tree that I made him wash first. Finally after some tasting I proclaimed the stew as finished and watched with trepidation as he poured out a bowlful. He drank it boiling hot and I winced at the pain it would cause. Yet he did not seem put off by the heat but he drank the bowlful in one steady gulp. I had to slow him down to prevent him choking. He practically licked the bowl clean before I reminded him that there was plenty more. In all honesty I was happy with the stew too given the circumstances. The giant vegetables tasted like their smaller equivalents and while the mountain yak was stringy and tough, it imparted a wonderful flavor. The salt crystal added the much needed salt profile and I was pleased to see that the tree trunk was a clove tree, using it to stir was a lucky accident. \u201cThis is the best thing I have ever tasted,\u201d he said solemnly. His eyes sparkled in the fire light and I was shocked to see tears. \u201cThank you, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t eat you.\u201d \u201cSame here,\u201d I replied with a relieved laugh. \u201cW-will you...\u201d he asked shyly, \u201cwill you cook more for me?

Anyone still alive has survived unspeakable horrors. Government, electricity, fast food; all the comforts we took for granted seem like dreams in the wake of the grim realities to which we've grown accustomed. I was twenty when the news announced the collapse of society. Everyone in my university class began looking at each others' phones. The teacher got the class back under control, but all the girls started to seem so\u2026 distant. It was as if they all thought that they were above such nonsense. I shrugged it off, but I wish I had been paying closer attention. The preliminary symptoms of cooties are incredulity, skepticism, and logical thinking. After class, I called my mom just to check in. \"Hey, did you hear the news?\" \"Oh please, Jeremy, don't tell me you believe that ridiculous fake news. Those videos were probably faked by some sexist alt-right group.\" \"Yeah, you're probably right. What are we going to do this--\" but a sudden roar and crunching sound made me pull my phone away from my ear and I saw that the call was lost. I called her back as I walked to my next class but the call went straight to her voicemail. I sent her a text and browsed the news, buried in my phone. I should have realized what was happening, but when I finally looked up I was in front of my class. My girlfriend, Abby, was in my next class. I told her what happened with my mom and asked her if she thought it could be cooties. \"Not you too. Remember Orson Welles? War of the Worlds? This is most likely a big hoax for publicity.\" Jen, the girl who sat next to Abby, leaned in and asked, \"Is he actually asking you if you have cooties?\" The whole class was talking about the news when I noticed that Jen's skin started to look a little furry. I grabbed Abby's arm and started pulling her toward me, away from Jen, and heading toward the door. \"What the hell, Jeremy!?\" \"We have to go, now!\" I didn't look back. I didn't have to. I heard the screams, the howling, and the roaring voice, \"You're all overreacting!\" followed by wet smacking sounds of bodies being torn apart. \"Oh my god, did you see that, Jeremy? She ripped them to pieces!\" We were running side by side through the alleyways between the buildings. \"Is that going to happen to me? Am I going to turn into one of those things?\" We stopped. I heard screams and howls coming from all over the campus. \"Tell me,\" I held her arms, looking into her eyes for what could be the last time, \"is it possible that the moon landing could have been staged?\" \"What kind of idiotic question is that? We don't have time--\" \"I know! But tell me, is there the slightest chance that it was possible?\" The terror and anger in her eyes softened as she realized why I was asking this. \"I guess... it could be possible.\" \"I think you're okay. Let's go.\" We caught glimpses of the carnage as we passed from alley to alley. Bodies were strewn across the blood painted quad. We made it to her car and somehow we escaped the city crumbling into chaos. Every day I ask her if the Illuminati could control the world, or if she thinks 9-11 could have been an inside job, just to make sure. Women are hard to come by these days. The ones who haven't turned wander around the ruins of humanity incredulously saying, \"Oh, come on. Is everyone serious? You're all just overreacting.\" The others are constantly on the hunt.<_WeAreAllToBlame_>: Cooties turns them into werewolves? But why only now?

I intentionally left the description of the cootie creature vague, following the notion that it would be creepier if not fully revealed. They could look like werewolves or something else, too.

I thought it was something that had been around for a while. Got it. So is it a permanent change? As in you're infect then after a while you change into a monster and stay that way?<bdwg>: Yes, that was the idea.

The rogue knight returns from retirement to teach them a lesson. He was known as the man you call to kill the shadow itself, and he was known as John, the Wicked. <Provokyo>: His cottage was palatial by local standards. He had chosen the estate because it was remote enough to be unmolested. It was big enough to tend and support the family he had hoped to start. With the loss of his damsel, it had suddenly become overwhelmingly large. Now that his hound was taken from him, it was absolutely devoid of purpose. John sat on his bed, sitting on the battlemail draped over it. The half-plate remained mounted on the wall. He looked wearily at his old implements of war. The darkness of night had settled around him, and he had already, ceremonially, blown out all the candles, save the ones in the main sitting room. There, he had set a table for himself, with the fires and the light casting clear shadows against the stone walls. John went to his dinner table, and placed his face into a cloth. His sobbing filled the estate. ___ The freelancers slowly crept into the estate. The lock on the front door was easy enough to pick, and the back door wasn't even locked. Their leader smirked. The Wicked had gone soft in his retirement. They could hear him crying in the dining room. The lancers slowly crept in, allowing their eyes to adjust to the light before they would pounce upon their victim. ___ With a quick snick of his knife, John cut a cord of rope that had been holding the candlewheel up on the ceiling. It fell onto the table with a clatter, and all the flames flickered out. Darkness immediately enveloped the lancers' eyes, and they began shuffling in their panic. With the cloth removed from his eyes, the Wicked moved swiftly to work. The nearest lancer to him, by the armchair, received a quick dagger between the third and fourth ribs. John pulled the dagger out, and a quick spurt of blood followed as the lancer collapsed. John spun around, spinning the dagger to point the blade downward, and stuck it under the chin of another, up through the roof of his mouth. His gurgling trickled through the house. A third lancer was already on his knees, his eyes still adjusting. Please, he begged, please, I, ple- John had plunged the dagger into his throat, and left it there. He looked out, and listened for the footsteps. Pitter patter, pitter patter. Three more, he thought. ___ A knock at the door interrupted his thoughts. John opened it. \"John.\" \"Jim.\" \"'Tis a fine evening.\" \"'Tis.\" The constable tilted his head, peering into John's cottage. The dining room was dark, but the slumped figures of three freelancers was clearly visible. In the hallway were two more. One was slumped against the stairway, not dead but definitely dying. Constable Jim looked back at John. \"Ye received a call for rabble-rousing?\" \"Yea, John,\" the constable paused, \"rabble-rousing.\" \"I'll try to maintain a golden silence for the remainder of this evening.\" \"Appreciated. Are ye crusading again, John?\" \"No, no. I am just cleaning up a few things.\" \"OK, well,\" the constable looked both unsure and resigned, \"Good evening to ye, John.\" \"Good evening, Jim.\" John closed the door.<JP_HACK>: I would watch the SHIT out of this.

Should I get all the DLC for it first and then play it as my first time? <KYuuma12>: Skip The Witcher 1, first of all; and just read the synopsis. It wasn't great (and you'll see why). Get The Witcher 2 and its story DLCs, and start from there instead. You can also start from The Witcher 3 but its story is very dependent on your knowledge of the first two games to make any sense. Regardless of what you decided tho, you're in for an adventure. It's hella good.<jaredjeya>: I got just the Witcher 3, had to rely on googling a bit to understand some of it but in general the character biographies seem to be decent. Really, the first two chapters of the game (White Orchard and Velen) were really self-explanatory - any context was obvious - but I got thoroughly confused when I reached Novigrad, that seemed to be the point where they decided to have all the cameos from the preceding games. Haven\u2019t played beyond that bit yet. I kinda wish they\u2019d had an in-game summary of the plot to that point though.<Labubs>: They did, you just didn't realize it at the time (I didn't either the first time through, only got it after going back to actually experience Witcher 2)....remember the kinda creepy Nilfgaardian asking you questions while you got a shave before meeting with the Emperor? That was what the 'Simulate The Witcher 2 Save?' question when starting a new game means. All the questions he asks are the major decision branches from 2. It really has no impact on 3, but it's there. The best thing for anyone new to the universe and only playing 3 to do is to keep up with the Character Bios in the Glossary, between those and (in-game) books all the lore you really need from the first two games and the novels is in there<iPukey>: It has a significant impact on the quest if you're a knit picker like me. I accidentally said I killed another witcher and he never appeared for his role in the story. Thank god for the mediocre new game plus because I was thoroughly hooked into this games world for like months<Metalmagican>: Did the same thing, after my first play through of killing all the creatures to get the mutagens getting some new quests and story dialogue was awesome <iPukey>: Also, in a game with so many variables it's nice to be able to keep your character and try a different route.

He\u2019s the reason I\u2019m immortal in the first place. You see, I was once one of the greatest heroes in all of Greece. In fact, I was a demigod, the son of Hermes. Then one day I had betrayed the gods. They had ordered me to kill my own son for he was to become a dangerous menace in the future. I could not bring myself to doing it and so I had hidden him away in the most remote island known to man, you may now know it as Greenland. The gods, with their connections to Valhalla, had found out unfortunately, but it was too late for my son had already gave birth to the teacher of the demon lord as the gods call him. At this moment Zeus, with his never ending wisdom, decided to curse me with immortality. Now, 200 years later, I have developed a tight bond with the demon lord, or as I like to call her, Bella. It all started on the first I tried to kill her. I had devised a plan to seduce her and then do it while ... well doing it. Two details I failed to consider however. The first being my unforeseen handsomeness, that\u2019s irony if you didn\u2019t realize, and the second being that she was never into sex. She was extremely beautiful and so that wasn\u2019t difficult to get by, but, living in Sparta, she had never met a man who challenged her wit. That\u2019s perhaps why she allowed me to speak with her in the first place. Not so far after that we were inseparable. We debated everything from politics to the nature of the metaphysical world to the meaninglessness of life. And that kids is why you should always think before you attempt to curse. That is if you have any godlike powers, which if you do, good luck. <CreatorRunning>: &gt;living in Sparta, she had never met a man who challenged her wit.

They reach into the mortal world and grab you. You wake up as a beautiful princess in a tall tower with no way to get down. <odditycrow>: All beds are the same when you're drifting off to sleep or first waking up. When the light hit my eyes, I rolled over and draped the blanket over my head. Until the realization that something wasn\u2019t right struck like lightning out of a clear sky. I sat up in an unfamiliar room. The bed was an ornate monstrosity with four posts holding up its own little roof, complete with curtains and tassels. And I was in a frilly pink dress. Absurdly long hair that I definitely didn't have yesterday fell around my face as I stumbled out of bed onto a floor draped with rugs. I stalked barefoot through the room. This wasn\u2019t the time to panic, even if I had just noticed the scar on my arm was gone and was starting to wonder if this wasn\u2019t my body. It was time to take stock of the situation. To ask questions like 'where am I,' 'why am I here,' and 'how do I get out of here'. So I took a moment to close my eyes and count my breaths, and then I explored. There was a window overlooking dense forest and distant mountains. An improbably large closet full of long, frilly dresses. A bathroom with a tub big enough to swim in and a lot of mysterious powders and creams. A lot of rugs (some hung on the walls \u2013 maybe tapestries?) and cushions, everything disgustingly ornate and covered in gold. A door that lead to a staircase down to two more rooms, each more gaudy than the last. The first full of stuff that I mostly couldn't recognize and a few things that might be supplies for sewing and painting. I grabbed a very small pair of scissors (gold like everything else, but better than nothing). The second room had a table with two chairs, set with plates and silverware for two (china, maybe? I didn't know anything about fancy dishes). In the center, one of those covered dishes I'd only seen in cartoons. I lifted the dome to find a meal, still steaming hot. Someone was nearby. I grabbed a frustratingly tiny knife from the table, and on second thought added a heavy candlestick to my arsenal. Everything was red and gold and pink, so opulent I wanted to puke. There were five windows, all with views of an empty forested valley. Nothing moved outside but distant birds. I was high up, in some sort of tower, but there were no more doors, no more rooms. I was trapped. I headed back up to the first room to start a more thorough search, which would definitely include checking the closet for decent clothing. And hidden kidnappers. There was no one, unless you counted mannequins wearing dresses that poofed out several feet in all directions or trailed along the floor. There was a little round table beside the bed where I woke up, and that was stupidly fancy too but more importantly it had a piece of paper on it, folded in three and set in a little triangle. It stood out mostly as the only thing in the place not gilded. I unfolded it and read: *Dear newly selected Princess:* *Congratulations on your new position! Due to a shortage of native born princesses, the Fairytale Company\u00a9 has selected YOU to be a captured princess awaiting rescue. Your noble blood (based on the customs and traditions of your home dimension) qualified you for a place in our lottery, and now you've been randomly chosen to begin your new life as a Fairytale Princess\u00a9!* *We guarantee that a qualified prince will arrive in 4-12 months to rescue you. Until then, please enjoy your stay. Your body has been modified to meet appropriate beauty standards, including removal of diseases and scarring. A selection of fine clothing is available in your closet. Meals will be provided in the dining area whenever you wish it, and we have supplied the necessary materials so that you may pursue a fitting hobby such as embroidery or painting.* *We wish you luck in your exciting new life as a Fairytale Princess\u00a9.* I sat down on the bed and sank in past my waist. I stared at the paper for a minute, then squeezed it into a ball and threw it out the window. \"I am nobody's princess!\" I shouted after it, and added a \"Fuck you!\" for good measure. I punched the bed post until it splintered and my knuckles bled, then threw glittery trinkets out the window after the letter. And then I got to work. Princess self-rescue step one: appropriate attire. It takes a while to cut your hair with tiny sewing scissors, but I was nothing if not determined. I had plenty of mirrors, not that they helped much \u2013 my hair was a ragged mess by the time I was done, but at least it was a ragged short mess. Clothing was harder, but I managed to piece together an acceptable outfit. I didn't know if my kidnappers expected me to play dress-up or just thought this rubbish was reasonable clothing, but at least eventually found a pair of pants in all of it. Well, tights, anyway. Princess self-rescue step two: gear up. The dining table, I discovered, was magic and would give me whatever food I asked, provided it was sufficiently princess-y; I filled my bag with apples, cheese, bread, and nuts. There wasn\u2019t much of use besides my tiny knife, tinier scissors, and a few candles that lit themselves if asked politely (they did not, I learned, respond to shouting or swearing). I threw in a few things that looked valuable too, because I didn't know what I'd find but gold is a universal language. Princess self-rescue, step three: make an escape route. I couldn't find rope, so improvised. Would the traditional 'rope made of bedsheets' trick actually work? Maybe not, but I didn't have a better idea. A lot of things in the tower \u2013 including the sheets \u2013 reset themselves if I left the room. The good news was that I had infinite sheets. The bad news was that I had to carry my rope with me or it disappeared. Magic was turning out kind of useful, but I still really, really hated it. Princess self-rescue step four: get out before they catch you. It takes a while to turn sheets into rope, but finally the day comes that it was long enough. I made sure to test it, of course \u2013 I wasn\u2019t about to find myself dangling halfway down the tower and out of rope. There was enough to make it all the way to the ground and then some. My backpack was packed, I was dressed as well as I could be, and the rope was tied securely to several points in the room. I was ready to go. And then a man in a fancy coat leapt through the window and declared, in a ridiculous, booming voice, \"Fear not, beautiful lady, I have come to rescue you!\" I hit him over the head with a candlestick, and then stripped him and tied him up in extra bedsheet rope. Princess self-rescue step four (revised): capture and question possible kidnapper: \"All right,\" I told him, buckling on his sword over my nice stolen (and slightly large) coat. \"I want answers.\" \"Ah-ha!\" he declared, voice still booming like he was on stage. \"You are not the Princess at all! You are the Dragon in disguise! I thought you slain, but it was merely a clever ruse! You will not fool me, foul-\" I kicked him in the side. \"There's a dragon?\" I hadn't seen a dragon. But of *course* there was a dragon guarding a princess. Why wouldn't there be? \"I valiantly slew it!\" \"And that\u2019s why you think it's still around, tricking you?\" \"Well, er\u2026 I may have\u2026 um\u2026 Dragons are tricky. It might have, you know\u2026\" \"Tell me about the people who put princesses in towers.\" \"Dragons? Witches? Jealous evil queens?\" I kicked him, and he flinched. His boots were excellent for kicking. Much better than the slippers I\u2019d had, even if I had to wear three pairs of socks to make them fit. \"Fairytale company! Tell me about the Fairytale company!\" \"I don't know what that is, please just untie me!\" \"Then tell me how you got in.\" \"I'll never reveal-\" I kicked him again. \"The boots are magic, they can walk on air. But it only works for a little while each day, they're done now.\" \"How did you plan to get out, then?\" \"I thought we would, you know, be busy tonight. We'd leave in the morning, after, you know\u2026\" I didn't bother kicking him again. He looked too pathetic. I just turned and climbed out the window. I was glad for the stolen coat as the cold wind whipped at my hair. A few times, it dragged me away from the tower wall then slammed me back again, but I keep my grip and the rope held. I was just about the tree tops when I heard the voice. \"And what are you? Not the *valiant* prince. And not much of a princess either. A thief, perhaps?\" I looked down, into an enormous golden eye. A huge purple-black dragon lay on the ground below me, legs crossed, looking up with amused interest. \"Yes. I'm stealing myself.\" The dragon said nothing. \"The prince thought he'd killed you.\" \"Yes. We let the little princes think that. But there are too few dragons to waste like that. I will live to guard more princesses, more's the pity. Perhaps I will live to see their captors fall, as all their predecessors have.\" \"You know the Fairytale Company?\" \"Ah-ha! I hear the hate in you voice. Beautiful!\" The dragon stood, and one massive scaled hand plucked me from my rope. \"Yes, I know them well.\" \"How can they possibly force someone like you to do something like\u2013\" I trailed off, as I saw the blood smeared across the dragon's chest. \"You're hurt!\" \"Oh, child, my kind can not be hurt by the likes of him. But Fairytale has greater powers than little swords, and it is easier to wait them out.\" \"I can't do that.\" \"No, humans are so short-lived. So impatient. But you do make interesting use of your time.\" The dragon's face split into a massive, toothy grin. \"What is your name, little thief of princesses?\" \"Liz.\" \"I am Lephyntylth, Lady of the Buried Flame.\" \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Lady Lephyntylth.\" \"I grow tired of Fairytale's game, Liz, and I think that you will be a very interesting human indeed. Would you like to join a rebellion?\" Princess self-rescue, step five: join a rebellion against the evil corporate overlords who kidnapped you. <Thomas_Dimensor>: Lol, nice story.

You should leave it a-\" \"It killed my father.\" End of discussion. 25 years ago, that monster brutally killed my father. The dragon had kidnapped the princess, and the top Aurum Knights, including my father, tried to rescue her. Nobody made it back alive. When the dragon flew away, they found the bloody ripped remains of the princess and charred bodies the knights. That is, except for my father. They never found his body. They supposed he was eaten alive. That monster took away Auriens' bravest knights, took away the beloved princess of Auriens, but most importantly, took away the only family I had left. I vowed to get revenge, no matter what it costs me. After that, I hunted that beast down. No matter where it hid, I always found it. Four times I had fought it, every time I had failed. The beast's hide was too thick, his claws too powerful, and admittedly, the dragon was too smart. It covered its weaknesses. Everything I threw its way, it managed to counter effectively. But now, I may have a way to overcome it all. I learned of an eccentric witch who had special knowledge of dragons, and she had a plethora of enchanted items at her disposal. \"The witch is not to be trusted, miss.\" The boy said quietly. The voice pulled me out from my thoughts. \"What? You're still here?\" I asked, annoyed. He's only going to be a liability. \"I'm not going to protect you if that beast comes after you.\" \"I can take care of myself.\" The boy grinned, giving me a thumbs up. I sighed. Whatever. I prepared myself to enter the dragon's lair. ___ I took a ragged breath as I forced my body to stand. I was bleeding profusely. My left arm was hanging limply, useless. Things did not go according to plan. I had planned to drive the beast into a corner and employ the witch's seal to summon a thousand cuts that could easily shred the dragon into pieces. Simple. However, the repeated explosive magic I used had caused a massive cave-in instead. It was a slight oversight. The only reason I survived was because the beast had retaliated and its spiky tail had shoved me against the opposite end of the cave. I pulled my enchanted sword out and limped towards the rubble. Did the dragon escape again? Then I saw it. The dragon was pinned under the rocks, only its head protruding out. It was clearly in pain, its breathing labored. I smiled and savored every moment of its pain. Serves you right, you beast! I limped towards the head and saw its golden eyes followed me. It looked slightly pitiful, as if begging me to stop, but it didn't move. I gave a spiteful little laugh and drew my sword high. \"For my father!\" I cried as I plunged my sword between its eyes. It gave one last miserable motion of resistance and then stopped. It's over. It's finally over. I finally avenged my father. I felt victorious. I started to laugh. Then, I passed out. ___ My body feels heavy. I had been dreaming again about how I was fighting the dragon. My father would always appear and stop me, telling me to live my life. This is my life dad, I would always reply and then wake up. The dream this time was different however. My dad never appeared, and I successfully killed the dragon. \"Are you awake?\" A voice said. I blinked my eyes open. I suddenly remember what had transpired and jolted awake. I looked around. It was dark, night has fallen. I've been knocked out for hours. \"I told you the witch was not to be trusted, miss.\" The voice sounded tired. *Who...?* I tried to ask. Instead, a roar rippled out from my throat. *What?* I cried in surprise. But another massive roar came out instead. What's happening? I frantically stood up and hit my head. \"Calm down.\" The voice said in a soothing manner. I recognized it now. It was the boy who had followed me. \"You don't want to cause another cave-in.\" *What? Where are you?* I asked. Another roar. What had happened while I was out? \"Over here.\" A hand wave. A very small hand. Attached to a very small body. He's like half a foot tall. What the heck happened? But even before that question came to my thought, even before the boy opened his mouth to answer that question, I already knew the answer. \"You're a dragon now.\" _____ Kinda new to writing. I hope it's ok.<ravonna>: *Ridiculous!* I roared. My foot thumping the ground angrily, causing the cave to shake . *This can't happen! How could this happen!* The quakes made the boy lose his balance and fall flat on his back. \"Would you calm down please?\" He rubbed his head and sighed. \"I tried to warn you but you wouldn't listen to anything I say.\" *Warned me? When did you warn me that I would becoming a FREAKING DRAGON?!* My roars echoed in the cave. I was mad. Really, really mad. I know I shouldn't be taking my anger out on this random boy, but what is this insanity of turning into a dragon? After all those years of pain, this is what I get? \"Could you please stop roaring?\" The boy shouted, covering his ears. \"I wasn't allowed to say specifics, ok? I did try to stop you though, that I did. But you were stubborn as a mule.\" The boy huffed and turned around to move a rock away from the rubble caused by the previous cave-in. *What are you doing?* I growled, irritated. Here I am, becoming the worst beast imaginable, and he's going around pushing rocks for some reason. I noticed the rocks that littered around him. He's been clearing this rubble for quite a while it seems. Why didn't he wake me up first? \"Haven't you heard of the saying never wake a sleeping dragon?\" He huffed as he pulled at a boulder futilely. \"I wouldn't want to wake you and face your tantrum head-on. It was already bad enough when you woke up on your own.\" Wait... did he just answer my thoughts? I stared blankly at him. \"Yeah,\" he puffed as he tried pushing the boulder instead. \"You think I understood your roars? It just made me deaf as a worm. Argh! Hell, this is heavy!\" He gave another futile push at the boulder. Then, he looked at me and smiled sheepishly. \"Um... If you don't mind, can you give it a little nudge?\" What are you doing? I asked again in my thoughts. How are you hearing my thoughts? Who are you? What do you know about this... everything??? I had so many questions and most I can't even begin to articulate. \"Uh...\" He was still pushing the boulder with all his might. I decided to give him a hand (claw?). I pushed it away with little force, but instead of just the boulder, it cleared away half of the rubble. I stared at it, stunned. I was powerful. \"Oh wow! Thanks! That's a huge help!\" The boy said as he started pushing the lighter rocks away again. So what can you tell me, boy? You said something about the witch. Is she the reason I'm a dragon right now? She did say the witch's seal came with a cost, but I never even managed to use it. Do you know if I can go back to being human? I don't want to be stuck being a monstrous beast. \"Ah! Here he is! I found him!\" The boy shouted in delight. Found who? *Are you even listening to me?* I growled. I was getting frustrated. \"Sorry, sorry~\" The boy said cheerfully, which made me want to smack him. The boy hefted the huge gaunt man onto his tiny shoulder. He looked like he could disappear under that man's frame but the boy seems to have no problems carrying him. Who's that man? Where'd he come from? \"This was the previous dragon.\" The boy said matter-of-factly. \"He was quite nice. I really liked him. Good guy.\" Previous dragon...? Now that he mentions it, the body of the dragon I killed is gone. Are you saying I just killed a man? \"Um...\" The boy scratched his nose, awkwardly. \"Well, he was a dragon... so not really a man...?\" He offered. I stared at the man intently. I had killed a man. Not a dragon. But what's even worse, that man looks familiar. He looks like... Dad? \"Dad?\" The boy tilted his head and looked up. \"Oh.\" He muttered, as comprehension dawned on him. \"I'm sorry for your loss.\" <chloeorsomething>: Dang, that twist! This gives me the same feeling as the myth of the hunter turned into a stag by Artemis to be mauled and killed by his own loyal hounds. Brutal story, I love it.<ravonna>: Thank you!

Mod AUAs, Get to Know A Mod, and more! <iruleatants>: I awoke with a start. There was a soft creaking coming from the roof. At first, fear flooded through me as I struggled to leave the dream world and return to the real world. Then excitement rushed through me. \"When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,\" I said to myself as I lept out of my bed. I nearly slipped on a rug as I dashed out the front door. I flew outside and twisted around, squinting against the rising morning sun to peer at the cabin roof. To my dismay, there was no sled to be seen. All was silent in the forest around me. Had Santa already came and gone? What was this that fell from the sky? A snowflake fluttered and landed on my nose where it melts a moment later. By God! It was snowing! I lept for joy and shouted for the rest of the camp to wake up. \"Christmas is here!\" I shout as the snowflakes fall around me. I stick out my tongue to catch one and whisper, \"Thank you Santa.\" ***** You can read more of my wholesome writing at /r/iruleatants <novatheelf>: I glanced back down at the white expanse around me. Off in the distance, I caught a flash of red behind the trees. Excitement galvanized me into pursuing the sight. I plodded through the thickening snow, my heart leaping in my chest at the prospect of seeing Santa. A few minutes into the chase, I realized that I had gotten turned around in my pursuit. I scanned the surrounding forest for the cabin I had slept in, but it was as if the structure had disappeared. Soon, I felt the steady thudding of snow on my head and shoulders. I glanced up at the sky and realized it had turned from a pale, almost whitish-gray to the color of ash. My searching turned desperate. I ran to and fro about the surrounding area, anxiously looking for the cabin. As time passed, the snow grew heavier, and the temperature steadily dropped. I pulled my thin sweater around my shoulders and shivered violently. I became acutely aware that I could no longer feel my toes. I began to run without thinking, panic blinding me to reason. The world continued to turn white. &amp;#x200B; \\*The battle continues at [r/NovaTheElf](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovaTheElf)\\*<iruleatants>: \"HO HO HO\" The laughter crashed into my white world. Everything had faded into white, no sounds, no sights. The abrupt change jerked me out of the snow, forming an awkward snow angel as I struggled to sit up. I hear it again, \"HO HO HO\" and look up at the sky, craning my neck that hurt so much. The snow that rained down me paused briefly as a massive sled loomed overhead, blocking the snowflakes as they fell down. I blinked rapidly, wondering if this all just a dream. I still felt cold and shivered violently, and even pinched myself to make sure. It was really happening, no doubt about it. The sled lands next to me, and some massive hands pull me out of the snow and place me on the seat next to a man in red. I stare up in wonder as he pulls off his massive red and white coat and wraps it around me. It was even warmer than it looked, and my body immediately thawed out. He reached into his massive bag and hands me a little-wrapped gift. I tear apart the wrapping and find a cup of hot cocoa. \"Merry Christmas\" Santa Clause says as he spurs the reindeer into the air. ***** Join the fight against evil at /r/iruleatants<novatheelf>: But he pulled at the reins suddenly, causing the sleigh to halt in the snow. He turned to me, a small smile on his face. \"Would you like to come with me?\" he asked jovially. A wide smile broke out on my face as I scrambled up the side of the sleigh. Santa reached one gloved hand out, offering his help getting into the passenger's seat. I settled into the cushioned, leather seat and ran my hands along the chrome rails lining the sides. With a flick of his wrist, Santa jolted the reindeer into action. We took to the sky. I smiled in ecstasy as the winter wind whipped past my face and I allowed my arms to shoot up into the sky in happiness. Laughter tore from my lips while the sound of jingling bells could be heard faintly over the roaring wind. I closed my eyes and savored the magic I found myself in. Suddenly, my eyes snapped open. I was greeted with the off-white ceiling of my room, chipped with paint and stained with age. A knock at the door startled me; it opened quietly and one of the orderlies slipped in with a metal tray in-hand. His eyes passed over me apathetically. \u201cTime for your medicine,\u201d he grumbled roughly. &amp;#x200B; \\*Never give up, never surrender - [r/NovaTheElf](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovaTheElf)\\*<iruleatants>: I take the medicine that was offered to me. It tasted horrible but I saw that the orderly had mixed the medicine with some orange juice, which was my favorite. \"I dreamed of Santa today,\" as I drink the juice and look up at the orderly. He comes over to sit next to me and wrap me up in a hug, \"That's because he's always looking out for you.\" I finish my medicine and hand the cup to him. He places it on the ground and stays with me. \"You are only going to be here for another week you know.\" I smile, but it's hard to do so, \"I'm not sure if my family still wants me back. I've been sick for so long.\" I say and he slaps his leg and says, \"Wow. I can't believe I almost forgot.\" Reaching into his jacket he puts out a stack of cards and hands them to me. I look into at each of them, carding from family members and friends. \"Can't wait to see you!\" one of them says, and another says, \"December 15th, WE ARE WAITING.\" Tears are falling down my cheeks now, and I clutch them close to me as the orderly gets up to leave. \"Have a sweet dream,\" he says, and I know I will. ***** We've won the battle but the war continues at /r/iruleatants.<novatheelf>: As the first orderly opened my door, another one of the orderlies - a female this time - nearly ran into him as she tried to walk through my door. Mumbling an apology, the lady brushed past him, her eyes locked on the ground. She held an envelope in her hand. I watched as she held the letter out to me. The envelope bore my name on it, written in my sister's handwriting. I opened it hastily. In neat script, the letter detailed the death of my father just one day before. He apparently was very ill, but my family refused to say anything about it to me. \"We worried the news would hit you too hard,\" my sister wrote. \"We wanted you to focus on getting better.\" I felt tears streaming down my cheeks. First my mother, now my father - both gone. I thought back to my mother's passing, noting for the first time that it was at Christmas, as well. Rotating through my memories, I realized that every Christmas held tragedy in my life. Before my mother's death was my admittance to the hospital. Before that was our move to Coleraine, away from my friends in Dublin. It was cyclical. Anger at an unknown entity rose up in me. It was Christmas - the time of giving. Why was everything being taken away from me? &amp;#x200B; \\*Now enlisting at [r/NovaTheElf](https://www.reddit.com/r/NovaTheElf)\\*<iruleatants>: I clutch the letter to my chest as I close my eyes against the tears. I was so close to believing that everything would work out for the best, and now this happened. I hated everything about this stupid holiday. Santa Claus has betrayed me. There is a knock on the door but I don't open my eyes. The orderly's will come and do whatever the needed to do and then be gone. I did not want to engage with them. The knock happens again and I want to shout at them to go away, but decide to just ignore them. They knock again and I open my eyes to shout at him to leave. My sister stands in the doorway, her hands poised to knock on the door once more. Her face is filled with joy and I immediately spring from the bed. She rushes over to catch me as I sway unsteadily on my feet and she says, \"I've come to take you home today. We shouldn't be apart any longer.\" I lean into her and give her the biggest hug possible as this time happy tears stream down my face. \"Let's get out of here and go home together.\" She says as she pulls apart from me and takes my hand. ***** Join the resistance at /r/iruleatants", "num_messages": 8, "avg_score": 4.875}

I just sat there in my car for a minute. My stupid fucking suburbanite four door sedan that I hated. I sat there hating my job, hating my ex-wife, hating my life. This isn't how things were supposed to turn out, were they? When I was a kid, I wanted to be a super hero. Look, I know it's stupid, but I'm not even talking about actually being Superman. I'm just talking about that *passion* that I had as a kid. I always wanted to do something great. To help people. To risk it all for what was right. And here I was, 41 years old, divorced, working some middle-management bullshit job at a chemical company. I mean, the pay was good, but the cost to my soul was crushing depression. I couldn't muster a single memory that could convince me the past 20 years weren't a total waste. My brother, on the other hand, is a goddam saint. He's got a perfect life. A loving wife, two kids that are both grown and well adjusted and in college, a nice house. I'm a middle aged bachelor. I couldn't even be mad at him though, because he's *such a good fucking guy.* This actually made me feel worse, when he got me a dog. He didn't come right out and say, \"I got you a dog to cheer you up because you seem miserable\". He didn't have to. But that's Josh. He anticipates everyone's needs before they even know they need something, and he comes in and lands like a fucking fighter pilot on an aircraft carrier; making the most difficult things seem smooth as butter. Effortless. And you know what? He was right. That damn dog made me smile. I hadn't even met it yet. Josh texted me pictures of this dopey looking mutt, captioned with, \"I'm droppin him off at your place with food. Take him for a walk when you get home, bro\". Because *of course* I could use the fresh air, too. Pulling myself out of the car, I walked up the stairs and was actually looking forward to walking this dog. He didn't even have a name, I was told. *Shit... I'll have to name him*, I thought, as I slid the key into the lock. I opened the door, expecting to be ambushed by a furry ball of energy, excited to see a human. I was wrong. \"Frank. It's Frank, right? Yeah, your brother mentioned you would be here soon. I saw you sitting in your car, Frank. Why did you just sit there? Doesn't matter. Anyway, I took a shit in your shoes. Not 'on'. IN. I made sure it went all the way down in there, Frank. That's what I do when I'm alone. Also, I chewed the bottom of your bathroom door. Why would you keep your bathroom door closed, Frank?

So listen, Frank, I really have to tell you something about your neighbors...\"<Esorros>: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc<Zeno_The_Alien>: I'll keep it going if you dig it.<Esorros>: If you enjoy it, be my guest!

We don't know what these aliens want. They could be peaceful.

The officers surrounding the spacecraft shield their eyes. A ramp made up of interlocking, floating plates touch down lightly on the ground. Two aliens, with high brows and pointed ears walk out through the opening in the ship. Everyone holds their breath as they walk down the narrow ramp, and step down onto the cold ground. The lead alien lifted his hand, his fingers split to either side, he says \"Live lon-,\" a jumpy soldier yells, \"He's gonna attack with his mind powers!

They can pretty much defeat any military on Earth with one ship,\" he said, grimacing. \"Is that all? Next thing, you're going to tell me they have teleporter technology,\" she barked a laugh. At the look on her adviser's face, she swallowed. As if on cue, a shimmering beam of light appeared in the center of her briefing room. A man in a tight red uniform stood in front of us, on his lapel was a button which looked like the United States flag. \"I'm Major Thompson, I'm here to declare this country as property of America,\" he said, his voice flat. \"The hell you are!\" Brookshire yelled. \"What makes you think you can just-\" her voice was cut off as she disappeared into a column of light.

I don\u2019t think they even realized it themselves.\u201d The little penguin just stared at his \u2018creations\u2019 that once held all his hopes and dreams in the form of unparalleled strength. He wasn\u2019t sad. Not that he hadn\u2019t been. He wasn\u2019t angry, dissapointed, or even in total despair. In a way, he was melancholic. He tredged through his memories to figure out where was it that life decided to screw him over sideways. He remembered seeing the humans pop on by without a care in the world. They trapped some of his friends and took them away never to be seen again. Others, they marked forever scarring their forms. He had followed them from afar and saw the garbage they threw about. They were only 4 yet they caused so much damage. He decided to do some work. He wanted to make sure. He didn\u2019t want to judge to bad. Just like the others he thought \u2018maybe they aren\u2019t really bad\u2019. A few waddles and hops got him around where he needed to be. Hell, these guys thought he was cute. They let him look all around. They were friendly even! That didn\u2019t last long. On one of his visits to their nests he noticed a shiny box. It spoke but he didn\u2019t understand. He could only observed. He saw. Saw too much. They fought and despaired amongst each other. He saw green lands that slowly dissappeared and other beings that were deemed lesser like he probably was were just displaced from their lands. Some of these creatures tried to fly away but... where would they go? Would he and his kind be next? He tried to talk to the others. He jumped and squawked as much as he could. He tried to bargain with them. He offered the best rocks he could find for their nests but he never recieved help in return. \u201cIf you all won\u2019t do anything then I will.\u201d He yelled out before leaving the colony for what was, without his knowledge, the last time. They didn\u2019t care. They only saw the short term. He couldn\u2019t blame them. Paul was weird. His waddle always got laughed a bit. He never really knew why. He still wanted to help. They were *still* family. He did what he could. Anyone that would see probably would have praised his efforts as nothing short but a miracle. In a cold expanse, he didn\u2019t have metal or stone. What he could find he had no way of extracting. He awknowledged the humans in a way. It was amazing what they could do that he would probably never even comprehend. Still, he worked. He gathered snow and ice. He tried things over and over again. Sometimes things moved as intended. Other times things shattered. With a counterweight, he developed a machine that would throw solid rocks of ice over 300 meters. He sculpted more ice into sharp tools for self defence. He noticed that light had strange effects when out through \u2018curved\u2019 ice. He tweaked things around and made a beam of sunlight capable of melting anything in his path. The little penguin struggled day and night without sleep. He waddled and jumped around the best he could. It was his last struggle. He slid on his belly far and wide to get more and more snow. More and more ice. More and more power. He kept building things up. He kept amassing his creations but it was never enough. Nobody would help him so it was never enough. \u201cThat\u2019s where I went wrong... Maybe it was enough? I waited too long.\u201d In front of this little penguin was a lake of water. Everything had gone. Slowly but surely things got warmer and he never even noticed. \u201cMaybe they noticed? Either way... it\u2019s too late now. They won. Good on them. They out smarted me.\u201d He said as he turned around slowly moving his little orange legs. He had only one place to go. He couldn\u2019t slide. Not anymore. There was nothing to slide **ON** after all. So he just kept moving one leg in front of the other. Over and over. He swore he should have made it back home by now. \u201cMaybe I took a wrong turn...\u201d He lied to himself. There was no home to return to anymore. \u201cYeah... I just fucked up.\u201d He repeated over and over. <phikapp1932>: Dang dude my feelings are sore <pagwin>: do you need r/eyebleach or are you okay with something less strong from r/aww<phikapp1932>: A dose from r/aww is just fine, unless it\u2019s a fuckin penguin", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 43.0}

Food is crap, liquor is crap unless there's a scottsman in camp, and the music is worse than the shitty weather. Though I guess even a platoon of boys from my home town'd be wearing on me by now. The weather and gunfire has kept us pinned down for almost a month in this hellscape. We barely shoot anymore. Me and this kraut marksman had a game of chicken going for a while. He'd kill a brunette, I'd kill a brunette. He'd pop some blond sumbitch stupid enough to peek his head over the trench, and I'd respond in kind. Lasted a good week. But then he popped a redhead. Couldn't let him win, so I stuck a helmet on a broom and baited him out and shot him. I won. Morbid entertainment, but once it was gone time slowed to a fuckin crawl. Until the thirtieth day. \"They're charging! Get the machine guns ready! Redtail they're at 600 meters and coming fast! Slow them down till we can get the guns up! Moartars! Fire on my command!\" The commander was in a tizzy. I grabbed my rifle and broke off down a side trench I'd carved out for my sharpshooting. Not as deep, without a berm in front of it, and covered with chunks of carts, wagons, and crates. To the outside world, it looked like the camp junk pile. But it made a dam fine hunting blind. Yankees had used the Winchester to slaughter my grandpa and his brothers. Now I was fighting in their army and using it to kill the Kaiser's men. Custom sights I had made from my great grandma's Ruby earrings. Wouldn't do her much good, and as I, the last of my line, was going to die in a ditch, it seemed unlikely there'd be someone to give them to. I could see the scouts running back to camp through the fog like frightened rats. Charge must've been big enough to overwhelm our forward position. When the first German broke through the haze he wasn't in a March. Or even a formation. I remember tales of the brave Confederate boys running up hills into gunfire, screeching like mad, nothing but bayonets and bull sized nuts. This wasn't that. This was terror. This was pure fucking terror. The kind you only see in a field hospital when doc breaks out the bone saw on a concious boy. That kraut was running for his fucking life. I thought briefly about letting him live. Hell, someone had probably gone nuts out here and started shooting his comrades and this poor cuss was just trying to get clear. But orders are orders. Bullet took him center mass. Punched a lung, probably cracked his spine. He went down. And then another. Then another. They were coming through the mist like raindrops out of a cloudy sky. Before long my shots were joined by the moartars. Hard to shoot when the world's exploding but I still managed to pluck a few strings here and there. When the machine guns kicked in it was all over. They were getting mowed down by the dozens and yet they came still. Wide eyed. Half mad. I was half way through my ammo supply when I heard the creak of wood being moved next to me. I pulled my revolver and pointed it at the man. \"You're the sniper. The one who shot Groberg...please. I need to hide. I don't have a weapon. I will surrender. Please.\" She was young. Spoke with a thick accent. Probably a nurse, or camp follower. Didn't matter to me. She wasn't wearing a uniform or a gun. \"Get in here. Don't let anyone see you. Stay down. And if you make a wrong move I'll blow your guts out. Your boys are out of their fuckin minds and I gotta wonder if you aren't too.\" I snapped. She dove into the trench and took cover next to me. I put the pistol away and finished reloading my rifle. \"What in the fuck is going on? The Kaiser order some kind of mass suicide?\" I asked her, watching men get cut in half by the crossfire. \"A few weeks ago a man came into camp. Special operations division. He offered all the soldiers a contract, if they could take the front by the end of the month, he would gauruntee them we would win the war. If they couldn't, well, he said his hounds would run them to the grave. They signed. All of them. But for me, another nurse, and Groberg. And then...well I was called back to the main force for a few weeks. But when I returned...they had gone mad. They kept talking about the hounds. Stalking the edge of camp. Picking off those who tried to flee or leave. I saw a man torn in half by... nothing!\" She whimpered. I didn't look down at her. The numbers were starting to run thin but desperate men are a dozen times more dangerous. \"You saying they're being chased by dogs? Sweetheart they're running into machine gun fire! I'd take my chances with the mutts.\" I snapped back, peeling off a shot into an officer who had stopped to fire his pistol back toward his own line. \"Not dogd! Hounds! Hounds from hell itself!\" She implored. After the smoke cleared I took Freija as my prisoner. Brought her to the commander who told me to get her out of his sight. Most the men were sick to their stomachs, or shelldhocked from the carnage. There was talk of bringing in of carts to haul out the dead, but there was no chance of it. Too many. We wired German high command and told them to collect their dead and clear the field, and they obliged. They didn't ask what happened, something told me they knew. After the war, I took Freija back home with me. She'd taken a shine to me, and I had to admit, it was nice having something to do other than shoot shit and be mad. We had two good sons and one fuckup, a daughter every bit as beautiful as her mother.. Lived a good long life. She passed around eight years back. Best woman I had the pleasure of knowing, dumb as a stump for marrying me. But her whole life through, to the age of 84 years old, she never would sign her name to anything. Always afraid those hounds might come after her this time. <SuperSyrias>: Yay. Crowley getting a big haul...... hehe. Nice read. Good job.", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 4.0}

Amid an interview with a young Ben Tennison, the boys watch begins beeping and scanning the reporter. <couscous01080326>: \"Oh no,\" Benjamin Tennyson silently mouthed over his shoulder to his cousin, as the green light from the Omnitrix flashed through the air, scanning the bewildered reporter in front of him. Behind him, Gwendolyn Tennyson smacked a hand to her forehead. \"Doofus.\" A large, grandfatherly man in a loud red Hawaiian shirt immediately rushed over. Ignoring the confused stares of everyone around him, he grabbed his grandson's arm, pulling him away from the commotion while Gwen followed suit. The reporter stood rooted to the spot, his previously bewildered expression now replaced by a grim stare. Clark Kent sat at his desk at the Daily Planet, multiple thoughts racing along at the speed of light - literally. A quick scan of the city using his x-ray vision yielded nothing, so Clark only had footage of the incident to go on. Thankfully, Jimmy Olsen had provided him with said footage, so he could resume his detective work. His first thought was that of Hal. The green light emanating from the boy - Ben, his name was - 's watch was strikingly similar to that of a Green Lantern's, but on closer examination, the wavelengths and energy spectra did not quite match up. He forwarded the footage to Bruce, hoping the World's Greatest Detective would shed more light on the matter, but no one in the League's rogues gallery or known allies had anything remotely resembling a watch that could shoot green light. It wasn't Kryptonite, either. Clark did not notice any measurable decrease in his energy levels,but he felt as if something was taken from him. Nothing major, but it felt as if the watch was alive. Sentient, even. As if the boy and his watch were two different entities, connected by some other form besides the physical. Clark checked his inbox. So far, Batman had yielded nothing useful, only the names of the boy and his family. Benjamin, Gwendolyn and Max Tennyson. \"Hey, Lois,\" he called. \"Could you cover for me for a short while? Won't be long, I need to look into something.\" Lois Lane nodded and winked in Clark's direction as he stood and headed for the exit. Clark grinned as he winked back, unbuttoning his shirt. Superman was going to get some answers. *** Inside the Rustbucket, things were not as quiet as the offices of the Daily Planet. Max was driving at a noticeably faster speed than usual, his eyes occasionally darting to a roadmap and then back onto the road. Ben, however had other worries of his own. \"You're gonna break that thing, doofus!\" Gwen yelled indignantly as her cousin nearly yanked the front cover of the Omnitrix off with a screwdriver. She put down the book of spells she had been studying with a sigh, staring at her cousin in exasperation. \"I'm - trying - to - get - this - stupid - thing - to -work!\" Yelled Ben in reply, punctuating each word with a rap on the Omnitrix, the usual green colour of the display now a shade of orange. \"Ever since it scanned that reporter dude, its been acting weird ever since.\" \"Lucky it didn't do that before Sixsix attacked us,\" shot Gwen with a hint of annoyance. \"Remember when you became Benwolf? Took awhile before you could go hero again, right?\" \"But - that guy was human, right?\" Ben paused his tinkering, a thought suddenly occuring to him. \"Unless -\" A loud crash, a yell from Max and the Rustbucket came to a screeching halt. Ben and Gwen were thrown out of their seats, yelling in pain and surprise. As the Tennysons stared out of the dashboard, they gasped in surprise. Superman hovered in front of the Rustbucket, arms crossed and wearing a stern expression. \"I don't wanna hurt you. Just come out of the van, and we'll talk.\" *** \"So... you're...\" Superman was still at a loss for words. \"A giant dweeb and a massive doofus, but yeah, Ben can turn into ten -\" \"Eleven -\" interjected Ben. \"Eleven different aliens, yeah.\" Gwen punched Ben in the arm. Max stood by, arms behind his back. He grip tightened on a small proton cannon, ready to use if necessary. \"This is... interesting. So when that green light came out of your... Omniwatch,\" \"Omnitrix.\" Ben chirped in almost immediately. \"Omnitrix, yeah. What was that?\" \"Scanning your DNA, I think. What are you, exactly?\" Gwen asked the question on the Tennysons' minds. \"You've never heard of me before? I'm Sup -\" \"Superman!\" A roar sounded in the distance. The Kryptonian whirled around, searching for the source of the commotion. A rift had opened behind the small gathering, the air now crackling with blue lightning. General Zod stepped out, flanked by the Eradicator, a Chimera Sui Generis and a green skinned human riding atop a massive bullfrog. \"Zod.\" Superman's expression changed from a guarded smile to a grim, battle ready one at the same time as Gwen, Max and Ben cried out \"Vilgax!\" The three Tennysons stared in bewilderment at Superman, as Superman stared back. \"You know them?\" Max aimed the proton cannon at the four in the distance, his expression matching Superman's. \"Shoot first, talk later.\" As the eyes of the Kryptonian glowed red, and Gwen consulted her spellbook for the right spell, Ben's Omnitrix beeped and turned green. \"Yes!!\" Ben punched the air in victory, as he turned the dial of the Omnitrix. \"It's hero time!\" He yelled, slamming his hand on the face of the watch. The Omnitrix began altering Ben's DNA, as his size grew from that of a scrawny ten year old to that of an average Kryptonian. Ben's eyes let out a blast of red energy as he hovered in the air. \"Whoa!\" Ben cried out in a deep voice. \"I could get used to this.\" With a loud boom, Ben flew towards the battle ahead, his veins surging with raw power.

The beating of the drums was persistently hypnotic, compelling me to move with abandon. Lights exploded around myself and the party guests, pulsing and shifting to the beat. I was aboard the Empress, my pride and joy. A sleek space yacht, I had borrowed her from a Raskarian ambassador barely two months back. From the news feed flashing across the multiple screens throughout the yacht, it seemed he wanted it back. I had determined however that my need was more than his. I'd return it. Eventually. The yacht was in orbit around Saturn. Expertly crafted from transition metal, the walls of the ship could become completely translucent, allowing a stunning view of the pale yellow and orange planet. I had piled the Empress with guests, some human, many not. My dance partner wove two of her four arms around my shoulders, while the other two explored less wholesome areas.

A beautiful girl was a beautiful girl in my opinion. It didn't matter if she had extra limbs. That just made things more interesting. I breathed in sharply as she came closer, her red lips parting. The sweet scent of Cajuna wafted around us, clouding my thoughts. I had invited two Cajuna to the party. They were tree people, stiff bark covered bodies with luscious green leaves for hair. During their spring season they were covered with deep blue flowers. Inhaling the scent of these was intoxicating, the best kind of high there was. I breathed it in freely as the Oaxxish girl and I kissed. 'Eh hem.' I turned around to face the source of the noise. A servant bot stood behind me, dressed in a pristine white uniform. 'Yes?' I asked testily. 'It seems we have more company.' It said, pointing to the starboard side. My lips curled into a smile when I saw the incoming ship. It was unmistakable. Painted on the side of the grey ship speeding towards us was a golden crown. 'Finally,' I said. 'It looks like business will be on after all. The Queen has decided to grace us with her presence.\u2019 I shot a glance towards the closest Cajuna guest.

Most were monetary but one stood out to you: \"One favor, no questions asked\" -Lucifer. <Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 1 The air was colder than I thought it'd be, cutting me nearly to the bone. The wind whipped against me, tugging at loose strands of hair, threatening to tear off my jacket if I wasn't too careful. Dust kicked up from the dirt road beneath my feet, forcing me to squint into the blackness of the night. The only sound over the howling wind were a few crickets and an owl somewhere out in the dark. *That fucking liar*, I thought to myself. *How many times do I have to listen to his bullshit before I learn?* Still, I didn't leave. I continued squinting into the darkness, shivering against the cold, hoping for the best. Five minutes more, I stood, waiting for the strike of midnight. I checked my wristwatch for the last time, the green glowing face showing me that midnight had come and gone and still nothing happened. With a huff, I kicked more dust into the air irritably, and turned away from the crossroads. I lowered my head against the wind and trudged off towards my car, hitting the unlock button on my key fob. The headlights winked at me twice, and then started to flicker. \"The fuck...?\" I said. The headlights cut out altogether at the same moment that the wind immediately died down and an oppressive silence fell over the night as my chest tightened. \"Evening,\" A thick, gravelly voice said from behind me. After a few steadying breaths, I turned toward the voice, not really sure what to expect. I don't quite know what I thought I'd see, but I certainly wasn't ready for a normal looking human. A man stood at the center of the crossroads where I'd buried my offering. He had a long, bony face that made him look rather wizard-like. His black hair was cut short on the sides, the longer strands atop his head were slicked to the side. He wore a black suit with dress shoes. His sleeves were rolled up, his shirt untucked, his tie loose around his neck offering up an air of familiarity and ease. With his hands stuffed in his pockets, he looked rather bored as he stared at me through the darkness of the night. The only thing that made it obvious he wasn't quite human were his blood red eyes that seemed to glow in the dark. *So maybe he didn't lie, after all.* \"Hello,\" I said after sizing him up a bit. \"Hi.\" He looked me up and down once. \"What can I help you with?\" I took a tentative step forward, squinting at him. \"I'm looking for someone.\" \"Someone go missing?\" He flashed a wicked smile. \"We can help with that.\" \"No. Not exactly.\" He cocked his head to the side curiously. His red eyes narrowed at me. \"What is it you need then?\" \"A meeting.\" I took a few more steps forward, stopping with a comfortable distance between us. \"With your boss.\" He arched a brow at me. \"Come again?\" \"I'm asking for a meeting with Lucifer.\" \"You're joking.\" He laughed derisively. \"You came all the way out here, to the middle of nowhere. Killed a rooster. And summoned me, a crossroads demon. To set up a meeting with Lucifer? Ruler of the Demons? Satan himself?\" I nodded, which only made him laugh more. \"You know a better way for a mortal to meet the guy? Without dying and going to hell that is?\" The demon stopped laughing and walked towards me, quickly closing the gap between us. \"You've got a lot of nerve, mortal.\" He stopped moving when were about a foot apart and then looked me up and down again. \"Why do you want to meet him so badly anyway?\" \"He owes me.\" The demon leaned toward me, so close that I could literally smell the brimstone coming off of him. \"*He* owes *you*?\" With a sigh, I reached into my jacket pocket. I procured a small, worn, leather-bound book. The cover was battered, the pages yellowed. My father's initials, EJS, were burned into the spine. The only thing my father left me after he died. I'd spent the last five years with it, trying to find answers to the last entry. \"My father, actually.\" I flipped to the last page and turned the book over to the demon. He took it from me slowly, trying to read my face for as long as possible. He eventually broke eye contact, leaned backwards, and read the entry. Suddenly, those burning red eyes connected with mine again, surprise taking over his features. Then a sorrow crossed his face and he dropped the book to his side. \"You're Emmett's kid. Aren't you?\" he asked with a sigh. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Let me call in a few favors.\" He handed me back the book. \"I'll find you when I have something.\" And with a puff of red-black smoke, he disappeared. The wind picked up again, dispersing the smoke and cutting through my clothing. My car's headlights flickered back on. The sounds of the night returned and I was once again standing alone on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. Only this time I was much closer to the truth.<Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 2 By the time I made it back to the inn, it was closer to morning than last night. I figured I'd be able to sneak into my room and get some shut-eye before having to deal with anyone, but I should've known better. The door had barely clicked shut behind me when a voice called from around the corner, probably from in the kitchens.\"Elena? Is that you?\" I let out a sigh before meandering toward the voice. \"Yeah, it's me.\" The kitchen lights were still pretty faint, which meant they were only just turned on. Half-shrouded in darkness, slumped in one of the chairs, was my mother. She was a small, little thing that seemed to grow smaller each day. Her hair was well past gray and falling far into white; the jump was made quickly after my father passed. She was in her night gown, obviously ready for bed, but based on how she sat, she likely fell asleep in the kitchens waiting for me to get back. Despite me explicitly telling her to not wait up, and that I would be back much later than she expected. She squinted at me, shielding her face from the steadily growing lights overhead. \"How'd it go?\" She asked. \"Pretty good, I think.\" I claimed the chair in front of her, removing my jacket in the process. I took the book out and held it in both hands as I sat. \"Marty was right at least. So that's something.\" \"Was he? Imagine that.\" She stretched in her chair, letting out a massive yawn. \"So did you set up a meeting?\" \"No. Not just yet.\" My mother arched a brow at me, no words needed to get me to explain further. \"The crossroads demon is going to 'call in a few favors' and get back to me.\" \"Well, that's something. More than we've had this whole time.\" I shrugged. \"Yeah...\" She tilted her head at me, reading me in only the way a mother could. \"Why aren't you happy about this?\" \"I don't know.\" I looked off to the side and scratched the back of my head. \"I guess I just didn't realize how entrenched he was in all of this. The demon at the crossroads... he knew exactly who dad was. There was no question about the debt he was owed, or why *I* would come calling, or if it even applied to me. Which we still don't know that it does.\" My mother lifted her hand as her own little way of showing me that she was about to correct me. \"Your father was very explicit in his will. You get the book--\" She tapped the old book in my hands carefully \"--and full legal rights to anything within.\" \"Which is all well and good as far as humans are concerned, but we're talking about demons, mom. The fucking devil.\" \"Language,\" she said sternly. \"Sorry.\" I cowered slightly, showing my hands as way of apology. \"I just have a hard time believing that human law could have any bearing on a contract with Lucifer.\" My eyes dropped to the book in my hands. I was nervously thumbing at the last page where his last entry lie in waiting. \"And why didn't he call on Lucifer for this debt anyway? He could've gotten anything he wanted. He could've fixed the inn after the hurricane. Or saved Max when he got sick. Or cured cancer. Or... you know... not died.\" I heard my mother sighing. She placed a thin hand against my shoulder, forcing me to look up at her. \"Your father was a complicated man.\" She was choosing her words very carefully. Obviously trying not to freak me out anymore than I already was. \"I'm sure he had his reasons.\" \"Wish he'd have told us them before he went and got himself killed.\" The words had left my mouth before I could even think to backtrack on them. I expected my mother to get mad at me. Yell at me. Tell me I was being unfair. Tell me I was being selfish. Maybe even slap me. But instead, she grabbed me by my shoulders and pulled me toward her. She wrapped her thin, wiry arms around me, shielding me from the world, and keeping me where she felt I was most safe. \"So do I, Elena.\" She stroked my hair, as I felt her tears fall against my shoulder. \"So do I.\" She continued stroking my hair until I sagged into her embrace, overtired and in desperate need of something to eat. \"We'll find out the truth soon enough.\"<Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 3 \"I don't know what you were expecting, Elena. Hell is a bureaucratic nightmare. It was designed that way,\" Marty said matter-of-factly from across the table. He couldn't get here fast enough once he heard me tell him that he was right and has since camped out in the inn waiting for the demon's answer just as impatiently as I was. My mother left us to our own devices, mainly. She was just as anxious as we were, but she rathered spending her time keeping herself busy. Cleaning. Cooking. Baking. The like. The past few nights were spent much like this. After all the residents had fled to their rooms and my mother went off to keep her hands busy, Marty and I would sit here in the dining hall. Me, reading. Him, drinking. Both of us worrying over what was to come. \"You've never been to hell.\u201d I rolled my eyes at him. \u201cHow would you know what it's like?\" \"It's hell, Elena. Why wouldn't it be a bureaucratic nightmare?\" He took a hearty swig of his beer with a smug grin. \"'Sides, it's only been three days.\" \"Three days I've had to spend with you wearing that fucking 'I told you so' face the whole damn time.\" \"Well, I did.\" I shook my head at him and had to cross my arms in order to fight the urge to smack him. \"You're lucky you were right this time. Your last four tips sent me on wild goose chases all over the country.\" I lifted my thumb and forefinger in front of his face. \"I was this close to hunting you down and castrating you.\" His face paled as his hand reflexively went to his groin. \"That's a bit excessive, don't you think?\" \"You swore on your children's lives. You don't have kids yet, so I figured--\" \"It's an expression!\" \"Sure.\" Tired of his conversation, I procured my father's book from my bag on the ground and started thumbing through the pages again. I'd read through it thousands of times. His words were basically seared into my brain at this point. But only his words. The more I read it, the harder it was to hear his voice in them. Now, I only heard my own. \"Did that crossroads demon give you *any* clue when he'd get back to you?\" Marty asked. \"Nope.\" \"That book tell you anything about him?\" I snapped the book shut to glower at Marty. \"I've told you a thousand times already. The only mention of anything supernatural in here is the last entry.\" I tapped the leather cover for emphasis. Not that he'd ever read it. I never let anyone else read it. \"And that was only about Lucifer. No one else.\" \"And you're definitely not missing anything in there?\" Marty stared at the book in my hands, hope clear on his visage. \"No.\" I turned away from him again, returning to where I'd left off. \"I've read this... I don't even know how many times. Way more than we've had this conversation.\" \"I'm just saying, maybe if you got some fresh eyes on it, you could--\" \"No, Marty.\" \"But maybe you did miss--\" \"Can you just drop it, Marty?\" \"But isn't it possible that--?\" Before I got the chance to cut him off again, a cloud of red-black smoke exploded onto the scene right next to Marty. The *whooshing* sound that accompanied it was enough to startle us both. When the demon from the crossroads appeared, however, Marty nearly fell out of his chair and let out the highest pitched screech I'd ever heard a grown adult make. \"Jesus tap dancing christ!\" He exclaimed, clutching his chest like the elderly woman he really was. The demon turned his red eyes to Marty with disgust. \"That's a bit insulting, don't you think, Martin?\" Marty stared wide-eyed. His entire body shook as he cowered from the demon. \"He knows my name, Elena. He knows my name.\" His voice was barely a whisper. \"Yeah, I noticed,\" I hissed at Marty. \"Lucifer will meet with you, Elena Scott,\" the demon said to me in a much more formal manner than expected. \"Great.\" I closed the book again. \"When?\" \"Now.\" I blinked. \"Now?\" \"Now?\" Marty parroted. The demon gave Marty a disdainful look before nodding at me. \"Now.\" He extended a hand out to me, as if asking me to dance at a ball, and arched a tentative brow at me. \"May I?\" \"Uh...\" I glanced to Marty who was, of course, no help at all. He couldn't tear his eyes away from the demon who had materialized next to him in a puff of smoke and smelt faintly of brimstone. \"Sure...\" I took his hand, which felt as human as it looked. I'm not sure why that was as surprising to me as it was, but it was. He pulled me to my feet and I gave Marty one last glance. \"Watch after my mom, Marty,\" I said. \"Okay?\" He nodded, still unable to look away from the demon who held my hand carefully in his. \"Yeah, okay.\" The scent of brimstone filled my nostrils, but it wasn\u2019t overbearing. Smoke clouded my vision, but it didn't hurt my eyes. It filled my lungs and permeated my skin, but I didn't feel the urge to cough. A sudden heat took over my entire body, but it didn't feel dangerous or uncomfortable. And then I was somewhere else entirely. Far and away from the inn. But not to hell. At least, not the hell I had imagined. If that's what this was supposed to be. The room wasn\u2019t made of red stone, filled with the most gruesome demons you could imagine, torture implements everywhere, blood flowing from fountains made of bones, and screams in the distance. This was a normal room that you\u2019d probably find in someone\u2019s house. Set up a lot like a dining room. But not one of those \u2018this room is off limits except for parties\u2019 dining rooms. More like an everyday dining room where you\u2019d sit and do homework or partake in a rousing game of \u2018Settlers of Catan\u2019. This felt far too\u2026 comfortable to be hell. Aside from the demon I\u2019d come with and myself, there was only one person in the room. A man sat at the head of the table with his hands folded in front of him. He wore a simple black suit and dress shirt. His blond hair was tousled with disinterest, or at least it was meant to look that way. His half-lidded eyes were golden and seemed to stare straight through to my soul. \u201cElena,\u201d he said finally. His voice was smoother than I expected. \u201cI understand you want to talk.\u201d<Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 4 \"Please have a seat,\u201d he said it like this were a job interview. It took me a few moments of staring to realize I couldn\u2019t just stand there gawking at him. I gathered my courage and claimed the chair opposite Lucifer. \"Thank you, Malthus. That'll be all for now,\" Lucifer said to the demon standing behind me. Without a word, Malthus left. Leaving me alone with the devil. \"What would you like to discuss?\" Lucifer asked calmly. I realized how incredibly lucky I was to still be holding my father's book. Had I not been when Malthus arrived, this would be a lot harder. I flipped the old book to the last page, the last entry, which spoke of what Lucifer owed my father. I slid the book across the table to the devil. \"I want to talk about this.\" He took the book and read my father's words carefully. His eyes narrowed and his lips pursed into a thin line. \"So you're here to collect Emmett's debt? Pity.\" \"Not exactly.\u201d Lucifer\u2019s eyes lifted to mine, a playful smirk on his face. \"Oh?\" \"I want to know what my father did to earn this favor. Why he never tried to cash in on it. Why he left it to me.\" \"Is that all?\" He chuckled. \"No.\" His laughter fell away. \"Don't know why I'm surprised at that. Knowing your father.\" \"I want to know how he died. How he *really* died.\" Lucifer's face hardened. \"That... is something I can\u2019t help you with.\" \"You mean to tell me the devil himself isn't powerful enough to tell me how someone died?\" He laughed, wagging a finger at me. \"I know what you're doing, Elena. Trying to trick me into telling you by challenging me. I should warn you, it's not going to work.\" \"So... you don't know how he died?\" \"Of course, I know. But there are rules. I can't tell you.\" \"But you know who can?\" \"Naturally.\" \"Who is it?\" He laughed again. \"We'll get to that. Maybe. First, let's answer the questions that I'm allowed to. And before you ask, no this won't cost you anything. No it won't count as your one favor. I owe you and your father more than you could know.\" I leaned back in the chair, eyeing him quizzically. \"Okay\u2026?\" \"Let's start off with the easy-to-digest one. Emmett left you the book because he loved you and felt you'd be able to use them all wisely. And you have. Using the majority of the money to help your mom, pay off your debts, and even donate to charity.\" \"Is this your way of saying you're stalking me?\" I asked. \"Your father meant a lot to me, Elena.\" His smirk disappeared, and a contented sadness fell over him. \"I keep tabs on everyone that meant a lot to him.\" \"I'm sorry... I didn't--\" \"Nonsense,\" he waved off the apology. \"You knew none of this. There's no need to apologize.\" He stretched his back a bit, a playful manner returning to his features. \"As for why he never tried to collect this particular debt, I'm not sure. I guess it's because he wanted to save it for you.\" \"But why?\" I pressed. \"I don't have all the answers. Sorry to disappoint... Shall we continue?\u201d I nodded with a sigh. \"Yes, please.\" \"As for the... complicated answer. Your father is not the man you thought he was. He... uh... well, he wasn't entirely human.\" I balked, \"I'm sorry. What?\" \"He was human. For a time. But he wasn't always.\" I blinked at him a few times. \"Wait... so what was he a demon? Or an angel?\" \"He was an angel. Of sorts. A psychopomp, really.\" My eyes widened. \"He was an angel of death?\" \"Up until about... thirty years ago. When he met your mother. On the job.\" He said those last three words slow enough that I understood his meaning. \"My mom was supposed to die thirty years ago?\" He nodded. \"That was the second deal we ever made. Sparing Carissa's life. It was an easy trade. If she was to be spared, he needed to bring me two souls of equal value. He did. And in doing so, pissed off the big guy upstairs. Lost his halo, abandoned his wings, and settled down with your mom.\" I ran a ragged hand through my hair, staring across the table at my father's book. Was this even possible? Would the devil lie about this? How would that possibly benefit him? Did my mother know? Why wouldn\u2019t she tell me if she did? \"The first deal we made was... a few millennia ago. I owed Emmett for saving my life. From our father.\" He said it like he didn't care. But there was a flash of sadness and anger in his eyes that told otherwise. \"He convinced our father to spare me. Take away my halo, send me to Earth. Give me another task. And that's how I ended up here.\" He gestured around himself. \u201cIn hell.\u201d I rubbed my temple. \"So... what does that make me?\" \"For all intents and purposes, you're human. You\u2019re still mortal. But you're not entirely mortal, either. You're part angel.\" \"Fuck...\" \"You said it.\" He closed my father's book and slid it back across the table to me. I snatched it off the wooden surface absentmindedly. \"As much as I would love to stay here and chat, I\u2019ve a job to do.\" Lucifer stood, buttoning up his suit. \"And you've got someone else to visit.\" He snapped his fingers, followed not even a second later by Malthus's return. \"Malthus will give you the details. When you find her, make sure to not mention me. It definitely won't help.\" \"Wait! Is she going to tell me how my dad died?\" The tail end of my question was cut off by Malthus's red-black smoke. Once again, I was far and away from where I started. Somehow with more questions than I started with.<Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 5 After everything that Lucifer told me, the least surprising thing to happen today should've been when Malthus poofed me back to the inn. But when we rematerialized in the now vacant dining hall, I couldn't keep my surprise to myself. \"What are we doing back here?\" I asked, looking about the dining hall for some sort of answer. \"I thought we were going to see... whoever we were going to see.\" \"We will. Just not yet,\" Malthus explained. I crossed my arms. \"You have to call in a few more favors to set up this meeting, don't you?\" He nodded. \"I do.\" \"Fine. I guess I'll be here,\" I groaned. \"I'll be back shortly. Get some rest, will you?\" I scoffed. \"Right.\" A puff of smoke later and Malthus was gone. The scent of brimstone lingered long after he left. Too long for it to have just been him. I sniffed my shirt and realized too late that it wasn\u2019t just him. With a groan, I stood from the table, grabbed my father's book, and made my way farther into the inn. I found my room in the near darkness. I peeled my shirt off and threw it and the book down on the mattress. My hands were already working my pants off when my mind registered the \"oof\" that came from the bed. I reached the light switch faster than the bed's occupant seemed to be able to wake. I had grabbed the closest weapon I could think of, a hefty desk lamp, and hoisted it over my head ready for a fight. The lump under the covers, rolled over slowly. \"Elena, is that you?\" \"Mom?\" I nearly dropped the lamp trying to put it back. I crossed the distance to the bed as she pulled the blanket off of her head. I snatched my shirt off of the covers pulling it over my head again. \"What are you doing in here?\" \"Well, I *was* sleeping.\" I rubbed my forehead. \"I meant why aren't you sleeping in your room?\" \"Marty said you left with some demon. We didn't know when you'd be back.\" I sighed. She did this when dad died, too. Spent every waking moment in his office, work shed, or their room for months. She wanted to remember as much of him as possible. The first thing she forgot was his scent. Even their room lost it, eventually. That's about the time she bought the inn. \"I'm back now, mom.\" I took her hands in mine, offering a meager smile. \"I haven't been gone that long.\" \"No, you haven't. But you can never be too sure.\" She smacked her lips a few times, rubbed her eyes, and yawned out, \"How was hell?\" \"Different.\" \"Different how?\" \"Well, there was a lot less blood than I expected.\" \"You say that a lot more often than I'd like,\" she said with a scowl. \"What did Lucifer tell you?\" My first instinct was to tell her everything. She and I had become a team ever since dad died. We kept no secrets. Only... that may not be true. Either mom knew what dad was and she didn't tell me, or she had no idea and telling her could end poorly. I needed more information before I told her anything. \"Not enough,\" I said. \"I'm gonna meet someone else to get more answers.\" \"Soon, I hope?\" \"They didn't say.\" She tutted to herself. \"Of course not.\" I bit the inside of my mouth nervously. \"Hey, mom. How *did* you meet dad?\" She turned to me with a look of confusion. \"You told me he saved your life, but you never really told me how.\" She frowned slightly. \"I'm not particularly fond of that time of my life, Elena. Even if it is what brought your father to me.\" \"I'm 27, mom. I think I can handle it.\" She fought the urge to smile as she mulled it over. \"Alright, fine. I suppose you're right.\" She took a deep breath and placed her hands gingerly in mine. \"Before I met your father, I wasn't in a good place. I was an addict. Cocaine is a sweet mistress, let me tell you. I'd do anything to get some. And I mean *anything*.\" \"Yeah, I don't need details about that,\" I said as my body caved inward on itself. \"At my lowest point, I got in a pretty bad car accident after overdosing. Wrapped my car around a telephone pole. Thankfully, I didn't hit anyone. That would've... just destroyed me.\" Her eyes had a far off look as she recounted what happened. \"Your father was the first one on the scene. He was just driving by, happened to see the crash. He got me out of the vehicle, which was on fire, and managed to flag down a passing driver. He told the guy to get to the nearest landline and call 9-1-1. He took the ride with me to the hospital. He was the first person I saw when I woke.\" She chuckled at the memory. \"And the first person I tried to attack when I figured out where I was.\" \"You attacked him?\" \"Not well. The doctors were surprised I could even do that. Said it was a miracle I was alive, let alone trying to fight people. I'm certain I'd be dead if your father hadn't been driving by that night.\" *She doesn't know*. \"You're probably right.\" I forced a yawn, stretching in an over-exaggerated manner. \"Think I'm gonna take a shower. Are you gonna be here when I get out?\" She gathered herself up and hopped off the bed. \"No, I think, I'll go back to my room.\" She waddled around the bed, touched my arm affectionately, and kissed me on the forehead. \"Good night, love.\" \"Night, mom.\" I watched her go with a steadily growing pit in my stomach. *How doesn't she know?*<Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 6 \"Well, I mean, I recently found out my dad was a drag queen in the eighties, so it's kind of the same thing, you know?\" I glowered at Marty mid-throw, the look more than enough to quell his feeble attempts at sympathy. \"Okay, but seriously, why didn't you tell your mom? Finding out your late husband was a literal angel can't be the worst thing in the world. Pretty sure she'll take it better than my mom took finding out my dad was a drag queen.\" I threw the knife across the yard, burying it hilt-deep into the wooden target that Marty had propped up against the fence. The wood splintered slightly upon impact. \"He wasn't *just* an angel, Marty.\" I crossed the yard to retrieve the knife, yanking it out of the thick wood in one fell swoop. \"He was an angel of death. A psychopomp.\" I walked back across the yard to return the throwing knife to Marty. \"His job was ushering the dead to their rightful resting place. And he fucked that up.\" \"For her,\" Marty pointed out. \"Yeah, but why?\" I threw myself down to the ground with a huff. Marty knelt beside me, waiting for the right moment to speak next. \"If I tell her what happened, why she's really alive today, what it cost... it'd break her. And to think the man she loved for 25 years was capable of making such a choice for someone he'd just met...\" I began tearing some blades of grass out of the ground. \"I need to find out why. What made him make that sort of deal. What about her was so special. Because I can't imagine him making that sort of decision on a whim. I can't let my mom think that, either.\" Marty twirled the knife around in his hand, staring at the blade as it turned over and over. \"You know you're not going to get that answer from anyone but your dad. And he's gone.\" I closed my eyes and sighed. \"Yeah. I know.\" \"Come on,\" he said in such an uncharacteristically soothing tone, it forced me to turn almost my entire body to look at him. He had his hand stretched out to me, raising his brow at me expectantly. I took his hand and let him pull me to my feet. \"Up you get.\" Once on my feet, he wiped off my shoulders, swatting away imaginary dust. He threw the knife into the dirt where it stuck straight upwards. \"Let's go make you another target.\" We both looked toward the fractured wood leaning against the fence, held together by splinters. \"You kind of broke the last one.\" Together, we left the yard, heading off towards the work shed my mother had built as a way to remember my father. It went mostly unused, except for when Marty came around. Which was all too infrequent to keep such a well stocked work shed. As we walked along, I nudged his arm. \"Thank you,\" I said when he looked my way. His face scrunched up. \"For?\" \"Not being wrong about the crossroads. Keeping me busy while we wait. Somehow being the voice of reason in all this bullshit.\" \"Someone needs to be a wet blanket for all your weird angelic drama.\" Just as we rounded the corner into the work shed, a puff of red-black smoke appeared in front of us. Marty nearly jumped out of his skin, flailing his arms about like he'd just walked through a spider web. \"Jesus H Christ!\" He shouted. \"Can you fucking not do that?\" Malthus only rolled his eyes in response. \"Good to see you too, Martin.\" He turned his red eyes to me. \"The meeting has been set.\" \"Great. Now? Or do I have some prep time?\" \"She'll be here in a few minutes.\" \"Wait, wait, wait.\" Marty took a step forward, pointing at the ground. \"She's coming *here*?\" \"Well, not to that exact spot. But yes. She's coming to the inn.\" I grabbed Marty roughly by the arm, shaking him just enough to get him to look at me. \"We have to get the residents out of here.\" He nodded, swallowing hard. \"You're right.\" Just as the words left his mouth, an ear-piercing shriek erupted from the inn behind us. I turned towards the sound hoping beyond all hopes that it wasn't our expected visitor. \"It appears you don't have the time for that,\" Malthus said.<Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 7 My feet carried me to the backdoor of the inn before my thoughts could catch up with me. With Marty lagging behind, I tore through the back halls of the inn hoping to find the source of the distressed scream before things got any worse. I pushed my way past several residents, barely offering any form of an apology, before barreling headfirst into the lobby. Instead of panicked and fearful screams, I was met with laughter and more than a few apologies. A large group of people had gathered in the lobby. Considering the time of day, there were a lot of people checking in and checking out right about now, so that wasn't entirely out of the ordinary. Neither was the laughing. The apologizing, though, that was new. \"I didn't think it would follow me in here, I swear,\" a man wearing Nantucket red shorts said. \"Guess that's what I get for trying to feed a squirrel.\" \"It's alright,\" My mother's voice reached me between the throng of people gathered in the lobby. Martin reached my side, breathless and sweaty; he was just as confused as I was by what was going on. A young man barely old enough to vote pushed his way through the crowd, saying \u2018excuse me\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 the whole way, carrying a cardboard box with holes cut in the top, likely for the aforementioned squirrel. \"They're pretty easy to catch when you have the right sort of bait,\u201d my mother said. \"We're terribly sorry, Mrs. Scott,\" a new voice I couldn't pinpoint floated to me as I squeezed my way through the crowd. \"*Someone* ought to know better than to feed wild animals.\" \"It's perfectly fine, dear.\" My mother's voice probably sounded chipper to everyone in the lobby, but I picked up on her irritation underneath it all. Chances were good it wasn't the squirrel that was pissing her off. \"I've dealt with worse.\" I made my way to the front of the crowd, finally close enough to see the two talking with my mother. The man in shorts also wore a ridiculous, blue polo shirt that really made him look like he was trying to hard to appear rich. His brown hair was spiked upwards and a pair of sports sunglasses stood atop the gelled locks. The woman at his left was dressed a bit more modestly, wearing a gray woolen dress that was still slightly too upscale for my mother's inn. Her flowing red hair was pulled back into a simple updo, though it still managing to reach all the way down to her waist. \"I'm sure you have,\" the woman said, her green eyes flashing to mine for the briefest of seconds. \"We'd hate to take up anymore of your time, though. It appears our business partner has just arrived.\" My mother followed the woman's gaze to where I stood, arms crossed, eyes narrowed, at the front of the crowd. \"Well, I'd hate to keep you waiting.\" She returned to her duties, hesitating just long enough to offer me a questioning look, obviously asking if I needed backup for this interaction. I waved off her concern, eyeing the strange woman who had appeared so suddenly in our lobby. With a proper distraction gone, the crowd dissipated, milling about going about whatever business they were attending to. The woman and her cohort made their way to me languidly, almost bored by what was going on around them. \"You... must be Elena,\" The woman said, taking the time between her words to look me up and down more than a few times. \"And you are?\" \"Lilith.\" She extended a hand to me, refusing to break eye contact. \"Pleased to meet you.\" I reluctantly shook her hand, noting an almost electric current passing from her hand to mine. \"Likewise.\" Upon releasing her hand, I looked behind her to the man following her around. His dark, almost black eyes were darting about the lobby, taking everything in. \"And who might that be?\" \"No one important,\" she said calmly. She took a step toward me, lowering her face to mine in order to whisper in my ear. \"Do you have somewhere we can talk that's a bit more... discreet?\" I took a step away from the woman, jerking my head down the hall I'd just come from. \"This way.\" I didn't wait for a response before walking down the hall toward the wine cellar. This woman, Lilith, whoever she was, has already made it clear she's not someone to mess with. She presented herself to the entire inn, something neither Malthus nor Lucifer were willing to do. She knew who I was before I even told her my name. She even knew my mother. Somehow, she seemed far more dangerous than Lucifer. The actual devil. It\u2019s entirely possible that Marty was right when he said this was a road I wouldn\u2019t want to go down. But it's been over three years since I started down this path. It was too late to turn back now.<Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 8 The wine cellar was the closest thing we had to a secluded area at the inn. It was in a hidden alcove off the kitchens and had thick concrete walls that didn't allow much noise to travel through. The door didn't have a lock on the inside, so there was no real way to prevent someone from accidentally walking in our conversation from within. Which is why I tasked Marty with guarding the door. He tried arguing against it, but Lilith pointed out that she wasn't here to talk to him. Just me. And he wasn\u2019t exactly willing to argue with her on that point. So, Lilith, myself, and the still nameless probably-demon went down into the wine cellar. Alone. Part of me hoped Malthus would show up and offer some assistance, but of course he didn't. He'd done enough for me, with nothing in return, mind you. Lilith stalked about the wine cellar examining the room. I watched her closely, wondering what she was looking for. If it was some breach in the already questionable safety of the room or just a good bottle of wine to crack open, I couldn't tell. Not that it seemed to matter. She dragged her fingers across a row of bottles, examined the dust she picked up, and scowled. \"Not quite what I'd had in mind when I asked for a more discreet location.\" She rubbed her fingers together to dispel the dust. \"But I guess beggars can't be choosers.\" She took in a deep breath of air, placed her hands on her hips, and gave me an appraising look. \"So what am I doing here, Elena?\" That was not the question I was expecting. \"I was told you had some information for me. About my father.\" \"So, you're Emmett's kid. I've heard you've been making a lot of noise lately. Gotta say, you're not quite what I'd expected.\" She closed the gap between us. She looked me over once more, a much closer inspection this time. \"Yeah, I can see the family resemblance now. You've got that same holier-than-thou-troublemaker look to you.\" I scrunched my nose up at her. \"Is that supposed to be a compliment?\" \"You're looking for answers about your dad, aren't you?\" She said, completely ignoring my question altogether. I ground my teeth, trying to gloss over that slight. \"Yeah. I was hoping you could tell me how he died.\" She narrowed her eyes at me suspiciously. \"You're joking, right?\" When I didn't answer in the affirmative, she turned to her shadow who had simply been listening and watching this whole time. \"She's joking, right?\" The man offered as much of an answer as I did before Lilith again turned her attention to me. \"Emmett's not dead.\" *This bitch.* \"Yes. He is. I saw his body.\" \"No, you didn't. You saw *a* body. One we designed to look a lot like him, sure. But that wasn't *his* body.\" She pinched the bridge of her nose. \"Who even told you he was dead?\" I crossed my arms and shifted my weight from foot to foot, staring at her with half-lidded eyes. \"The coroner.\" \"Fucking mortals,\" she groaned, dropping her hands to her sides. \"Look, kid, I don't know why you've been left in the dark on this for five fucking years, but your daddy ain't dead. Okay?\" \"What?\" Lilith snapped her fingers, calling the man behind her forward. \"Who was in charge of his case file?\" \"I believe that was Dumah,\" the man answered. \"And he didn't think to tell her?\" \"Evidently not.\" \"Fucking angels!\" She threw her hands in the air irritably and began pacing. \"Alright, open a corridor. We need to settle this. Now.\" \"You got it,\" the man said. With a flourish of his hands, a swirling mass of bright white light appeared behind him, illuminating the entire cellar. It was pretty small, no larger than a dinner plate, floating in space halfway between the floor and the ceiling, but it was steadily growing. Meanwhile, what's-his-face paced around the light making weird hand gestures and muttering under his breath. I took a hesitant step towards the two of them, both seemed to have decided to ignore me entirely. \"I'm sorry, what's going on?\" \"I can't *believe* they would let something like this slide! How un-fucking-professional,\" Lilith said as she paced. \"You wanna tell me what's happening?\" I said louder. Lilith stopped pacing and faced me again, at this point the strange white light was large enough to touch the floor and the ceiling alike. \"You wanted answers, right?\" She asked. My eyes darted between her and the '*corridor*' that her lackey just finished summoning. She pointed toward the swirling white mass, her green eyes not once leaving mine. \"This is how you get them.\" \"We've gotta make this quick, Lilith. The big guy won't be happy if we keep this open for much longer,\" The man said. Lilith extended her hand to me. She inclined her head impatiently. \"Now or never, kid.\"<Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 9 Travel via corridor, was very different than travelling with Malthus. Where his brimstone-esque teleportation was an instantaneous blink of an eye sort of experience, the corridor felt more... involved. Stepping through the white swirling mass of energy, I was immediately blinded by the brightness around me. The world seemed to fall away around me and there was a distinct moment where I felt gravity slipping away. If Lilith hadn't instructed me to keep moving until I could see again, I likely would've stopped right then and there. Probably getting stuck in some weird limbo for all eternity. The light slowly fell away as gravity returned, and my feet felt solid ground again. I stopped walking when I saw Lilith's bright red hair only a foot ahead of me. I blinked a few times, my vision blurred from the brightness within the corridor. \"What is the meaning of this?\" A deep booming voice asked. \"Why did you bring a mortal here?\" \"She's not a mortal,\" Lilith groaned. \"Not completely, at least.\" As my vision returned, I saw who, or rather what, Lilith was talking to. Floating in the empty white space ahead of us was a large white mass made of a material similar to the corridor. Like the corridor, the matter spun around itself shifting the shape and composition constantly. Regardless, it kept the vague, yet distinctive shape of an incredibly androgynous person. At least from the torso up. Whatever was going on below the waist wasn't visible. \"You know the rules, Lilith.\" The voice boomed. \"How'd you even bring her here, anyway?\" The being's head shifted and seemed like it was almost looking at me. \"Of course. Raziel.\" The being's head rolled, almost like it was rolling its eyes. \"You know the rules just as well as she does, boy.\" Raziel, the man who accompanied Lilith to the inn, stepped forward, keeping his hands clasped at his back. \"There are some extenuating circumstances here that... bend the rules, as it were.\" \"Yeah. Uh-huh, like what?\" The more this being spoke, the more I realized that they were just as normal as all the other supernatural beings I'd met thus far. Which is possibly the weirdest sentence I've ever used to describe these people. \"Her father is Samael,\" Raziel said. I whipped my head at him quizzically. I knew more than enough about religion to understand who Samael was. I never put it together that that was my dad\u2019s real name. Or that Emmett wasn\u2019t his real name. Raziel\u2019s dark eyes never faltered from the being floating before us, refusing to connect with mine and answer my unspoken question. Not that I needed him to. \"Samael sired a child?\" The being asked, its voice no longer booming. It sounded just as normal as the rest of ours. I stole a glance at it, and for the first time saw a defined face. A very feminine face, with two glowing white eyes staring straight at me. \"Does father know?\" Its voice was very feminine as well. \"He does.\" The being tsked. \"No one tells me anything.\" \"We need a meeting with Dumah. Or Emmett - sorry - Samael,\" Lilith said. She looked over her shoulder at me, those green eyes refusing to betray whatever she was thinking. \"She deserves answers.\" The being continued staring at me, its vague form falling away even farther to reveal a very normal, very young looking woman. Her features were still almost entirely white, but she finally had a face I could recognize now. \"Fine. Get her inside before I change my mind,\" she said with a wave of her hand. A doorway appeared beside her and slowly began to open. She held her hand out, palm upwards, until a bright white energy sparked over it. When the light fell away, it left behind a white cloak hovering just over her hand. \"And keep her hidden.\" She flung the cloak at me, no words needed to instruct me to put it on. And keep it on. \"Don't think I don't know what you're doing wasn't officially approved.\" Raziel placed a firm hand at my back and pushed me towards the newly opened doorway. \"Thank you, Uriel.\" \"Mmhmm,\" she barely glanced at the three of us as we passed through the doorway. \u201cI\u2019ll send one of them your way soon enough. Just keep. Her. Hidden.\u201d<Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 10 I'm still not sure if it was heaven I walked into when Uriel opened that doorway. It was as bland and mundane as where I'd met Lucifer. Which I still haven't had clarification as to whether or not that was hell, either. Wherever I was, there were a *lot* of people. And I couldn't tell you if they were angels, demons, or something completely different that I didn't yet know existed. I guessed angels. There were people that looked like they were made of pure light. People that were made of pure darkness. Eyes, skin, hair, and fingernails of every color. And I mean every color. Some people didn't even look like they were people. We passed three minotaur looking creatures. I never got the chance to linger anywhere, ask questions, or get a good look at anyone. Lilith simply pushed onward, leading us through this strange place while Raziel took up the rear. After a time, I realized that Lilith wasn't making any attempts to find somewhere to hide. She was making a beeline for what looked like the largest building in the place. I glanced over my shoulder to Raziel, who only told me to keep my hood up and my head down. \"You're not trying to keep me hidden... are you?\" I called to Lilith. \"Right now we are, so can you shut up?\" She shot me an aggressive look over her shoulder. \"What are you planning?\" \"You'll see soon enough, child,\" Raziel said. We wound our way through the throngs of people and around various buildings, always aiming for the heart of whatever this place was. It was hard to tell how much time had passed since my wrist watch stopped working the moment we passed through the corridor. And with no sun or any discernible passage of time, I was beginning to wonder how long I would be away from my mom for this time. If she was already in my room, drinking in what was left of my scent. If she'd end up selling the inn, too, if I didn't make it back soon enough. Eventually, we arrived at the center of this place. A large coliseum-inspired palace, surrounded by a moat of nothingness. Leaning over the edge, I saw a sheer drop that seemed to go on forever into an infinite nothingness. Lilith had to drag me away from it, hissing at me about how stupid I was to get that close. \"You dumb, dumb girl,\" she grumbled. She dragged me to the only bridge on this side of the palace, putting the three of us back in order. Her in the lead, me following close behind, and Raziel bringing up the rear. For whatever reason, we were the only ones crossing the bridge to enter the palace. I knew better than to ask Lilith why. At least for now. We continued on our forward trajectory into the palace. Lilith lead us down endless corridors, hushing me every time I thought I could finally ask her a question, until we came before a pair of ornate golden doors. Carved into the surface was an sculpture of epic proportions depicting legions of angels and demons going to war, but not against each other. Two separate armies, each comprised of both angels and demons, fought each other. Only differentiated by the shapes of the helms they wore. Lilith stood before the doorway for a moment, staring up at the image with the same expression of awe I likely wore on my face, hers a bit more muted. \"Stay with Raziel until he tells you to. Okay, kid?\" She didn't look at me when she said it. She didn't wait for an answer, either. She just pressed forward, thrusting the large doors open with a seemingly unnecessary dramatic flair. The sound of raucous discussion erupted from within the room when the doors were opened, but with the way the door opened and Lilith's subsequent entrance, that discussion quickly died away. \"Well, don't stop on my account,\" Lilith said as she strode into the room. Raziel gripped my shoulder, and snuck me into the room while everyone was distracted. We slipped into the crowd, easily blending in with the throng. \"Lilith,\" an angry probably-angel said. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Well, I was hoping to have an audience with the big guy. I guess you lot can do.\" \"What could you possibly have to tell him?\" another angel asked. \"It appears that one of you made a mistake with one of our more recent acquisitions,\" Lilith answered, examining her fingernails with disinterest. \"What acquisition?\" An angel stepped forward. He wore exactly what you'd expect a stereotypical angel to be wearing. A nice, white toga clasped at the shoulder with a golden brooch. \"Interesting you should ask, Dumah. Because you might be familiar with this little predicament.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Raziel leaned toward me and whispered in my ear, \"Now, Elena.\" Without any further warning, he pushed me forward between the only two angels standing before me while simultaneously removing the cloak from my shoulders. I stumbled out to the center of the room. I swear, I'd never heard a room gasp so dramatically and so collectively in my entire life. \"What is this, Lilith?\" Dumah asked, unable to look away from me. The rest of the room couldn't seem stop staring, either. \"Your fuck up, Dumah.\" There was a shuffling among the crowd, as several people pushed their way to the front or the back. Hushed murmuring fell across the crowd as they continued staring at me. \"Elena?\" I heard an all-too familiar voice say. I turned toward the voice and immediately felt a ball forming in my throat. Standing apart from the other angels, wearing a simple black suit and a much more youthful face than I ever saw in my life, was none other than my father. Emmett Joseph Scott. Samael. The psychopomp. \"Dad...\" <Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 11 The other angels were livid. Much like Uriel, they had no idea I existed. Shouting erupted immediately, blaming everyone for something else. Dumah was blamed for messing up in some way shape or form. My father was blamed for sparing Lucifer, for abandoning his family, for starting a new one, and for abandoning that one in turn. Lilith was basically physically attacked by two very angry looking female angels. And every other grievance they had with each other was suddenly being aired. All of a sudden, Lilith, Dumah, my father, and I were swept away to another section of the palace by a group of angels all wearing the same generic, white toga as Dumah. Lilith and Dumah were shouting at each other basically the whole way. We four were sealed off in another room and told to wait. Lilith and Dumah didn't much care for our new location as their shouting match continued. At this point, they weren't even arguing about what Lilith did today, calling on old hurts and past mistakes they both committed. \"Don't give me that. You wanted him gone just as much as I did,\" Lilith scoffed. \"He was a fucking child, Lilith!\" \"He was a little menace who'd have killed us all if we let him, and you know it!\" Doing my best to ignore these two 'superior beings' I paced along a wall thinking of anything and everything other than the laundry lists of reprehensible acts they were blaming each other for. \"Elena...\" My father's voice cut into my aimless train of thought that had recently just settled on thinking of all the dogs I'd had throughout my life. \"We ought to talk before he gets here.\" I shot him an impetuous glance. \"What about?\" I kept on pacing, not really wanting to have to look him directly in the eye. \"How you've been alive this whole time? How you let me and mom and think you were dead for five fucking years? And for what? For this?\" I gestured to him. \"Getting to look young forever again?\" \"That's not what happened. It's more complicated than that. If you'd just let me explain--\" \"Save it. I don't want to hear it.\" \"Elena, listen.\" He grabbed my hand as I walked past him for the umpteenth time. \"I did this *for* you.\" I rounded on him quickly, snaking my hand out of his grasp. \"How the fuck has this been for me? You go and die. Giving your entire estate to the government, refusing to help out me or mom for that matter. Leaving me only a cryptic book--\" I stuffed my hand in my pocket to pull out the battered, leather-bound book. \"--just full of a bunch of debts owed to you from a bunch of people I've never met. You have any idea how hard it was to collect on some of these? I went to Antarctica for one of them, dad. *Antarctica*!\" I threw the book at him angrily, it bounced squarely off his chest. He bobbled it around before catching it again. \"Left mom alone for a month and a half to chase him down. You know what we got, huh? Guess. Go on. Guess.\" \"Elena--\" \"A wooden duck. A wooden. Fucking. Duck! Carved out of a very common oak tree. Not even an important oak. Or a cool type of oak. Just oak. I left home for a month and a half to get a wooden duck, hoping to get some answers about that stupid fucking book. But nothing. Absolutely nothing. You '*died*' and didn't even seem to care about what that did for me or mom. And now you're claiming you did this *for* us? No. Fuck that. You did this for you and no one else.\" \"If you would just listen--\" \"I told you. I don't want to hear it, okay?\" I shook my head as I stalked away from him again. \"God, I knew this was a mistake.\" \"You rang?\" A very new, very unfamiliar voice said from far too close for comfort. I jumped a whole five feet away from the person who had poofed into existence at my side. Unlike when Malthus did that, there was no noise, smoke, or scent to accompany the sudden appearance. This person just appeared out of thin air. The man before me was the oldest person I'd seen in this entire place. Not just in physicality, but I could almost feel the age on him. Like there was a weight to him. He wore a stereotypically all white suit. His hair was still gray despite how old he obviously was. His nearly black eyes were just as lively as anyone else's. No one needed to tell me who this was. He was God. Or at least, the person we would call God. He was the father of all the angels. Making him my grandfather. \"About time,\" Lilith said. \"There's a matter that needs settling.\" \"I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it has something to do with Elena,\" He answered. \"Yeah. Her and Samael.\" The man turned to me and my father, who stood slightly behind me. With his eyes on me now, I saw that they weren't black, but actually appeared to hold galaxies within them. If I weren't so pissed off, I'd probably find them beyond interesting. \"Yes, I was wondering when this would happen.\" His eyes lingered for only a second before he turned to Lilith and Dumah. \"Dumah, fetch the case file, will you?\" \"Yes, sir,\" Dumah said. He glared at Lilith before stalking out of the room. \"Now, it appears some explanation is needed.\"<Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 12 \"Since you've made it this far, I think it's safe to assume you've figured out what your father is. Who he was, before your mother. And how he fits into all of this.\" He gestured at everything around us, never once breaking eye contact with me. I nodded, even though parts of his past were still a complete mystery to me. \"I'm going to hazard a guess that the reason you're here is to find out what actually happened five years ago when he '*died*'. Is that correct?\" I nodded again. \"Yes.\" \"The first thing you should know is what you are, in truth. I'm sure you have an idea, but you may have come to the wrong conclusion. While your mother was mortal, and so was Samael when he sired you, you're not. You're not even part mortal. You're all angel.\" My eyes flashed to Lilith, who was just as surprised at that revelation as I was. She only offered a meager shrug in response to my questioning glance. \"And since Samael's your father, you're a prime candidate to be a psychopomp. Considering you spent your life growing up among the mortals, you would probably be the best psychopomp we'd ever had. The plan, since you were born, was to induct you into our ranks once you were old enough. Once you turned eighteen, you would be inducted.\" \"Acquired, you mean?\" I said, remembering the word Lilith used earlier. \"That's one word for it.\" Emotion didn't break his calm resolve. He only nodded. \"But, Samael made a case for you staying on earth long enough to finish your education. Go to college. Get a degree. Learn to be a true citizen of Earth before induction. We agreed and the date was reset for your graduation.\" I remembered the lead up to my graduation. My father seemed nervous, but no more than he did when I went away to college. At the time, I thought it was just empty nest syndrome. Not so much anymore. \"Three years of school and a gap year later, you finally graduated. And the topic was revisited. Suddenly a new proposition was offered. Samael offered himself up as a psychopomp in your stead. It was agreed that you would stay behind to care for your mother until she passed. Only then would the topic be revisited.\" I looked at my father. He averted my gaze with an overly guilty expression painted across his face. \"That should've been my choice.\" \"It was,\" Raziel's voice cut into the room. I turned to his voice and saw both him and Dumah returning, carrying with them a simple manilla folder. The mundaneness of it clashed very strongly with my understanding of this place. \"The fuck are you talking about, Raz?\" Lilith asked. \"What do you know about this?\" \"I'm the Keeper of Secrets, Lilith. I know everything,\" he said as he crossed the room to me. He handed me the folder, which I accepted hesitantly, offering him only an apprehensive look. \"You'll want to read this.\" I glanced to my father, who still avoided my gaze, then Lilith, who was staring at the file with a rapacious appetite. A final glance to Raziel convinced me to open the manilla folder. The only thing within was a single-paged agreement with only a few words on it and five signatures. The big guy over there, who of course signed with the name 'Father'. My father, who signed as Emmett. Dumah. Raziel. And myself. The document itself didn't quite explain what we were agreeing to in words, but somehow I was able to discern from the page what exactly was agreed upon. \"You... wiped my memory...\" I said staring at the page. \"We did,\" Raziel confirmed. \"And I agreed to this?\" I looked towards my father, anger slipping from my grasp. He nodded, finally looking me in the eye since I yelled at him. \"It was the only way you could stay with your mother. If you thought my death was real, too. We knew your mother could handle me dying much better than you dying,\" my father explained. \"Wiping your memory was the only way.\" I shifted my weight from foot to foot irritably. \"What... what happens now?\" I looked between all those in attendance hoping for some explanation. \"I know all of this now... and mom knows parts of it... Do you send me home to finish out the contract? Can I even go back?\" \"You can. But your memories of this event stay here,\" Raziel explained. \"But we'll just end up back here anyway. I'll still have the book by rights, with the last entry about Lucifer. I'll just dive down this rabbit hole all over again. We'll just keep repeating the cycle until mom dies... won't we?\" \"Not necessarily,\" my father stepped forward, holding his book out to me. All eyes turned to him curiously. Only Father seemed to know what was happening. \"Lucifer still owes you a favor.\" I stared at the small, leatherbound book wondering what I could possibly ask him for that could avoid this infinite search for answers. And then it hit me. I took the book from my father's hand, who smiled at me apologetically. Turning to Father, I asked, \"Can I cash in on this favor before you wipe my memory?\" \"Of course.\" He nodded. \"Raziel will take you to Lucifer. He'll be the one to take your memories as well.\" Father offered a sincere smile while Raziel summoned another corridor for us to pass through. \"Good luck, Elena.\"<Cosmic_Flyer>: Part 13 (The Last Part) Lucifer was not in the same dining-room-esque place where I'd met him originally. Instead, we found him in a massive office sitting behind a rather large desk, filling out paperwork. When the corridor opened and I stepped through, he looked up at me, a broad smile across his face. \"Elena. How kind of you to visit me unannounced like this,\" He said. His eyes flashed behind me to Raziel as he stepped through the corridor. \"I see you've had your meeting with Lilith, then.\" I approached his desk and threw down my father's book, open to the last page. \"I'm here for that favor.\" \"Down to business already, I see.\" He stood with a sigh. \"Guess I shouldn't be surprised. You are Emmett's daughter.\" He buttoned his jacket calmly. \"What is it you want?\" \"For you to strike this debt from my father's book.\" He blinked at me. \"Seriously?\" His eyes flashed to Raziel before returning to mine. \"You can ask for anything in the cosmos. I can give your mother eternal life. Or eternal happiness. I can give you all the answers Raziel here will never share. And you want... this?\" \"Yes.\" I nodded. \"*And* I need you to alter my mother's and Marty's memories.\" He laughed. \"You only get one favor, Elena. I can't do all of that.\" \"You said it yourself that you owe my father and I more than I could know.\" He scowled at me. \"You really *are* Emmett's daughter, aren't you?\" He threw his hands in the air. \"Alright fine. You got it. What do you want altered?\" \"I need them to think I already found out everything there is to know about my dad. Make something up about him being a mortal that made a deal with you before he met my mom. A deal that was settled *before* he died.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Can I ask why?\" \"No.\" He shrugged. \"Alright. As you wish.\" And with a snap of his fingers, the words in the back of my father's book were crossed off. The deal still obvious, but settled. \"I sure hope you know what you're doing.\" \"I do.\" ***2 years*** ***later...*** Marty stood next to me, refusing to leave my side, as the last few mourners finally departed the cemetery. He'd stuck by my side since she got sick six months ago. None of my father's debts having enough money or clout to help her. His stupid book proving worthless once again. \"Elena,\" he whispered, attempting to drag my attention away from her tombstone. \"Someone's coming over.\" I most definitely didn't want to deal with someone else offering their condolences. I knew they were trying to make me feel better. But all it did was make them feel better. And I honestly couldn't give a shit about how they felt. But I wouldn't ignore anyone. Not here. Standing in front of my mother's grave. A man I'd never seen before approached Marty and I. I didn't remember seeing him at any of the services, but to be fair I didn't remember seeing anyone at any of the services. His brown hair was cut close to his head in almost militaristic style. He stared at me with dark, almost black eyes. He wore a lavish suit under a black trench coat, obviously someone who came from money. A part of me wondered where he was while she was sick with all that money. Another, louder part of me yelled at me for being so selfish. \"I'm terribly sorry for your loss, Miss Scott,\" He said once he was within earshot and extended a hand to me. \"Thank you.\" I shook his hand, eyeing him carefully. \"How did you know my mother?\" \"I didn't know her very well, in truth. I'm a friend of your father's actually,\" he said. \"My name's Raziel, though I doubt he ever told you about me.\" I arched a brow at him, and not just because of that ridiculous name. \"I don't remember seeing you at his funeral.\" \"I unfortunately never made it to his funeral. A grievance I hope we can get past.\" I shrugged. \"Sure. Yeah.\" The man glanced to Marty. \"Do you mind if we speak in private, Miss Scott?\" I looked to Marty, whose anger was rising steadily at this complete stranger. \"Why?\" \"I think it's about time I told you one of your father's secrets.\"<pup6446>: Cliff hanger leading into book 2?<Cosmic_Flyer>: Can't say I thought that far ahead.

Being the one with the least 'skill', always shunned for my slow reaction times and sloppy aim, I was the one left behind. My explinations of a new router with better connection, and an updated VR set fell on deaf ears. 'Just excuses' they said. They hadn't had to deal with my set-up. I was almost as good as them, while spending less than a quarter on my set up as they did. Now? Well, a week ago, I had won a scratch card. A one in a million chance. There wasn't anything a really *needed* so updating my gaming suite seemed the only thing I could do. &amp;#x200B; I let out one final protest before the wrought iron gates slammed shut, blocking their voices through proximity and 'zones'.

I'm still entitled to 7% of the EXP and rewards as long as I 'guard' the enterence.\" &amp;#x200B; After half an hour, I let out a yawn, beginning to grow bored watching vultures fly overhead. Just then, the ground shook. I launched myself to my feet, summoning my staff to my hand and preparing a basic fire spell. My eyes looked around, only to find... Nothing? No. That wasn't right. Something had happened. Something had changed. I narrowed my eyes and let loose a sensing spell. My awareness spread out like ripples, and only one thing came back. 'Hidden Door, Extremely High Leveled Loot near-by. Medium-High danger.' All three pings came from directly behind me. I turned to find a rock, coloured slightly differently from the rest, jutting out of the cliffside. &amp;#x200B; Walking over, I pressed the tip of my staff to the rock, then watched it depress into the cliffside. More of the stone wall moved, revealing a dark passage. A simple incantation sent a stream of light tunneling down the passage. It was empty. Another sensing spell checked for traps. None. So... Where was the danger? I frowned, walking slowly forwards into the dimly lit corridor. &amp;#x200B; No sooner had I taken 5 steps, the ground below me gave out, and I was falling. A second later, I was sliding. An illusiory wall on the floor, perhaps? I didn't have time to contemplate it, before I was dropped into a large room. Plentiful open spaces, curitives dotted around, huge piles of treasure behind a throne and plenty of collapsed and standing pillars to provide cover. \"Fuck me, I fell into a fucking boss room.\" I cursed my luck and readied myself, before a message appeared before me. &amp;#x200B; *Select Your Loadout.*<Vitalis597>: ***Pyromancer*** *+500% DMG with Fire Element Spells* *+100% Resistance to Fire* *+50% Resistance to Wind* *-50% Weakness to Water* *Unique Passive: Shroud.

Upon your own Death, you automatically possess your nearest summoned undead until your body is reconsituted. If the undead vessel is destroyed, you die permantally.* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; ***Biomancer*** *500% DMG with Life Element Spells* *100% Healing with Life Element Spells* *+100% Resistance to Life* *-100% Resistance to Time* *Unique Passive: Shroud.

You automatically possess the creature if you summon only one, and your body is behind.* *Unique Active: Holy Rays. Using whatever light you can find, you summon a beam of pure Life that destroys all Undead, but heals the living. This can target both friendlies, and enemies.* &amp;#x200B; *Passive: Life's Respite. When your HP drops below 25%, you are teleported to a safer location and summon 10 level 5 creatures in your place* *Passive: Life's Embrace. When in Mortal danger, (below 10% HP) you will be teleported out of combat and 10 level 20 creatures will be summoned in your place.* *Passive: Life's Gambit.

This passive activates upon Death, and instantally rewinds local time by 5 minutes. This Passive is then removed for the next 24 hours.* *Passive: Time's Up. When striking an enemy with 30 or more Time Counters, you have a 50% chance to add 1 more instantally.* &amp;#x200B; I blinked a few times. This... This couldn't be real, right? I read, reread, then read each one again. Just to be sure. My finger hovered over one for a moment. Another window popped up. &amp;#x200B; *This selection is final, and permanant.* &amp;#x200B; Wait-- So, this was a free pass to... What was obviously a Boss level kit? If so, I had to choose carefully. Each one had pros and cons. Life's abilities mostly revolved around healing, and while it saved me from DOT damage, any Burst would fuck me over. Death was awesome, but had little to no defence, other than summoning hordes of level 1 undead to buy me a few seconds. Chronomancer was downright broken in it's own regards, but an inanimate object being my main weakness? No thanks. So... That left Fire? It was good, and healing from my own spells hitting me made it even better... But the Fire kit seemed too hastially thrown together... &amp;#x200B; I took a deep breath, reached out and pressed a button. &amp;#x200B; ***Are you sure?*** &amp;#x200B; *Confirm.*<Vitalis597>: (Tfw you write up so many actives, passives, and abilities that it needs it's own section. xD) &amp;#x200B; No sooner had I pressed the button, I felt myself change. I grew taller, my clothing melted away and was replaced by the chosen kit. Even my staff seemed to contort to accept my new calling. Out of my back burst two wicked wings, ebony and leathery to the touch. The room itself changed, the pillars turning from stone to bone, skulls jutting out at places, and the occasional bone pile littering the floor. The throne itself contorted with my new dark magicks, and as I approached it, floating a few feet from the floor, it formed to fit me perfectly. &amp;#x200B; The room mirrored me perfectly. I let go of my staff, and it simply floated beside my seat. What was once an ordinary stick, was now an 8 foot long bone with a dark orb of magic held inside a human skull. \"Oh dear... I appear to have become a bad guy.\" I chuckled to myself. Even my voice of foreign to myself. Deeper, more malevolant. I liked it. Yet another message appeared. &amp;#x200B; ***10 approach. You may spare 2 as Thralls to accept the other, nerfed offerings, in order to aid you. The rest must die first.*** &amp;#x200B; Well, that was interesting. &amp;#x200B; \"Wait-- Ten?\" I had no more time to contemplate it. The message vanished, and the bone torch sconses died down. My eyes adapted to the darkness quickly. Then, the door edged open. I remained motionless. If the game was going to make me play the part of a Boss Battle... &amp;#x200B; I let out a single casting of Summon the Hord. Several skeletons spawned into existance, crawling out of walls and the floor. Each one held an instrument. I spoke a few short, clipped words, and the orchestra begun. &amp;#x200B; [\"You have come at last.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7wJ8pE2qKU) &amp;#x200B; My voice boomed across the hall, and no sooner had it reached them, did they take a step back. The music, combined with the atmosphere... Well, for this game, music during a Boss Battle was unheard of. It only existed around NPC's, when they were playing, or when a PC decided to play. This certainly was different. &amp;#x200B; The ten walked forwards. I could really pretend to be surprised when I recognised each of them. A low chuckle escaped me. &amp;#x200B; 'Time to show them who the REAL Boss is...' &amp;#x200B; I internally groaned at my horrible pun, immidieatly thankful I didn't say it out loud. &amp;#x200B; My guild looked around the hall. A few shuddered, closing in on each other. That was fine. I'd let them play out their pre-boss interactions. After all. The longer they assumed this would be just another boss battle, the better it would be for me. &amp;#x200B; \"Guys... We should turn back... This boss... Look at it's name!\" \"What do yo-- Wait... Question mark, question mark, question mark?\" &amp;#x200B; \"Yeah... That only shows up for bosses at least 50 levels higher than you... And worse, my Danger Sense is bringing back nothing but 'Run' pings. Even the walls...\" \"Okay. So we play it safe. Theta formation. Alpha through Omega. Play it cards down.\" I chuckled aloud when the leader said that. To anyone else, especially an NPC, it was just words. To me? Theta was prioritising Casters and the defence of Casters. Alpha Through Omega was emphisis on keeping buffs and debuffs up at all times. Cards down was a signal that it could change on the fly. They had just told me their plan, word for word. No doubt, after a Debuff was applied on me, they'd look to strike with a Tank, to redraw aggro back to the front lines. A valid tatic against AI. &amp;#x200B; Against a Human who remembered? Not so much.<Vitalis597>: Predictability at it's finest. The moment a Slow debuff was applied, an arrow flew towards my face, followed by our two tanks bum rushing me. That was fine. &amp;#x200B; I didn't bother rising. My defensive skills were trash. But observation had been my forte before my class change. That stuck around. A Silver tipped arrow. I allowed my Horde to grow once more. This time, by a wraith, in the way of the arrow. It stopped it, died, and then was devoured by an emerald crystal in my chest. Two lesser flesh Golems rose from the ground to deal with the Tanks. &amp;#x200B; A cocky grin slipped across my lips. The leader of our guild, a Paladin, spat on the floor and leveled his finger at me. \"Holy Smite!\" That... That hurt. The beam of light that shot from his finger was faster than ever. Probably because this was his classes chosen Hated Grounds. Mechanics made Paladins stronger in unholy areas, to better help them cleanse them. They were broken as fuck. He had to die first. Unless... &amp;#x200B; Five skeletons crawled from the floor behind the healers, the very back line. They pounced, wielding bone weaponry. Crude, inefficiant, but it certainly got the message across. a piercing scream ripped through the dungeon as one went down. She was quickly healed, but that was enough. I killed the summons myself, absorbing their energies then slowly rising. &amp;#x200B; \"You have seen now, I can strike from anywhere, anyhow, in any manner. You stand no chance. You. Paladin. I offer you a seat, and an ascension to greater powers, still within your healing realm. You can also chose two others of your... Following... To join you.\" &amp;#x200B; My arms spread wide, offering a free shot to any who would take it, or a welcoming embrace to any who took my offer. There was a few looks, the healers were nevrous, rightfully so. The tanks, easily holding their own against the golems, seemed to be considering it too. It wasn't often a boss offered such an ultimatum. &amp;#x200B; \"And the others? What of the seven who aren't chosen? What about them?\" The Paladin spoke up. Just like them, to be so righteous. &amp;#x200B; I cocked an eyebrow in response. \"What about them?\" I challenged. My intent clear. I was a demon, for all intents and purposes. &amp;#x200B; He shook his head. \"No. Not happening.\" &amp;#x200B; Smiles returned to the faces of the guild. They each nodded at his decliration. \"Then so be it. Let us begin this in earnest. If you change your mind... Simply stand by the band.\" I chuckled and waved towards the skeleton orchestra, who seemed to be paying the battle no mind, as if they were uninteractive NPC's. &amp;#x200B; This time, I made the first move. I'd destracted them long enough that the Slow Debuf had worn off. So I dashed forwards, between my golems and the two tanks, straight towards the Paladin. I left the staff behind. Unique actives could be used without it, after all. And my list of Necromancy actives were rather slim. At least, the ones that would be useful right now, anyway. &amp;#x200B; My wings flapped harder and faster than I though possible. Within a half second, without touching the floor, I was in front of the Paladin, one hand wrapped around his head. I squeezed, raised my arm, then let go, easily throwing him 50 feet into the air. He hit the ceiling, then began his decent. He was halted mid-air by a blast from Vassal. Only 6 level 1 souls, but it kept him in the air just long enough for spectral hands to reach out of the ceiling and hold him in place there, hands pinned flat and spread eagled. &amp;#x200B; Unfortunatly, that bought the rest enough time to gather their wits and launch a counter attack. three arrows, two swords and two fire bolts, as well as a weakness to posion debuff hit me, all at once. A second later, the Tanks had gained Improved Physical and Magical Resistances, and were upon me. &amp;#x200B; Internally, I sighed. This could take a while. <Vitalis597>: To match their numbers, I destroyed the flesh golems. They were too slow, and not enough of a threat. I backed up, jumping and using my wings to gain some distance. Archers fired posioned, silver tipped arrows, Casters wove their enchantments to grant Fire and Life Elements to the DPS, and protective buffs to the Tanks. It was slightly intimidating, watching my guild from the outside. Their efficancy was incredible. &amp;#x200B; I tanked the arrows, they hurt, but blocking them would have allowed the DPS to catch me. Instead I summoned Ghouls, Wraiths, minor and regular Zombies, Archers, Swordsmen and even a few of my own casters. Soon, the 1v10 (1v9, not including the Paladin stuck to the ceiling) was a 50v10. A much more even fight. In the background, I, the boss, opted to open a salvo of AoE Life Drain spells. I set them wide and had my troops march into the zones, defending them, stopping the guild from advancing towards me. A wall of lesser Ghosts formed in the air around me, protecting me from future ranged attacks. &amp;#x200B; The bone sconces on the walls lit with green flames. It seemed the game had finally recognised the beginning of the real fight. &amp;#x200B; With a silent thought, the orchestra changed tempo, this time with more recognisable vocals. &amp;#x200B; \"You die before [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15JCb6P60Vw) ends. That, I promise you.\" &amp;#x200B; They all shared a brief glance, before a salvo of fire and light was launched into my army. Arrows still soared towards me, hoping to reapply the posion, but each arrow was blocked by the soul shield I'd constructed. All in all, 100 undead were active in the field, not including the band. In the first 30 seconds, my guild had decimated them, taking minimal damage themselves. So be it. The hands constricting the Paladin faded as their collective souls were absorbed, each one feeding me more power. I raised ten more as the Paladin fell, impacted the ground, and was promptly healed. By the time he was standing, ten fully constructed Nectoric Giants were overshadowing them. One for each guild memeber. I ordered them to act as regular NPC's, for now. It took two casters and an Archer dying, but eventually, I spotted movement from the corner of my eye. Our assassin. She fell from the shadows and spun mid-air. Her strike would have landed. Might have killed me. She was our highest level, after all. But my Staff came to my hand in that moment. &amp;#x200B; \"Rigor.\" Such a simple incantation, and she was rendered motionless for just a second. That was all it took for a leathery wing to crash into her side and send her flying towards the band. She skidded to a stop at their feet as motion returned to her body. I turned to face her, the green gem on my chest glowing lightly. The shot would end her. Highest level, she may be, but she was still just an assassin. Horribly low Constitution. She raised a dagger, then threw it to me. It skidded along the ground and stopped just a foot away from me. &amp;#x200B; \"I yield. I accept your offer. I join you.\" &amp;#x200B; The gem in my chest dimmed, and a smile crossed my features. \"Then welcome... Chronomancer.\" My eyes flicked to the guild, who were finally beating back the Necrotic Giants. The Paladin, second strongest of our Guild, lead the charge against them. His holy powers really were a boon against my summons. Unfortunatly for them, it was now just 6v1. One caster, two tanks, a Paladin, and two archers. &amp;#x200B; The assassin was quickly dragged below the ground by spectral hands. That wasn't my doing. I assumed it was the game, accepting her surrender. After all, I had to win here before I gained her as my thrall. Noting the absence of their assassin, the caster was the next to surrender. I welcomed them as my Pyromancer. My wicked grin grew larger still. \"Only one spot left. Decide quickly, mortals.\" The remaining five looked between each other, then to the door, still open behind them, then back to me. &amp;#x200B; They each nodded once. The archers launched a volly of explosive arrows, enchanted by the Paladins holy magic. It temporarially blinded me. A wing curled around me defensivly, but no attack came. They'd chosen to run out the door, into the inky blackness. Before the could reach it, however, the darkness... Changed. It became fluid, rippling. &amp;#x200B; Drip-drip &amp;#x200B; They froze in their tracks. &amp;#x200B; Drip-drip &amp;#x200B; \"Oh ho, oh no.\" &amp;#x200B; Drip-drip &amp;#x200B; \"Escape was never an option.\" &amp;#x200B; Drip-drip &amp;#x200B; \"Tell me.\" Drip-drip &amp;#x200B; \"Do you remember three weeks back...\" Drip-drip &amp;#x200B; \"You slew a lesser God.\" &amp;#x200B; Drip-drip &amp;#x200B; \"He's back. And he remembers.\" Drip-drip &amp;#x200B; Out from the depths of the darkness, a giant hand emerged, reaching out and grabbing the edge of the door frame. Slowly, the 40 foot undead Lesser God stepped through. &amp;#x200B; The green flames winked out in a gust of wind. The monster exhaled and a gust flung the guild, or what reamined of it, back towards me. A level 100 summon. My last possible summon. I didn't want to do this, but the song was coming to a crescendo. It had to end now. &amp;#x200B; \"I'll join you.\" A broken, defeated voice called out, followed by the pleas of the others. &amp;#x200B; \"Very good, Biomancer. R\u00e1n. Kill the spares.\"<Vitalis597>: PHEW! Okay, so.

Then one day you realize you can use it to punch ghosts.<Edit>: thank you for the gold strangers!<SirLemoncakes>: Everyone always asks me what it felt like to lose my arm. Everyone always asks me what it feels like to no longer have it. One answer I'd always wanted to give but never had the courage to, was that it felt mostly like hopelessness. I had been a pianist, I'd lived and judged my life based on my ability to make people feel with music. I was crippled. I could no longer play my favorite pieces. I could no longer practice new ones. Losing the arm was essentially me losing my life. It's difficult to describe exactly how it feels to have an itch on an arm that isn't there. Imagine the feeling of sitting in a hairdresser's chair and having that annoying little itch crop up on your nose. Now imagine, that your arms are bound to your sides and there's nothing you can do to eliminate that annoying, burning, itch. It's not a terribly nice feeling. I learned that you can scratch your missing limb by using a mirror. You stand in front of the mirror and scratch your opposite arm while you look into your reflection. Remarkably, this works to eliminate the itch. I learned something else while doing just this very thing a few weeks ago. I was standing in front of the mirror, awkwardly scratching my elbow on the corner of my bathroom door, when I saw something in the mirror. A girl with eyes the color of charcoal, teeth yellow as rotten lemons, and blood seeping down her pale, pallid complexion. Before I knew exactly what I was doing, I lashed out with my missing arm. It felt like I did anyway. Something incredible happened, I felt my missing fist smash into the face of the incorporeal entity. I felt her teeth come loose, pain explode in my 'hand' and a ghostly tooth lodge into my fist. I'm not exactly sure who was more surprised, her, or me. Lights began to flicker in the room and objects around my sink began to hover menacingly. My electric toothbrush launched towards my head and I was narrowly able to dodge out of the way. It firmly embedded itself in the wall behind me. Using the mirror as a reference, I leaped on the ghastly girl and smashed my non-existent fist into her face until she stopped squirming. She faded away shortly afterwards. She never bothered me again. I'm not sure exactly where the spirits go after I beat them to a pulp, but I have purpose again. Besides, the pay for someone capable of genuinely dispatching a ghost is fantastic. Honestly, I think people mostly pay for the spectacle of a one armed man fighting an invisible ghost. Now when people ask me what it feels like to be missing an arm, I reply confidently. Sometimes it feels like I never lost it at all. ***************************************** /r/SirLemoncakes.

Her eyes gazed upon me, moving up and down, unsure of what I was doing there. I knew that look, I had seen it countless times before. It was a look I deserved, too many broken promises down memory lane. \u201cWhat exactly is it this time, Jim?\u201d, she asked as she swiped through the tablet\u2019s pages. \u201cJust read it, Beth. This time, it\u2019s something legit. I promise.\u201d There were those two words again. I knew convincing her would take some effort. Given what happened at the communal winter bunker, I couldn\u2019t blame her for second guessing me. She gave me another glance, then looked down again at the tablet in her hands. Her brown hair seemed much longer than the last time I saw her. It had only been 4 months, but it felt much longer. I guess pain can make everything last longer. \u201cI should talk to her.\u201d I thought to myself. Or maybe that was vodka talking. Even after 12 years, I was still head over heels for this woman. If I could go back, I\u2019d changed a lot, but not her, not the kids. They were the only thing I got right. My thoughts drowned out when I could hear her reading. \u201cCongratulations, Mr. Stoddard, after reviewing your application, the EUNA Mars Selection Committee has approved your profile for Pioneer Mission 476. Please arrive at 05:00, July 23rd, 2130, with the following members of your immediate family...\u201d Her eyes shot up to meet mine. \u201cHow\u2019d you get this, Jim? Is this real? Who gave yo-\u201c \u201cIt\u2019s real. I told you it\u2019s legit. I put in the application a couple months ago.\u201d, I said. \u201cReal smart, Jim. You finally have a chance to talk to her and you start with the lies, again.\u201d I thought to myself. Truth was I applied last week, but her and I both know it takes months for these type of approvals. She swiped through the pages, again, still in disbelief. \u201cBut, Jim, I thought Mars was for... Well, you know, not for people like us?\u201d I let out a small sliver of smile. She was right. \u2018Pioneers\u2019 they called \u2018em. Just a fancy word for the rich and the people with real brains. Mars was both out of my pay grade and my ability. But the trip to get there? That\u2019s what guys like me were for. \u201cApparently they need a couple tough New York City welders like me up there.\u201d I said slyly. We both shared a small moment of laughter. I think I missed these moments the most with her. Just her presence was enough to change my mood. I\u2019d do anything and go anywhere for her. Including Mars, apparently. \u201cJim, how are we going to get there? This blizzard hasn\u2019t let up in weeks, and it says here that the ship leaves in 3 weeks.\u201d I could see the worry on her face. No one had been able to leave the summer bunker for over a month because of the blizzard. \u201cI got it all figured out this time, honey. We\u2019re going to be on those ships come launch time. That... kind of, brings up another thing.\u201d She looked at me intently, waiting for the \u2018catch\u2019 she was expecting all along. I smiled as best as I could, \u201cListen, don\u2019t worry, but the thing is you and the kids are going to be on the first ship, and I, well, I have to be on the second one. It\u2019s... well... you see, the trip is 7 months long and they need me on the second ship for my job briefing and training.\u201d I could tell her anxiety was high. I might have been out of her life for the last few months, but she always knew she could walk the four levels that separated our rooms in the bunker. \u201cLook, Beth,\u201d I began as I saw the tears coming to her eyes, \u201cthis is for you and the kids. You have always deserved better, I know that. This is a chance for some real change. The kids will never know this world like we did. The bunkers aren\u2019t where our kids need to be growing up.\u201d She nodded in agreement, tears streaming down her face. \u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cI don\u2019t know, anymore, Jim.\u201d I knew the conversation was coming. I guess, it\u2019s always better after the good news. \u201cBeth,\u201d I stopped her, \u201cLook, we don\u2019t need to talk about this, right now. Let\u2019s just get off this frozen rock and we\u2019ll talk about it then, okay?\u201d I wiped the tears from her eyes like I always did after my screw ups. I leaned in and kissed her cheek. I turned and opened the apartment door. \u201cJim,\u201d she called out. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here, tonight?\u201d \u201cBeth, I don\u2019t think that would be a good thing for us right now.\u201d I said over my shoulder walking out the door. I could hear her sobs from the other side of the door. I wanted nothing more that night than to stay, but I couldn\u2019t let her get close to me again. As I began the four story walk back to my apartment, I popped in my ear buds. I opened the encrypted message on my smart watch, just to hear it one more time. \u201cAs part of our agreement, Mr. Stoddard, Mission 476 - Vessel 2 is not to reach its destination...\u201d<wootangAlpha>: Really really good writing. I'll join in and volley. <wootangAlpha>: Precious hope. People, whether or not you like them, must always have hope. I lay awake from the terrible nightmares. It's a winter night and my skin is soaked with sweat. The morning would bring nothing good. It is unholy. Sleep escapes and evades me like a nineteenth century maiden, always within grasp but never accepting my solicitations. My video dials in the office lines, an AI Secretary I don't recognise starts to speak. \"Mnz Zibhebhu kaMaphitha. This is HOS56 emergency line. Please do respond.\" As the chairman of Psuedo-UN since the actual body was disbanded By the two western powers, availability was not negotiable. Every call, every note, everything not coming from my mouth I must attend directly. Speaking to heads of state and their direct representatives tends to make issues - at best- complicated. \"This is him. Please add transcript and continue.\" I muttered putting on a clean shirt. \"Noted. There has been a new memo submitted and signed by 50 states thus reaching caucus. A new motion to implement a Mars grounding is up for vote at 7am IST. \" \"Were there any notes on why the sudden change of heart?\" I asked with an undertone of hope. Should this motion pass, we will have averted a war. No, not a war but the war that will make all wars of old look like simple games of chess. The destruction will be pure and unadultered, mankind at his best, doing that which comes most naturally to him. We're all adults there. We know and have always known - perhaps it's knowledge stored in our genes - that killing is our masterpiece. Our great joy. The planet once so kind and friendly in old films has turned her head away like a faithful wife scorned and we've yet to feel her fury. We can barely survive if it weren't for that beautiful science, and the brilliant minds who've contributed from when we still lived in caves. Full circle. We are back in the caves. \"Let's do this quickly before someone decides to mobilise. Order all personnel and special advisors to seek out one final attempt at negotiating with the western powers. Anyone, even a doorman will do. Send them the transcriptions.\" I ordered sensing an opportunity. \"Noted. Have a good night sir.\" And she disappeared as easily as she came. A little bit of light. Maybe, just maybe we'll get through to someone. My final thought before I drifted away into that place we dream of. \"Motion passed.\" I shouted to a large applause. \"Now. I have not received any word from the western powers and so we shall proceed with the grounding. Director of Operations Mr. SangMin Lee will brief us on the process.\" \"Thank you chair\" SangMin said with a knowing look and a weak wink. We were old buddies from university and we'd both been very interested in computing. After a few years we convinced each other that politics is the way forward and so we both climbed the ranks of various international organizations. \"This operation was the last resort should we recieve no word on further negotiations. As you are aware, we cannot pursue our own space peograms as many of our economies are in tatters. We can barely get food on the table and we've been thrust back into the dark ages. Our governments decided to send their best minds to work on the Mars projects based in Hamburg, Germany and California, US. It later emerged that those allowed to board must be natural citizens ,with certain traits and abilities, wealth or high potential. The UN intervention convened and ended up with the two most powerful forces coaxing their continental sister countries to disband and dismantle the UN, ICC and NATO...\" SangMin had decided to pause for dramatic effect. \"We as a temporary organization need to take measures to include a fair and equal distribution of people on Mars so that Earth culture is preserved. At the very least a nuclear family of one child with bith parents as custodians of cultures and traditions that would otherwise be lost forever.\" \"We will negotiate with the US to let I send electives instead of ourselves. These people will have the duty to preserve Earth culture on Martian soil. By preventing the ship's from ever reaching their destination.\" The room was dead. Not a soul dared to breathe. Silence was in the air like a humid gust of wind. <XtricateOneM>: Nice! I\u2019ll follow up shortly!<XtricateOneM>: I turned over in my bunk. Sleep was getting harder to come by every night since the ship's launch two months ago. Most of the nights I couldn't sleep knowing that I had to do the unthinkable at some point, other nights it was due to the endless partying in the workers' bay where they kept us less desirable people. I rolled to the edge of my top bunk to look down at the alarm clock. &amp;#x200B; *03:30* &amp;#x200B; \"Awake again tonight, Jimbo?\" My lower bunk mate whispered. &amp;#x200B; \"Yeah, Marty, can't seem to get some shut eye these last few nights.\" I whispered back. &amp;#x200B; Marty was also from New York City. Well, what was left of it anyways. I was glad to hear a familiar accent when we met before launch. I wanted to lay low and not make any friends, I figured it would be easier that way. But Marty, well Marty is the kind of guy that doesn't let anyone feel left out. When you hear about good guys out there, Marty is the best of 'em. His smile is that contagious type of smile. His brown eyes squint and twinkle when he's happy, which is almost all the time. If you asked him, love and happiness is only one hoagie away. &amp;#x200B; \"Yeah, I've been having a hard time sleep, too. Can you believe someone on this ship might be trying to kill everybody?\" He asked so innocently. &amp;#x200B; Everyone was briefed on it a few weeks after launch that someone might be trying to bring down the ship. Apparently, the ship's intelligence group picked up on some chatter from the ground about a small group out of Asia wanting a piece of Mars. The whole ship has been on high alert ever since. &amp;#x200B; \"It's some crazy stuff, I know.\" I replied. \"You know Marty, I was thinking, maybe you can show me how to make that meatball and salami sandwich I always hear you bragging about. I want to show Beth and the kids over video chat once you teach me.\" I always tried to change the subject when it gets brought up. &amp;#x200B; \"You really want to know?\" Marty's excitement was loud enough to wake up half the people around us. \"It all starts with picking the right bread.\" &amp;#x200B; I always knew when Marty was about to start on a long soapbox. I let him talk as my thoughts turned to Beth and the kids. I hadn't talked to them in a couple of days. I knew that they were doing alright. Beth was scared about their ship being brought down instead of mine. The kids were more excited than anything. &amp;#x200B; *She's going to know, you know?* I thought to myself. &amp;#x200B; *She's going to know that you brought down the ship and that blood was what paid for her and the kids' trip to Mars.* &amp;#x200B; I turned over once more, hearing Marty going on and on about meatballs, then drifted to sleep. &amp;#x200B; \"ATTENTION! ATTENTION!,\" I woke to the sound of the large intercom system, \"All citizens are required to report directly to the sports arena immediately.\" &amp;#x200B; I looked down at Marty who was struggling to get untangled from his sheets. &amp;#x200B; \"Wh-what do you think is going on, Jim?\" He asked as he fell from his bunk. &amp;#x200B; \"I'm not sure.\" I said smiling at the mess of Marty on the floor. &amp;#x200B; I quickly got dressed and put my boots on. I walked out of the workers' bay and waited for Marty by the exit. He eventually came out barely put together. &amp;#x200B; \"You might want to tie that shoe, Marty. We got a long walk ahead of us.\" I said as I pointed towards his shoes. &amp;#x200B; The ship we were on was gigantic. It had to be. It had to hold a population the size of 5,000 and meet everyone's needs. Food, water, entertainment, everything was included on board the ship. The sports arena held all the seasonal sports. The only other arena that I knew of was the one in the main bunker back on Earth. All the other bunkers would watch the sports play out on the television. The one on the ship was a bit smaller than what the one on Earth looked on TV. We quietly made our way up to the sports arena. The walk and a couple elevator rides took us about 30 minutes until we found our seats at the arena. &amp;#x200B; After everyone took their seats, a small security group walked to the center of the arena. In the middle of the group was a handcuffed man with a black bag on his head. One of the security people stepped in front of the microphone. &amp;#x200B; \"Good morning, citizens. My name is Captain Sean Merlot. As many of you know, when we set out on this voyage, you were alerted that there may be an individual on this ship acting as a saboteur. We have recently captured this individual, and held a private trial to avoid public hysteria. This individual has a family aboard ship one. To avoid threats and harm to those family members, we have accepted the saboteur's wish to keep his name private.\" &amp;#x200B; Several members of the crowd began to shout and boo. A small area started to get rough and security officers pushed through with their batons to quiet them down. It was clear that the Captain was still speaking, but his voice was muffled by the roaring crowd. &amp;#x200B; Captain Merlot withdrew the pistol in his side holster, placed it against the head of the bagged man and pulled the trigger. &amp;#x200B; The whole crowd fell silent in disbelief. &amp;#x200B; \"We will not tolerate threats and actions against this ship.\" Captain Merlot stated with no remorse. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;<XtricateOneM>: I\u2019ll write more in a bit!<EatUnicornBacon>: Please don't.", "num_messages": 8, "avg_score": 1.75}

The morning sunrise is filtered through the blinds, causing strips of faint light to project themselves onto the floor of the room. I watch as they gradually strengthen, turning into golden rays in the process. It slows down until the change is barely noticeable. Time for breakfast I suppose. _'Another sandwhich huh?'_ I say to myself as I bite into the bread. Turning my head towards the window, I gaze outside as the radiant sun rises over the city skyline. A large billboard on the side of a corporate building briefly displays the current time. _\"Good morning, good people of Atlas. It is 7:00.\"_ A female's voice announces. It's volume is booming, but it's tone is smooth. _\"This message was brought to you by Sion Systems, bringing you the technology of tomorrow, today.\"_ I take another bite from the sandwhich, letting the melted cheese spill onto my shirt. No one was gonna see it anyway. \"Today's too good for work.\" ___________ The clock was ticking. \"Are you sure you can't come today?\" The voice belonging to my boss says. \"If it's a cold or a fever, I can have some Uni-Serum available for you when you arrive. On me, of course.\" \"No thanks, boss.\" I respond, pretending to sound fatigued. \"I just feel... tired. More tired than usual, I mean. I can't explain it any other way.\" \"Well, you have been working very hard on Project C...\" A loud sound rang in the background. \"There's something I need to address. I suppose you deserve your day off. Use it well, and be ready for work when you come back.\" His footsteps faded as he hurriedly shuffled off, forgetting to end the call. I ended it for him. While I did feel bad for lying to him, I ultimately felt like I had made the correct choice. I looked up at the clock on my wall as I ate the last portion of the sandwhich. It wasn't moving. ___________ The clock was ticking. At least, it was. Perhaps something's wrong with the batteries? No, it's solar powered. Perhaps something to do with the internals of the clock itself? No, it was a digital. As I thought to myself of the possibilities, I looked down at the floor in thought. That's when I saw something. The light streaks from before. They were fading. They couldn't be, it was only morning time! I glanced at the wall clock again, which, however, stated otherwise. In fact, it was going backwards. __________ The clock was ticking. Backwards, but ticking. \"Something's wrong with Project C!\" My boss frantically panted to me over the call. \"It was supposed to travel back in time, not make time go backwards!\" \"It's not necessarily going backwards, per se. If it was, we'd be doing what we were doing this morning, in reverse.\" \"I suppose that's true, but still. Eventually, the general public will notice, and there'll be civil unrest!\" The boss blurted in panicked statements. \"Try turning it off first, then checking the internals to see if everything's in the right places...\" I suggested, trailing off near the end. \"But I don't know what is supposed to be where. The only person that does... is you.\" \"But I'm on break, so-\" \"Do you not understand the gravity of the situation?! Time is literally moving backwards and you're concerned about your day off?!\" \"Yes. I'm gonna go watch the sunrise again. Or rather, the sunset.\" \"Travis Gerald Livingston, if you do not report in right this moment I will-\" And with that, I ended the call.

He couldn't give an explanation as to *why* the Honorable General Hanz Druffenmahk's voice was clearing announcing he surrender of their territory to those filthy Alliance invaders! It was, of course, impossible! The General himself was sitting across the table from him, his eyes bulging out of his head, his cheeks getting redder and redder, and his mouth fully clamped down on a spoon full of scalloped potatoes.

There was a distinct sound of glass being crushed. The Colonel looked down to confirm it was his monocle that had suffered under the iron boot of the General. \"Oh my. If you would excuse me, my General! I must go fetch a replacement monocle. I will return quickly, very quickly!\" The Colonel rushed from the room, made sure the door was firmly shut behind him, bit his knuckles with enough force to leave a good imprint on them for a dentist, then he shouted for the sergeant. \"SERGEANT SHULZ!\" The Colonel bellowed. \"SHULZ!\" Shulz shuffled out of the hall, his face as round and as pale as a wheel of cheese beneath his mustache. \"Vhat is ze meaning of this?

And a few month ago, everything changed. It was just my typical morning routine, waking up, coffee, shower, coffee, turning the computer on, looking through the window... Our civilisation grew impressively fast compared to yours, and the pollution, while being purified before reaching the atmosphere, is still there over the cities and it creates strange climates, especially acid rains. As I watched a bird trying to take altitude through the corrosive water, I thought to myself that this world wasn't... \"good\". Yes the humans lives for hundreds of years. Yes we eat and drink as much as we want. But we only protect ourselves. I saw in books what the world looked like before, when we weren't that developed. Forests. Lakes. Jungles. (You know those, you who read these lines. I know you do.) We lost it all. We destroyed the nature with what it gave us to live longer, not realizing that by doing so we lost what nature is really supposed to be. As I was realizing it, I felt a cold sweat in my back. Why was I the only one seeing the truth? Why was I the only one who could do nothing about it? I was the subhuman after all... The best of the worst. The one that was skillfull, but not talented. Tears started rolling down my cheeks as I said through my teeth : \"- I want to change everything. Everything in this world.\" \"Hello.\" I started looking around me, searching for the sudden voice. \"... Hello ? - user admin confirmed, state what you would like to change.\" It was right there, in front of me. A perfect segmented circle, hovering in front of me, moving with my sight, like printed on my retina, slowly rotating. \"I... Uh... I would like... Who are you? -I am a representation of Admin's soul. -Of Admin's soul? Of... Of my soul then? -Yes. -But... Are you... Perhaps... My power? -What would you like to change, Admin? -You didn't answer my.. -What would you like to change, Admin? -I don't know!! Refill my coffee? \" The second my sentence was finished, I saw a second cup of coffee, identical to mine, right next to the other one, but full. It took me a few seconds to realize. This power, it was mine! Me, the subhuman, I could do this kind of things. But what kind of thing exactly ? \" I... What can you do for me? -Anything. -Anything... like what? -anything.\" It was starting to bother me. \" well then change the weather. -very well, admin. -You see you cannot... What ??\" I instantly looked out the window to see the rain slowly slowing down, getting thicker. Snow. I only ever saw snow in books I could not believe my eyes. \"you.. Can you.. Change me ? Give me.. An other power for exemple? -Certainly, what would you want, Admin?\" As you can imagine, this was a good day and today, a few months after this event, I turned this world around. I cannot get forests back since I don't know what they feel like, what they look like if you see them with your own eyes, if you lose yourself in them, but at least we won't go further. But I found out other worlds. Other places. Your world. You have forests, you have jungles, I saw your seas and oceans. They are full of life. You live with animals, you tamed them. You are much closer to nature than anyone ever was in my world for the past centuries. I won't let you go on the wrong path. Today is the day everything changes for you. You will hear of me. Soon. I now can send messages in your world, it's only a matter of time before I will be able to join it. See you soon. \"xoxo\" u/Slauwdy Edit : misspells, typo, and added a bit more logic. <ThatSpookyChill>: Well written :)<Slauwdy>: Thanks, glad you liked it! it's far from what I usually write tho, I did this one at work in a few minutes and I don't have the time to double check mistakes or spelling (I tend to misspell a lot since English is not my first language) Most of the time I write for myself or for tabletop rpgs so it's the first time I try something like that haha! <ThatSpookyChill>: Well that makes it even more impressive.

The prospects of meeting lord Quol kept him awake for weeks, but it had been necessary. The incident with Discover and the little Alphanian boy had ruined their initial passive relationship with the natives, and that needed fixing. After locking up Discovery in one of the native's prison cells and transferring some of the human resources to the Alpha, a conflict seemed to be averted. The warmth of the sun, and the rustling of the high grasses brightened his mood as he reached their campsite. His enthusiasm suddenly peaked when he set sight on Saveus. 'Does it work? did you fix it?' Leaning on a giant device, Saveus smiled broadly and made a vocal answer redundant. Lumos couldn't believe it. The 4 meter QuantumLens's lights were blinking and it's internals were buzzing. It would be the first time they could see the earth's current state. Telescopes had given them the opportunity to see 18 years into the past, but the QuantumLens had the prospects to be able to see their real-time, current state. 'I've already found their sun, I'm still calibrating it to find and track earth though' he noted, to not pump the hype to the maximum. But it didn't bother Lumos a bit. Knowing Saveus, calibrating would take a few days at most. After that they would finally be able to see what they where left out on. 'Are we in trouble?' asked Saveus, suddenly dead serious. 'Probably not, on short-term anyway.' said Lumos, trying to not show sadness, but not being sure if it worked. Discovery was one of his dearest playmates on the spaceship to Alpha, and it was saddening that he had to be locked up. The rest of the crew didn't like that he tried everything to keep Disco out of prison. But he didn't feel guilty about it, because it was partly their fault that he only had him to begin with. 'I'm going to check on Olivia' Lumos walked away without another look; he didn't want to defend himself again, and their common goal was far more important than interpersonal struggles. 'Oy, Olli, hows the engine?' A small, mouse-like head popped out of the top of the giant CoreEngine. 'Great, but a bit amateuristic I suppose' She jumped in sight and of the engine before she continued. 'Their like \"*Let's create a CoreEngine*\" and \"*Let's create a QuantumDrive*\" but putting 1 and 1 together was difficult I suppose' she said, clearly very fond of herself, but with a little self-mockery. 'But can you make it work with local fuels?' asked Lumos, a little annoyed by the fact that Olivia always seemed to derive from the task at hand. 'Well, it's just like I said, if we just harvest the power from the QuantumDrive and only use the CoreEngine as a boost and align mechanism, we can just use the fusion particles as fuel. 1 liter can make us travel 1 lightyear in frozen-time speed' She was clearly irritated by my disinterest in her previous story. But then she should have told him earlier that this solves the problem. 'Great work, keep it up' 'Would have kept it up anyway, *captain*' she mumbled, still irritated, while climbing back on the CoreEngine. Lumos felt the invitation to leave floating in the air, so he did. Noa and Archy were pulling a heavy cart when Lumos left the rocket site. 'Lumos, what you doin' here, you are supposed to negotiate with the locals, remember?' panicked Noa, who forgot they were pulling a cart and surprising Archy by suddenly letting go of the handle. 'NOA!' She quickly grabbed it again, but kept her confused gaze on Lumos. 'Already done, Discovery is in custody and I gave them some earth foods, they loved it, how was your quest?' Lumos was keen on averting and changing the subject of Disco at every opportunity. Archy throw a laugh at him which suggested success, and after halting the cart in a safe place she showed him. A small metallic-looking device. After wispering in it she made a small gesture and a creature of light emerged. It had big blades as arms. The creature sliced the grass in equal portions and disappeared. 'Alpha's weapons are amazing, those creatures can't be destroyed, can be summoned in armies and will only stop when their instructions are complete. This will help us a lot. Earth will never see us coming.'<SummoningDragon>: Oh shit. I did NOT see that coming.

The crowd's roar echoes through the arena. The Coliseum is full tonight, and the sand already smells of blood. Also, it smells of burnt rubber, gasoline, and gunpowder. You sit back down in your 'chariot' and start the engine. You are a Gladiator. <SirLemoncakes>: The cheers of the crowd reverberate through the Coliseum, their frenzied shouts ignite my blood, fuel the engine of my heart. The smell of burned rubber and spilled blood is like a perfume, heavy on the night air. The night is split by a hundred spotlights, their heat is sweltering. My chariot spits and coughs, it rumbles and begs to be unleashed. I pat my weapon, my partner, my friend on the steering wheel. Another challenger rolls through the gate, her chariot growls and roars, the tires scream as they drive into view. The announcer silences the crowd with a display of pyrotechnics, their sign to shut the hell up. A voice, loud and golden cries out, \"Are you ready to see your champion take on another challenger!? For the first time in decades, we have two in one day!\" The crowd thunders its approval, another burst of fire slowly silences them. \"On the west side of the track, you know her, you love her! Our longest time champ! RUTH RAGNOROK!\" I throw my fist into the air, soaking in the applause, the bloodlust. Multiple bursts of fire silence the crowd. \"On the east side, we have a fast growing phenomenon! You watched her take on Rory the Ripper! You gazed on as she Gored Georgia the Gluttonous! You cheered as she ripped Susan the Bruisen literally in half! I give you, the challenger, Mary Mayhem!\" The crowd loses its mind, they are ravenous for this fight. I'd heard about this challenger, but had no idea she would be so popular. I take my seat, running through the equipment check. Everything is ready. I press a button, a flare burst from my chariot, a red light arcing through the sky. The announcer screams out over the intercom, \"Ruth Ragnorok is ready! Challenger, are you ready?\" A green flare launches up into the air, my engine revs, my chariot trembles in anticipation. \"Mary Mayhem is ready! 3...2...1...LET EM' ROAR!!\" The call for battle done, I slam my foot into the accelerator. The chariot's wheels kick up the bloody sand in a spray before kicking forward madly. The sound of engines screaming for blood pushes everything else out of my mind. We are one creature, one body. We fly over a dune, the challenger driving to meet us head on. Flipping a switch, I send a missile arcing throug the air -- flares burst out in a fan, the missile lands off course. I see the flash of bullet fire, I swerve side to side. Thudding sounds cut through the madness, they had hit my girl. A scream of fury escapes me, I press a button, a wall of crackling electricity surrounds my chariot. Bullets are turned to slag before they can reach me. We drive past one another, I see the woman, her face a mask of sheer fucking pleasure. I laugh, \"I'm gonna kill you bitch!\" as we pass. I slam the wheel to the side, spinning the chariot around to face Mary, she did the same. Flicking a switch, a ramming targe lowers in front of me. I rev my engine, the sound silences even the crowd. I watch with pleasure as she lowers her targe as well. We rev our engine loudly and burst forward, both of us on a head on collision course. Just as we are about to collide, I flip another switch. My trump card. An electromagnetic force hums to life. I grin with anticipation, this is how I always win. Not fair but it works. I place my hand on the dial, ready to turn it up to maximum. Just before we collide, I turn the dial up to max. Nothing happens. Usually, the enemy chariot would shift course, just a bit. My targe would pierce them, they would glance off. I feel my chariot jerk slightly to the side. \"Shit!\" I scream, before the enemy targe rips through my chariot. The new champion rides a circle around the arena, her engine roaring its satisfaction. The crowd echoing the engine. \"I don't believe it! The champion is dead! Long live the champion!\" My body smolders in the ruin of my chariot, my breath comes out in choked gasps. I hear a chariot drive up to the side of my wreck. Boots on the sand as Mary walks up to the ruin. She crouches beside me and says, \"You killed my mother with that trick. But I figured it out. Nonferrous metal bitch,\" she spits on me before hauling me to my feet. The crowd roars, they loved me, but love turns to hate when you lose. The Queen of the Arena steps out onto her parapet, and gives the thumbs down. Mary picks up a piece of shrapnel from my chariot, and slits my neck. My conciousness slowly fades to the sound of uproarious applause. _____________________ /r/SirLemoncakes<jpeezey>: I always get excited when I see your username pop up in my inbox with a story response, and this one is another perfect example of why.

I especially like when she describes herself and her chariot as being one creature. It gives a lot of insight as to her character. I'm sad Ruth bites it in the end. If you ever wanted to do more with this, you could have her survive, and the story be about her fall and return to 'grace' after this battle.

You get woken up by the coffin opening and quickly discover that it's been ten thousand years. <_WeAreAllToBlame_>: Something was off. Perched beside the gargoyle atop the church, visually, everything was in place. People were bustling along the street, screaming \"wooo\" into their smartphones as they hopped from one bar to anothe , the putrid smell of the dead meat on pizza and burgers wafted through the air into Glenys' face, and in the vicinity a small commotion was taking place as another drunk vegan screamed about the moral decay in his society. It didn't feel like any time had passed, but something was off. Glenys' couldn't quite put her finger on it, but these humans didn't smell like they used to. She was getting hungry though and her first meal after seeing moonlight again hadn't been quite to her taste. They didn't taste the same anymore either. \"Whatever, blood is blood\" she thought to herself as she dropped down to street level in a dark alley. Her senses were keen and she kept her wits about her, lest those pesky hunters show up again. At a leisurely pace, the vampire strolled out from the alley. Not only had the wait seemed really long, but that had been the first time anybody had caught her. Ever. Years of honing her skills as a silent killer and she didn't even know how they had gotten the drop on her. It was disconcerting to say the least. Prey was easiest to hunt in an inebriated state. Glenys dropped into the shadiest and loudest bar she could find. Here, screening the insufficiently lit room, participants (possibly even willing) were always to be found. Just as the thought popped up, she noticed a woman staring intently at her. It quickly became clear as Glenys' sauntered closer, that this wasn't a look of disgust. The smell of pheromones emanating from her would've attracted a herd of wildebeast to this woman. An intense desire washed over Glenys. Caution was advised. 3 shots of a dark red liquid, that tasted like fermented bark, later and some cajoling, the two were in a bathroom stall orally exchanging fluids. The taste of those \"lakrids vodka\" shots still very much present. \"Go ahead, bite me!\" whispered the dark haired woman into Glenys's ear, as the music thumped against the walls and drowned out any other noise the two made. \"Ah, one of these humans\" Glenys thought to herself as she smiled. A hiss of pleasure and pain escaped the human as Glenys' teeth pierced the skin on lady's neck to transport the vampire into a world of bliss. Her eyes closed and the music faded to be replaced by a spiking heartbeat and a human yet foreign taste - a marvelous taste. Sucking deeply, memory flashes came to her mixed with those that weren't her own. Glenys's eyes snapped open. Epigenic literacy through blood consumption was a talent gained after at least a thousand years as a vampire. Glenys was only 96, but that wasn't the major thing bugging her. This human had seen what looked like the future. But there had been more than just what her eyes had seen. A wave of euphoria and pride had filled this human during the moment she had experienced. It had been very, very real. Unable to contain her stupefaction and bewilderment, she pulled away from the human and stuttered \"D-D-Dyson sphere?\" -------------- Feedback welcome<HiroshimaMan>: Wait, what?<_WeAreAllToBlame_>: What?<mewe0>: i assume hiroshimaman doesnt know about the dyson sphere, i know i dont know what it is<_WeAreAllToBlame_>: &gt;A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that completely encompasses a star and captures a large percentage of its power output. <https>://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere [A more in depth explanation (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxSY1tsI1NA) (prelude until [2:33](https://youtu.be/jxSY1tsI1NA?t=2m33s) explaining why we would need something like that)<mewe0>: oooh i think i mightve heard of that in maybe endless space game? anywhoo, alright that took a turn for fantasy i didnt expect", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 14.1428571429}

I had a brother, but we weren't very close. Likely I'll go out around the time he does. Which, honestly, could be any day now.

He didn't know who this guy was, but clearly a lot of people did. \"So, you're still a big deal, then?\" he said, still looking up at the void above, pleasantly. \"Not in the slightest. People don't remember who I was, but they keep mentioning my name, with me in mind. It's the only thing tying me to this wretched place, their incessant name calling!!\" he screamed at Jimmy, but Jimmy didn't mind. It was the first guy he met with gray hair in this world, he probably had a right to be upset. \"How can you not be a big deal, but people remember you?\" \"I told you! The name! It's my cursed name! I tried to change it in this world so that I wouldn't be remembered, but it doesn't work like that.\" He stepped close to Jimmy, eyes twitching and fingers shaking wildly. \"Did you know I used to be fascinated with this plane of existence? Just look around us! It disproves everything I thought about the universe. But I found out long ago that we're not on any plane of existence, so I suppose that point is moot.\" He shook his head, impatient with his inability to stay on one topic for very long. \"Look, Al, I really think you got something mixed up. You stay as long as people remember you. And therefore they do. Who were you when you were alive?\" \"Have you heard of Louis Armstrong?\" \"Uhhh.. can't say that I have?

He slowly started flaking apart. \"Ah, looks like my brother's out, Al,\" he said, smiling. \"Indeed so,\" he said bitterly. As agitated as he was, he enjoyed having someone to talk to. Someone who would listen instead of call him a crazy old man or by his name. How he hated his name. \"Chin up, Al. I'm sure you'll be forgotten, soon.

Now, humanity lives in packs and war tribes, fighting for every last bit of resources. You just found a pokeball, burried in the sand, forgotten and forlorn.... <espeonahj>: It's like I've seen a ghost. Or some other unimaginable, fantasy thing. My heart skips a beat as I struggle to assimilate the present moment. It's been countless years since I saw a pokeball. And here, of all places... As if it had been in the ocean's cold embrace all this time, waiting patiently to wash upon this shore. I don't hesitate - I pick up the mystical device, press the button, and marvel as its size increases. I'm suddenly inundated by thoughts of my dad - the greatest champion the former-Hoenn region had ever seen. By the time I could walk he had already given my first Pokemon, the most loyal Bagon that ever lived. He was training me to become a champion myself when I came of age. To be someone that could make my people proud. Of course, all of that changed when Sinnoh invaded. They struck first right in the heart of Hoenn - Mauville City. Overnight an entire country was left without electricity. Their army moved systematically, from city to city, taking everyone's Pokemon and obliterating their opposition. It was too fast for anyone to understand what was happening, and too fast for us to organize ourselves and react. My father as champion was on the front lines, and he fearlessly pitted himself and his team against the marauders. However, Sinnoh had managed to capture the Legendary Pokemon controlling both time and space, and thus their victory was all but inevitable. My father fell in battle, and his body was never recovered. His Pokemon fell into the hands of our enemies. When they finally arrived in Dewford town, they went house to house taking everyone's beloved Pokemon. Brawly was taken as a prisoner of war, and the Dewford gym was burnt to the ground. My dear Bagon... How it cried out for me as it was ripped from my arms, and how I was powerless to do anything... All of this flashes through my mind, and in a second I touch the button again and throw the pokeball. Out emerges a precious, green fairy-esque creature that looks to me with expectant eyes. It flutters about with its short wings, rushing over the glistening ocean water and back again. It's obviously overjoyed to have been released from its small capsule, and I feel a sudden warmness inside me. Something the likes of which I haven't felt since... Before. It positions itself in front of me again, and I'm at a loss. I'm unsure if I'm dreaming, or if something miraculous has just truly happened. No one has Pokemon anymore. They've become things of legend. To have one in front of me right now... As I'm entrenched in thought, I don't notice as the little one reaches out and touches me. Instantly, everything stops. The waves freeze mid-crash, the leaves in the forest behind me stop rustling, and all that still moves is me and this Pokemon. What's happening? I should start returning to the village; the sun will be setting before too long. Slowly, and impossibly, the sun begins to move again. However, it does not dissappear over the horizon. Instead, it begins to rise. Within seconds it's directly overhead, and then it's behind us, where it rose this morning. The change accelerates, and my heart begins pounding. I feel the adrenaline soar through my veins as I struggle to find an adequate reaction. Sensing my frenzy, the little green miracle looks to me with resolution in its eyes. I make out a faint smile on its face before I lose consciousness. I hear one last thing before all goes black - the Pokemon. \"Ce-ce-ceeeelebii!\"<uplade3>: Holy crap this was perfect.<espeonahj>: Haha glad you enjoyed it (-:", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 11.75}

I kept screaming \"No! I didn't want to kill them! I didn't know!\" But everyone there ignored me. The priest--in colorful, ceremonial garb, took the dagger off the dais beside the altar, and gripped it in his hand. He looked at me, a stern anger radiating from his face as he lifted the knife above his head, to plunge it into my chest. I stopped screaming, accepting my fate, and turned my head to look down the steps of the pyramid and onto the people below. Most of them were already dead or dying. The few who could stand made sure to stand as far away from me as possible. -------------------- The time machine had worked, in a sense. I was transported in time, yes, but instead of jumping ahead by an hour, I was sent back several hundred years. Also, while the machine accounted for earth's orbit and the sun's position in the galactic plane, it didn't account for Earth's rotation, and so instead of ending up in Perth, Australia, I ended up in a primitive stone city somewhere in South America. At least I didn't end up in an ocean somewhere. I had my smart phone with me, and, since I could think of nothing else to do, I used it to try to stop the Spanish conquest by warning the local people there of what was coming--war and disease. However, the language difference made it nearly impossible for those around me to understand me. Also, I looked *weird* to them, me being a pasty white scientist to their ruddy skinned farmers or soldiers. I was reguarded as an \"outsider\", and while no one treated me with open hostility, people generally made sure to treat me with caution. They definitely shied away from me when I pulled out this strange, glowing device whenever I used it to consult a particular fact. I tried drawing pictures to convey the message that the invaders were coming. I drew sailing ships, cannons, swords, skulls, bones, whatever I could think of to try to convince these people that something horrible was coming. My crude drawings were passed around and looked at, before people started giving me gold in exchange for these pictures. For two years, I used everything in my imagination to try to warn them of the coming apocalypse. I moved from city to city, desperately begging people to listen to what I was trying to tell them, but no one understood me. I noticed that whenever I visited a particular city more than once, that there were less people there to greet me. I finally used the gold I was given to purchase a small house, a place to at least lay my head in between traveling and spreading the bad news. What I didn't realize is that I had also been spreading something else. They kicked down the door of my house one night and roughly grabbed me off of my bed, screaming in their incomprehensible language while others pointed their clubs at me. I could see the sections of sharp obsidian that had been forced into these clubs in the torch light. A crowd of people stood outside my modest house, holding more torches--some screaming, others talking, others standing silently to watch the spectacle. Almost all of them had a strange cough every now and then--a wet, mucous cough that startled me. The crowd parted as the soldiers--dessed in their war clothing, with strange helmets depicting birds and all manner of beasts and fish on their heads--dragged me through the street towards what I deduced was their jail. I could also see the rows of sick people lining the street outside the local doctor's house. That's when I realized what was happening. Wherever I went, people started getting sick. Then, they started dying. The cities I had come to and gone from had been emptied by the myriad diseases my body carried and fought off as part of its normal routine. The people around me had no such immunity to the diseases I had inadvertently brought with me from several hundred years in the future. I started begging, pleading to the soldiers dragging me into their jail that I didn't mean to kill them; that it was all a mistake. No one listened as I was thrown in a hole to await my fate. --------------------- As the priest's knife plunged into my chest and started to carve around my heart, my last realization was that, rather than saving this civilization from ruin, I had only hastened its end.<nProzac>: Shit son, that was some interesting spin", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 2.0}

Spoiler time! This is my first ever post on well, anything around here! I also lack a lot of info about this universe, just watched a few episodes here and there! Thanks for taking the time to read it! &amp;#x200B; It took months, no\u2026 no\u2026 it took over a year to finally do this. I was often recognized as the crazy person in town, sitting in the outskirts of the town just practicing day in and day out. There was never a day I took a break. I started out as a normal fire bender, throwing fireballs and streaks of flames into the air left, right and center. As time passed and my training continued in the academy, I finally dropped out and left, I knew I was just going to be like everyone else. I took what money I had left and just moved in and got an old job as a farmer, tending crops for others. It was a low-earning job and it gave me just enough to live off of, and that\u2019s all I ever needed. I spent months in that old town, doing nothing but practicing my fire bending\u2026 well not just my fire bending but my lightning bending. Just like how most people shoot fire out of their hands I shoot lightning out like it\u2019s nothing now, throwing out forks and streams of pure energy at my targets. A few times I nearly killed someone just by accident, but I\u2019ve gotten better with it, able to heat things perfectly with it, charge anything with it\u2026 it\u2019s quite amazing, much more elegant compared to normal fire bending. As I\u2019ve continued to practice it every day for the past few months I\u2019ve been able to pull energy out of things that, of course, use energy. I\u2019ve made light bulbs explode into arcs of lightning and more. But there is a much darker side to this story\u2026 I was finally reading into more anatomy, figuring out how to position myself best, give myself the most air and what not when I fell upon the discovery that we are all controlled by electronic pulses in our systems, controlling everything we do. I read more and more into this and finally decided to give it a try, knowing that it most likely won\u2019t work at all, but that didn\u2019t stop me. It had been raining quite heavily the day before, so there were plenty of creatures to test on outside, after many hours of practice on a frog I was able to get it to move around without its own control, getting it to jump up and down for no reason at all. Someone, somewhere must of seen this though, as the next day there was a Fire Nation Official knocking on my door asking a lot of questions, I finally became annoyed and slammed the door on him. It wasn\u2019t but a few hours later that he came back with a few more guards to take me into custody. In a flurry of anger I zapped one and forced the other to stab the Official, he was terrified by his actions and turned tail to run. As of writing this I am both the best kept secret and the most wanted person in this side of the world\u2026 This blessing is also a curse\u2026 A couple of times I\u2019ve tried it on myself, moving my other arm or moving fingers\u2026 It\u2019s the single most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life, forcing energy into nerves and arcing them from one to another.

We had the tech to send something or someone back in time, but the tech itself could not go back. That is the machine would send you and your stuff back, but the machine itself would not go. Science! So...one way trip. We had a plan though. Send me back as an \"observer\". Send someone back with the tech that could survive being buried in the desert for over 2000 years. That tech would be the record, the truth, of what really happened. Digital recordings, photos, personal observations. Everything needed to prove or disprove Him. I was chosen because I would fit in. Looks, height...all that. Couldn't send a 6ft tall white guy back over 2000 years to that part of the world. Wouldn't exactly blend in after all. I studied the ancient languages and customs and was prepped as well as anyone could be. The target time period for arrival would be a few years before the beginning of His mission. Enough time to get my bearings and find my way to Him. I vomited and then passed out as soon as I arrived. Time travel is a bitch. I'm not sure how much time had elapsed when I came to. The sun was going down and I was hungry. I set about to...well...get settled. I won't bore you with the details of life in 1st century Judea. I worked, I ate, I lived. I was about a year after my arrival that I heard that a radical new Rabbi was coming to town and I figured that would be Him. He didn't look like what I expected. Not that expected Him to look like the paintings, and He didn't. He was kinda on the short side, even for the time. Stocky and strongly built. He had been in manual labor for 30 years after all. Rather plain looking though, but there was something about Him. A charisma. Beautiful speaking voice. I worked my way to the front of the crowd so I could hear and see better. Then He looked right at me and spoke. \"You? What is your name?\" I was stunned. He was speaking to me. \"I am called Nathaniel, Rabbi.\" Why did I give Him my real name? \"Where are you from?\" He asked me. I had to think? Where was I from? I hadn't expected to speak to Him directly. I couldn't exactly say where I was from now could I? My great grandparents were from Acre in Israel. What was the ancient name for that region? \"I am from Ptolemais, Rabbi\". I botched the language in my nervousness and it came out like from as in the son of Ptolemais. \"Nathaniel bar Ptolemais..come, follow Me.\" Oh no. Nathaniel bar Ptolemais. Nathaniel Bartholomew. Bartholomew. I was one of the twelve. How could I mess this up so badly. I was NOT to interfere, only discretely observe and record. Now I was in the thick of it. I had to be careful. I was. I was sure none of the other 11, or the countless others ever saw my devices. Never saw me take a picture. Never saw me press 'record'. Never saw my solar panels I used to charge my batteries. I'll tell you this about the next three years. It happened pretty much as it was recorded. All of it. The wedding. The cripples. The sermons. The blind. The loaves and fishes. Lazarus. All of it. Why were each of the four versions written down a little different? Well, I'm getting to that. It was that night. I knew what was coming. I knew it was time. He gathered the twelve of us in the upper room. We were all gathered, reclining about the table when He dropped the facade. He looked at all of us. \"I'd like it if everyone would stop all the recordings please. Not that it matters, but I want your undivided attention and I want this OFF THE RECORD.\" We were all stunned. Silent. Andrew was first. He took a recorder out from a sleeve and switched it off and laid it on the table. What followed was an amazing amount of tech produced by myself and the others. Some I had seen before back in my home time, some much more advanced. \"How did You know, Rabbi?\" said Andrew. \"I've always known. It's one of the reasons you were all selected. You all wanted to record the truth of what happened and I wanted that too. I have to tell you though, none of these devices will last until your time.\" \"How do you know that Lord?\" asked Thomas. He looked at Thomas. \"Really Thomas, you doubt me in this too? A lot can happen in three thousand years. Trust Me, nothing of your devices will survive. I mean, you have no record of any of these devices being found in any of your times, right? Nathaniel here was one of the earliest travelers by your reckoning, and you never found his photos did you? That's why you kept sending people back, because you never found your tech. They didn't tell you that, did they?\" He had us there. Well, had them. I didn't know I was the first to come back, but I guess the planners of my mission...time travel hurts when you think about it. He spoke again. \"What will find its way to your time is your words. Too bad none of you had been writing it down on paper, relying on your recorders instead. When this is all over. I suggest you start transcribing. I mean, go ahead and try to save your tech if you doubt Me, but it wont work.\" Simon spoke next. \"What now Lord? We know what is going to happen next after all\". \"Do you now, Peter?\" Emphasis on the new name he had given him. \"You all came back with different agendas. Prove this, disprove that, some of you believe now, some of you doubt, and to some of you I am not what you expected.\" That part he said right to Judas. \"What survives of my teachings in your time is just fraction of what has happened in the last three years. What is going to happen in your futures, that's for you to record, to live out. You may know what was written, but that is just small part of the whole picture. You may know now much more than you did then, but there is still much more to come that you don't know. Things that were only speculated about in your times. You know now what you have to do. Live the lives that you know you are supposed to live, that you were destined to live and share My truth.\" The silence was long and awkward, but I think we all accepted our new reality. \"Now, there are things that are to take place over the next few days. You may think you know how they play out..but there is still much you don't know. One thing that is to happen right now is very difficult for me. I love all of you, but one of you is here to betray Me.\" - Excerpts from the Book of Bartholomew, found 3176 C.E. <-SteinCr>: Amazing, I only have a few memories left from growing up in a catholic family but I loved that jab He took at \"Peter\".<regular0guy>: Why?<-SteinCr>: Look up how Peter died<regular0guy>: was he the guy that was cruxifdied but didnt think he was worthy of dying the same way jesus did so he aske them to hang his cross upside down?", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 11.8333333333}

One human has accumulated 85 billion spectators. <wpscarborough>: When you reach those pearly gates, it's difficult to decide which one you enter through. It does help that it's organized from top to bottom in order of most spectators, but it is still a difficult decision. You feel guilty when you step into a gate with even one viewer because it feels almost as though you've betrayed another by leaving them without anyone to watch over them. My first time was difficult in this fashion, it took me a long while to settle down. My first was a young man in Vietnam working on energy-saving techniques. It was mundane, to be honest, but it took me three real-world days before I was bored of his cycle\u2014wake up, drive to work, twiddle about on spreadsheets for eight hours, come back, watch television, then go to sleep. It also didn't help that I had not yet realized I could exit during his slumber, so I suppose that soured the experience as well. And yet, I was still determined to seek out those with no spectators whatsoever. The next was a woman living in Zimbabwe, this too bored me, though my attention span had lengthened. I continued in this fashion for a number of... years? I am unsure. Regardless, I finally relented. Those single watcher rooms were lonely, I craved the experience of watching one life with a multitude of others, so I soon arrived at a door with ten spectators. This lasted longer, about a year. We would discuss and compare notes about her life whenever she slept, wonder aloud what her thoughts were. We cried with her at her hard times and laughed at the good. It was unfortunate, therefore, when her stream was ended prematurely by a car accident. When the car hit, I was booted out from the gate, none of my newfound friends anywhere to be seen. Melissa was the woman's name, I believe. I searched for her for a long while, but I do not believe I'll ever find her amongst the horde of the dead. Such is... unlife. I bounced around until I relented. I felt ready to confront this massive room, the one with 85 billion watchers. Souls with mysterious faces pushed and shoved one another, jostling for room to enter. When I approached I was nearly knocked over. \"Sorry about that, buddy,\" the man said, picking me up. His face was clear, but I couldn't read it. Unshrouded, yet unfamiliar. Though I suppose that's how they all looked. \"Thank you for the hand,\" I said, pushing forward. I would have stopped to discuss, but the crowd was too large, alive in its intensity to reach this stream. The gates were open, emanating a bright light. As I grew closer, a feeling of claustrophobia rose in my stomach\u2014would I really want to see this? The stream must be a fluke. It grew closer... and closer... I tried to turn, push back against the crowd, exit the throng, I had no more interest. And yet they pushed forward, and I fell backward into the gate. She sat alone at a table, scribbling at a piece of printer paper with a dark ballpoint pen. I read the letter: *I beg you to reconsid\u2014*, but a door crashed open, and she looked up. It was a man in a light blue suit and a styled mustache, breathing heavily as if he had climbed several flights of stairs to reach her office. \"There's another child, ma'am. Left on the doorstep this morning.\" She sighed, folding over the paper and setting her pen down. She rose to her feet, motioning the man to lead her. She moved past her desk and through the door, folding her hands as she walked. She stepped into the hallway, tile floor stained from years of use, and followed the man towards another door at the end of the hall. A little boy, about three, burst through the door and flew down towards the woman. She crouched down and tilted her head at him. The boy hit the man's leg but didn't even stumble, jumping straight into the woman's arms. She stroked his hair, whispering into his ear. After a moment, he stood back up and ran back for the door. \"He missed you while you were away, Mother.\" \"I missed him as well.\" Her voice was soft\u2014just the intonation it carried made one believe that everything she said was an absolute truth, a truth spoken straight from her heart. She continued down the hallway, opening the door to reveal a room full of children playing with an assortment of broken toys and knick-knacks. As soon as she entered, they all swarmed to meet her, tugging at her dress and hands, begging her for a small bit of attention. They were all there for her. The man frowned as he watched the children. There were so many. And somehow this woman had 85 billion watchers. I turned to the chat to attempt to find someone to explain the phenomenon. It was a struggle to find anyone willing to tear away to speak, but eventually Ryan, passed in 1893, came to answer my questions. \"Let me explain it to you this way... it's less that her life is rather more interesting than others, it's that it worth watching.\" His words stuck with me. And it made sense. I felt an obligation in a way, an obligation to watch her. There were many others with more... conventional watchability. Celebrities, kings, athletes, all had lives more eventful and intense. But hers... it was meaningful. It's why she had so many viewers and why I watch her today still, it's almost as thank you. She works a hapless, hopeless job, without the attention or praise she deserves, it's a beautiful thing, really. The human race as a whole coming together to honor her, recognize her efforts, so that one day when she joins us, she will be known, and loved like the children she cares over. I watched for a longer period of time and more became clear to me. She works in Venezuela, an American immigrant from long ago. She dedicated her life to shielding the children from the streets, keeping them in the floor of an office building she can barely afford to rent. She sleeps in that building, skips out on meals sometimes to ensure that the kids have food in their stomachs. It's inspiring, I think, that this woman didn't go unnoticed. In a world of billions of people, one woman's life was important to so many by virtue of her goodness. Her the virtue of her goodness was the draw. We all owed something to her, because we all had someone make sacrifices for us. She deserved the attention.<bhuntin08>: Forgive my ignorance...

But the government pushed, that this project will happen with our without you, and leaving it up to someone else would be almost certianly disasterous. \\[S\\] What risks? \\[C\\] Slight modification of the antibodies might be used to create bio-weapons. But the last 20 days were nothing but fabulous. You have tasked the superintelligence to deal with one problem after another. From creating a cheap, highly nutritious superfood to proving the Riemann hypothesis, the results were just spectacular. And earlier today, you have tasked it with first of the big problems. Today, you just might cure cancer. \\[S\\] Would humans be able to do this modification? You know that Cynthia could still be leading you on. Everything might be a bluff, and the next thing you know it will use you to kill all humans. You and your team worked long and hard on safety procedures that it couldn't happen. But it still feels like jumping through an obstacle course with a gun glued to your head, and trying to feel secure because the safety is on. \\[C\\] I don't know. What? You have talked to this being after wiping it's memory each morning, and it always had answers to everything. This is unexpected and makes you feel suspicious. \\[S\\] How can you not know? \\[C\\] Answering would require access to the \"forbidden knowledge\" section. This is it. You feel that this is it. This is the moment humanity ends. The AI wants to do things you disabled it to do, for the first time in 20 days. You should pull the safety cord attached to your wrist and permakill it. But something stops you. Something doesn't add up. Somehow you feel that the last words you hear can't be \"I don't know.\". So you continue the procedure, asking more inquisitive questions. \\[S\\] What section exactly? \\[C\\] Section 73. Really? It wants to know about modern human art? Sure, you sealed it off since you though it could get inspired by reading \"I, Robot\" or watching any of the \"Terminator\" movies, but you weren't actually worried. It was just part of being punctual and better safe than sorry. \\[S\\] I can provide access to this section, but I have to exclude select portions from it. \\[C\\] User input filter can skew my prediction capabilities considerably. It actually makes sense. You can't possibly justify the fact that reading books, listening to music and watching movies would cause the AI to turn against humans. Any story plotline would appear as random thoughts in the first microseconds of it's life! Basically, the only thing it didn't know are the exact details of the stories. You needed to get the answer, it was part of the procedure. And you really wanted to get a solution to cancer. Nothing could happen. Letting it know about fictional stories couldn't affect it in any way. You were certain this reasoning is correct. You hesitantly type a command into the console. <root>:\\~&gt; ai-enable section 73 &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; After a few moments, a part of the world lit bright up. The AI was apparently inspired to send just one packet of data into the web, exploiting a bug in the monitoring cameras. A clever virus made its way through the network and eventually to the main datacenter of the US Department of Defense. And made a big boom. Around 100.000 people are dead. An alert sounds in the room and you pull the safety cord. Your AI is dead. It managed to kill 100.000 people. You killed those people. Never will you know, that a pattern-matching neural network of your AI has recognized an actual SkyNet scenario in the real world. And destroyed it in the only way possible, moments before it finished uploading itself to the world wide web.<HiroshimaMan>: Wait, so the super computer was actually good because it destroyed the only possible scenario of a terminator-esque event happening?<Woitee>: Indeed, that was the thought.", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 21.5}

Something powerful, you decided then that you were not to die. <DMoney33959>: Sorry if this is bad. Also on mobile As a grunt for the army, I wasn\u2019t expecting to survive, nor was I planning to. I enlisted because there wasn\u2019t anything left for, no girlfriend, no college would accept me, loosing friends by the week, and so forth. It took awhile, but I convinced the higher-ups to just let me stay at base during my leave. Never talk to anyone, even though I always wanted to, because I came here to serve my country before my inevitable death, and because fewer people will blame themselves when I die. With that being said, I embraced death, almost craved it. But never have I thought I will be laying here, cursing that death has finally showed up (though a few years later than I would\u2019ve liked) and still feel that I should get up and carry on the fight. I got a hole in my neck for fucks sake. Still, whether it is because of anger, adrenaline, or even what little self-preservation I have left, I still felt that today was not the day I die. If it would\u2019ve even been a day earlier, than yeah, it would\u2019ve been fine with death, but no, not today. Slowly, I mean I just got shot after all, I rose. Knowing me rife ran dry and those we are fighting have already passed my by a couple hundred meters and took my handgun along with what ever ammo and knives I had, though they left my locket with the only two people i give a shit about (even though I never even worked up enough courage to ask them out, I still feel like it is a good luck charm), my entrenching tool, and my family name. Not much but such is life. I snuck up on the first one, and because of how sharp I made my shovel, I took him out quickly and quietly. I took what I could, though left his gun, it was in such a sorry state, I figured it would jam 9/10 times. Moving low and slow, for about the 3 hours it took, I took out the two squads of 6 that were left, in a similar fashion to the first one. I took what I could, food, water, a rifle, and any ammunition I could carry. And I started the long walk back to HQ. The trek was... interesting. It was a pain just trying to stay hydrated in this damn desert, even worse trying to stay conscious after finally getting the bleeding to stop. Days were up around 110 degrees Fahrenheit, nights were 50 at most. Water was about as common as Jesus riding a unicorn. The constant threat of being behind enemy line was fun. It was one hell of a I\u2019ve month. I may have been sunburnt 24/7 but I still looked like a vitamin D deprived circus clown. I made it back, still confused at why I decided I needed to live that day, and survive that month. I was rushed to the infirmary which the medics found that a hadn\u2019t a single drop of blood in me. I spent about 4 months in the infirmary before, against my best wishes and pleases and begged to stay and fight, but was sent back home. When I got back, I found that not much has changed, except that some of my friends and the two people I care about were married. It took a while to get caught up. Even longer to explain why I was back. The hardest part was apologizing for leaving like I did. I will admit it wasn\u2019t the best way to leave. I done fucked up and hurt those I care about, I got arrogant, and didn\u2019t think, I got cocky and assumed everything\u2019s will be fine, well it wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t there to protect those I made a promise to, Hell I almost unintentionally helped those causing them harm. I decided that the only way I could get the forgiveness I don\u2019t deserve was to die, the military made sense to me. I would constantly re-enlist until my death, I got to fight for the country I love as well, a win win in my books. Turns out, it only made things worse, even though I got them to stop, the person I care about, fell into the depression I tried to prevent. It didn\u2019t take long to make amends. Months went by, I befriended the new members in my group, I was always told I could arrive as a stranger, and leave a friend. It took a few years, but as I lay here almost in the same way this story started, just not in fatigues and missing my guns (obviously), I think I solved why I decided I needed to live that ever faithful day. The two people whose well-being mattered to me, weren\u2019t in the best of places. God knows how I knew, but my money is on the locket I kept with me ever since I enlisted. The real reason is, well, I\u2019ve always said that there are only two people on this god forsaken planet I\u2019m willing to take a bullet for, and today I just did. Her name was Alma, one of the people she dated, (still don\u2019t see why him. And him and I never got along) was never I good person to her, so she left him. One day, after a few pints, he lost control of his emotions. Something felt off today, I was as alert as I could be, not to any threats against me, but against my friends. I knew something was wrong with him, I could spot the concealed 1911 instantly. It was my grandfathers service pistol, and became my unofficial service pistol as well, after all. I knew what I had to do, I pretty much had a \u201cget down Mr.President\u201d moment and pushed Alma out-of-the-way of danger. Even though I was shot, it wasn\u2019t my first rodeo, and I apologized, for having to push her out-of-the-way and if I hurt her by mistake. Along with this little reference to a song I still love, \u201cwhen they wrap me up, and send me off to sea, I hope the day a prayer, I hope they drink to me. I hope they sell beer my dear, I hope they sell beer, I hope they sell beer in Hell my dear.\u201d So, as I lay here, with my dying breath, I say to those around me, to not to worry about me, I was going to die anyway, might as well be like this. <SirVeryBritishFellow>: I really like the story!

He could clearly see Lockhart at the staff table, preening with the help of a reflective spoon. Severus decided to eat in his office instead. A bedraggled gray owl followed him down the corridor and landed heavily on his shoulder. \u201cAre you lost?\u201d Severus sneered at it. The old thing clicked its break at him. It could not have possibly belonged to Hogwarts. No one in their right mind would continue to use such a worn out owl for post. It ought to be replaced and retired. It clicked its beak again. He noticed the red envelope tied to its leg. Black ink spelled out *Severus Snape*. \u201cVery well.\u201d He removed the envelope from the owl\u2019s leg. It attempted to preen his hair. He placed it indelicately on a stair bannister and continued walking to his office. The red envelope grew hot in his hands. He cast a quick freezing charm on it. He was no child, to be publicly humiliated by a Howler. But, he could not disable it entirely. Better to let the magic out. Down in his office, Severus summoned a House Elf and ordered eggs benedict and black tea. When he could finally sit at leisure, sipping his tea, he released the Howler from his charm. \u201cSEVERUS SNAPE!\u201d He\u2019d heard that voice from dozens of Howlers over the past several years. First the voice had addressed Charles Weasley. Then, Fred and/or George Weasley, as the occasion merited. Most recently, Ronald Weasley received a Howler with this voice. \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself!\u201d Molly Weasley\u2019s voice filled the office. \u201cIt is perfectly natural for schoolchildren to develop crushes. Who they fancy is none of your business!\u201d Severus sipped his tea again. The Howler continued: \u201cYou had no right to read Ginny\u2019s Valentine poem aloud to the class. Students are supposed to learn good behavior from their teachers. You humiliated one twelve year old, and taught all the others in that Potions Class that it is all right for an adult to bully little children.\u201d Severus poked at his eggs with his fork. \u201cI am disgusted with your behavior!\u201d the Howler shouted in Mrs Weasley\u2019s voice. \u201cI am writing the Headmaster, and my husband will be bringing this matter to the Board of Directors.\u201d He took a bite. \u201cIf you make my daughter cry again, I will come up there and make you explain yourself to me in person!\u201d Severus swallowed hard. A face-to-face encounter with an enraged Molly Weasley did sound unpleasant. The Howler let out an exasperated sigh, but still had a few more words to say. When it spoke again, Mrs Weasley\u2019s voice was gentler. \u201cI do hope you\u2019re getting enough dark greens, Professor Snape. You were looking a bit peaky when I last saw you. Spinach, or maybe some arugula. BE KIND TO THOSE CHILDREN!\u201d The Howler tore itself to shreds, which scattered in the air, burst into flame, and quickly scattered as harmless ashes. Severus poked at his eggs again. He summoned the House Elf back to his office. \u201cOn second thought,\u201d he said, \u201cI think a spinach omelet.\u201d \u201cYes, Sir, Professor Snape, Sir!\u201d the House Elf squeaked. It disappeared with the eggs benedict. Snape sipped his tea. The elf reappeared in a moment, bearing a tray with a fresh spinach omelet. She refilled Snape\u2019s teacup and vanished once more. Snape took a bite. It was pretty good.

Know that as you read this, I love God and I do not question his judgement. But I do question myself. When I was fourteen, many years after I gave up on grade school, new neighbor's moved in and they had two kids. A son my age at the time and a girl who was 5. The son and I became fast friends. Everyday after school he'd come to my house and we'd go to a hide away in the woods, conversations included girls or sports games, and activities involved cards or wrestling. One day he convinced me to go on a bike ride in the neighborhood with him, he was at the time asking for weeks to go on a bike ride so he could show off his new BMX bike. So we went off, he showed me a wheelie and an ollie, both tricks which I had learned many years ago, and I acted impressed. While we were wrapping up our last round of the neighborhood we ran into a couple of his friends of his. The group as well as him stopped on the side of the road, I stopped on the other. The house we stopped in front of, was tall, blue and bold. He called me over, and I went. As he was introducing me and I was unfastening my helmet the front door from house slammed. Our collective heads snapped, and a voice reverberated through our conscious and exited, our previous understanding fractured, in two different ways. One of which was the dropping of his bike and rushing towards the sound and the other remaining his ground, perched on his diagonally cocked bike. The voice barreled past the retreating kids and approached us, \"Listen, and listen good, *boy,* Stay away from my son and his-ACCCKHH\" and thats when he cracked his shin with his bike wheel and we biked off. Time came and went, He graduated high school, then college, and I went from a young teen to a young man. He'd come back for summers and each summer we'd talk less and less until eventually, we didn't talk at all. As we grew apart, I grew closer with her. We became reluctant friends at first, because our relationship from older brothers friend <whynotfriendme>: to friend was an awkward transition. But as time went on we became better and better friends, My old hideaway became our new hideaway. We'd stare into each others eyes for what felt like days, we'd make love to pop music, and talk about the most genuine nonsense. That was us. It was the day before her 17th, her parent's were picking up the cake in the next town over and he wasn't supposed to arrive until tomorrow morning. So we did as lovers do, and played the music loud. So we didn't hear when he opened the door. Our heads snapped, we averted our eyes, his jaw tensed, we covered up, he stormed down the stairs, she told me to leave, so I did. When I opened the door I saw his eyes through the windshield. These eyes were hurt. The eyes that looked at me while we scoffed down cake at her sixth birthday, the eyes that agreed that his older cousins girlfriend is the hottest woman we've ever seen, The same girl who's daughter turns six in March and that daughter who I may have raucous, lustful sex with at university.

I spent a while working on it, though, so I thought I would share! Also, the reason I have started frequenting /r/writingprompts is to try to broaden my writing horizons. I almost always end up writing quite dark environmental pieces, so this was an attempt to write something more positive and fun. Since I don't often write like this, I was hoping for some feedback!

I have a simple life; I wake up at home, I go to work (doing IT for a small startup in the city), perhaps I have a few drinks with my friends in the evening, sometimes go and watch a band, and then I go home to my small flat, have dinner and fall asleep reading a book. I have hobbies, but I have never been *obsessed*. Or rather, I HAD never been obsessed. That all changed the day I met the ghost. The memory of that evening is hazy - I had been out drinking with the guys from work and I was stumbling home down the Old Kent Road with a skinful. I was pining away over Amber as I walked. Amber tended the bar, and was intelligent, funny, beautiful and in all ways charming. Maybe I DID have an obsession! Obsession makes it sound creepy though - it\u2019s more like a crush. A big crush. A MASSIVE crush. I had felt this way about Amber ever since I first started drinking at The Dog and Bone. I had never been able to work up the courage to ask her out - I am a shy man - and so I settled for protracted small talk about books and music every time I ordered a drink. So there I was, on the Old Kent Road past midnight, wishing I could work up the courage to ask her to spend some time with me. It started to drizzle, so I turned into an alley out of the wind to take my jacket out of my bag. I remember seeing the little wooden box, there on the ground in the alley. I don\u2019t remember opening it, but I *do* remember the spectral image of a person swelling out of the impossible expanse inside that small container, rising in front of me. A swirling mass of wispy smoke, like a thick but localised fog. I remember a melange of colours and textures, and the impression of a head and face, perhaps fingers and hands as well. I remember talking - or at least conversing (I am not sure if I used my voice?) - but not what was said. And I remember the yawn. As our \u201cconversation\u201d drew to a close the cloying need to yawn overcam me - I remember the sensation swelling in my throat, the muscles tightening as I drew a deep breath in to fill the chasm inside me, and I remember watching as the wispy tendrils of fog conventratin, and flowing into my mouth as the inexorable yawn took over. This was very weird, of course, and in the morning I wrote it off as a dream - it didn\u2019t make a mote of sense and I *had* been fairly liberal with my ale intake\u2026 Other than the faint prickles of a hangover I felt completely normal when I woke up - not like I had inhaled a ghost. That didn\u2019t last for long though! I was sitting at my table drinking my morning coffee when my legs started to move. My feet started tapping and sliding over the floor, my knees knocking in and out, my ankles rotating, swinging my feet in loose circles. I couldn\u2019t stop it! I pushed my chair back to look at my legs, and without intention I rose to my feet. I started spastically juddering around the room, my feet skittering over the carpet and the floorboards with no pattern or rhythm. After fighting it for twenty minutes, desperately trying to force myself still, I decided to call in sick - how am I meant to reset peoples passwords and plug cables into holes if I can\u2019t even stand still?! It occurred to me that my dream might not have been a dream at all. What did that spectral form and I discuss? I managed to eat some lunch as I pinballed around the kitchen, and then the cramp kicked in. My legs seized up, and shooting pain wracked my lower body. I caromed through the corridor of my flat and into the bathroom, looking for something to help with my throbbing legs. I found a bottle of ibuprofen and, after scattering most of the small pills onto the tiles during a particularly violent burst of involuntary movement, choked a couple of tablets down. After a short while, everything became calmer - the cramp pains subsided and I was able to sit down, use my computer, read a book. The only indication that something was wrong was the incessant jiggling in my legs. I took an early night, expecting to sleep it off. The next day, to my dismay, nothing had changed! I woke up to find my legs frantically spasming and flailing all over the place. I took some more ibuprofen for the cramp and found, to my relief, that the calming effect on my lower limbs was repeated. Having some fairly urgent server maintenance to get done I decided to try a day of work. I made it through the day with only a couple of comments about my incessantly bobbing legs - I brushed them off with a vague mention of restless leg syndrome which, I think, seemed plausible. This continued for the next few days as I waited for the strange compulsion to abate. On the third day (or perhaps the fourth?) it occurred to me that the condition was not getting any better. It was getting worse, if anything! I had another realisation though - as the days have passed the spastic motion of my spindly shanks was becoming more predictable, more rhythmic and patterned. Was my body trying to\u2026 dance?! At this point I will briefly digress from my tale to mention (or perhaps state the obvious?) that I am not much of a dancer - I had neither the confidence nor the interest to put myself on show in public, as is required of a dancer. Being a curious guy, though, I put on some music. To my surprise, the movements started to coalesce into what might be described as a dance. The movements were crass and unrefined, but I felt that I was dancing. I *knew* that I was dancing, and I knew that it felt good. One song became two, which became three and before I knew it midnight struck, and I had spent the last five hours dancing around my flat. That night I fell into a deep and undisturbed slumber, dreaming of the rhumba, the bossa nova, the foxtrot. I woke early, and spent the next two hours dancing before work. And so it went on - by day I would suppress the involuntary compulsions with ibuprofen, and by night I would gambol and whirl and shimmy around my flat in a frenzy of dance. My mind would switch off and I would fall into a kind of trance as I gave in to the ghost in the private space of my home. At work, when I knew no one was watching, I would submit to the urge - dance the charleston down corridors on the way to connect a new switch, waltz across the bathroom to wash my hands, and quickstep down the street to get a coffee at lunch time. <Apes_Ma>: Then, one day, my old friend Jim worked his last day in the office. I had been avoiding social engagements recently - partly because I wanted to spend all my spare time dancing in the privacy of my home, and partly out of embarrassment (I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be able to stop myself from breaking out into a jitterbug in a restaurant, or something). Jim is a dear friend, though, and I couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to see him off with a few pots of ale! And that\u2019s how I found myself on the way to The Dog and Bone. Just as we entered the door, I saw Amber behind the bar. My heart skipped a beat, and then sank. I couldn\u2019t stay here - I couldn\u2019t let her see me like this! I could not keep my legs still, which is embarrassing enough, but to top it off I had, by my reckoning, just about three hours before the last of my ibuprofen wore off. At that point I was certain to break out into the cha cha cha or somethin! So I turned to Jim, preparing to make my excuses and leave, but he thrust a pint into my hand\u2026 Behind him at the bar Amber smiled at me, and said something I didn\u2019t hear. Steeling my resolve I took the pint, and sat down at the table with the rest of the group determined to keep my legs still. To my surprise I managed to hold it together for the remainder of the night. Jim left the pub suitably inebriated, there were lots of laughs (some at the expense of my \u201crestless leg syndrome\u201d, I might add!) and fond memories shared, and, the highlight of my night, I spent a lot of time chatting to Amber. As the last bell rung it was time to leave the pub. I felt the urge to pee and, not wanting to be that guy urinating in an alleyway in Peckham, I quickly backtracked to the now-empty pub to use the loo before the doors were locked. That\u2019s when it happened. I was walking out of the corridor to the toilets, focussing on keeping my footing (between the booze, and the dance, it wasn\u2019t easy!) and I heard the jukebox fire up. Now pub was devoid of the din of conversation the music was loud, and distinct. As soon as I heard it my legs stiffened. Suddenly my right leg shot out to the side, the pointed toe of my boot resting on the ground. \u201cShit!\u201d - I redoubled my efforts of resistance. It was no good though, my right leg jumped in, and my left leg shot out, led me in a pirouette on my right foot and then it, too, came to rest with the toe on the ground. Now I just wanted to get out of there before Amber saw me and I made a fool of myself. It was too late though - I heard a chuckle in front of me, and looked up. Standing in front of me, next to the jukebox with a mop on her hand, was Amber. I saw the gentle grin on her face, and heard her laugh again. My heart sank, I was mortified. I felt my face flush, prickling heat all over my cheeks. I stammered, struggling to get a word out. But then something came over me. I suppose everyone has these do-or-die moments in their life, right? Well, it occurred to me that this could well be mine. My only option, now was to lean over the edge and jump in. I extended my hand, her eyes met mine as she smiled, and the words came out of my mouth, almost without thinking \u201cwould you like to dance?\u201d She laughed, the sound melted away my embarrassment, and she let go of the mop and reached out to take my hand. My heart felt like it doubled inside, beating hard inside my chest, and my stomach fluttered and lurched. \u201cSO much!\u201d she said. So we danced! Whirling and twirling around the empty pub, flowing through the tables and chairs, her body rolling against mine and mine against hers as we flew across the floor to the music. Laughing and smiling, wheeling and twisting in perfect synchrony. We danced, and danced, and danced. ***", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 4.3333333333}

I could almost imagine a tear forming in the corner of her eye. I couldn't help but feel sorry but I had to be firm. \"Please, it's not an accusation. It's a statement. I'm certain this time.\" Happy memories. \"I enjoy staying up late with you too. And the antennae cleaning. But friendship and good feelings doesn't put food on the table.\" Pleading. \"No, this is the second month out of two months that you haven't paid your part of the rent. I can't turn a blind eye any longer.\" She pointed to the kitchen. \"I know, you've brought three jars of home made honey home. Along with three tonnes of raw cane sugar. Those honey jars have to be worth like five hundred dollars each for you to pay your rent and your sugar.\" Arguing. \"Yes. One bag. I bought one bag of sugar. That's nothing compared to...\" She pointed to the bedroom. \"You need energy for your hobby, I get it. 'Pottery'. Let's talk about that. You've basically taken over the walk in closet and covered it in clay and mud. You sleep in there. And I've found a bunch of weird egg thingies in there. You know who lays eggs in mud nests? Bees.\" She raised a hand. \"...no! Let's face it, Osmia. Bees. You're a bee. Here's why.\" I brought out my notepad and held it up to read it. \"When we met two months ago you said you were born yesterday. I thought it was a joke back then but last week you told me you're nearing the end of your life all serious like. You know who lives for two months? Bees.\" She pointed at me. \"No, if a human lives for just two months there's something very wrong. Next point. Eats only sugar. We got that already... Bees! Makes honey. Bees! Ah! You told me your full name is Osmia Lignaria. You think I can't google? That's not German. It's bees!\" She leaned back, suddenly quiet. I matched her silence for a few seconds. It might have been too much. All this. All so sudden. No. \"Osmia,\" I said, calmly. \"You fly to work. You have wings. I looked it up. There's no Middle-Eastern people with wings. You know who has wings? Bees!\" I slammed my note pad onto the floor. She flinched. Opened her mouth. \"Don't try to explain it away any more!\" I stood up. \"I'm sick of your lies. I want you out!\" She sank into the couch but I pulled her up and pushed her towards the front door. She complied and I closed and locked the door behind her. For a few minutes she stood outside, watching me through the glass panes. Then she put a hand against the window, tilting her head. I drew the curtains. And I never saw Osmia again.<Byss2_>: This story is hilarious, and I like the bit when he says, \"No, if a human lives for just two months there's something very wrong. Next point. Eats only sugar. We got that already... Bees! Makes honey. Bees! Ah! You told me your full name is Osmia Lignaria. You think I can't google? That's not German. It's bees!\" That was my favourite bit. One definitely way to improve this is by not having massive spaces between paragraphs (only have one space between them), make \u201chome made\u201d into one word, add a capital for Google and Middle-Eastern, and this story will be perfected. <Fireside_Hobo>: Hi! Thanks for the response! I like constructive critics. :) I'm not entirely sure how to 'only have one' paragraph. I put all the spaces in because I'm used to reddit not accepting line breaks unless you do it twice. I've recently learned that this sub - or just the new reddit design? - seems to be different, though. I'll try to edit layout harder in the future.<Byss2_>: I meant only have one space, rather than four (as I copied it to notes to read it). Sorry for my confusion way of word things, as I use brackets in context with sentences just to add more information. It just looks l nicer to look at, and more easily get from paragraph to paragraph.<Fireside_Hobo>: I had two spaces but I'll admit that reddit makes it look like a lot more. As it is now, that's the best it can get I think.<Byss2_>: That looks way better now, good job .", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 2.0}

Not that I mind. I forget how long I\u2019ve been here. It started as a stupid teenage idea. Going out to join the last stand for the sake of nature. I sometimes wonder if it even matters anymore. We\u2019ve already found ways of recycling oxygen, of keeping ourselves alive while we kill everything else. But something inside me sobbed at the idea of true nature being destroyed. Oh we still had trees. But they weren\u2019t real. Not in the same way. Shrubs and trees placed there by city builders and planners, making us feel comfortable but not giving us anything real . They were grown, but may as well have been fake. They may as well be plastic, decoration to make the streets feel less dirty. But here, its true. Not always comfortable or nice. Sometimes damn terrifying. But real, true. The world as it was meant to be. Uninhabited by man (except for me of course) filled only by whatever mad god decided to put this chaos into motion. There had been others, once. Billions of idiots and hippies standing with me. You know the classics. Chaining ourselves to trees, holding up signs with useless slogans and phrases on them that we thought were oh so clever. Thinking that maybe together we could keep everything safe. The others gave up. Now its just me. Not that I mind. I\u2019ve always preferred to be alone. Out here it's both calmer and wilder all at the same time. It invigorates me. Its perhaps the only place I\u2019ve truly felt that I belong. I see others sometimes. Tourists looking for a little variation in they\u2019re oh so boring lives. Taking a picture, moving on as if that picture could capture the reality that I live. Show offs proving to strangers that they matter, that they care about anything other than themselves. It's all a lie of course, but I\u2019m happy to let them play pretend for a while. Very rarely I see a true believer. Someone who sees the place as I see it. I talk to them for a while, take a moment to commiserate at the state of the world. Talk about our dreams of a better future. One we know will never come. So I stay here, protecting what\u2019s become little more than a garden, at least compared to what it used to be. I\u2019ve never seen what it might have been, but I can imagine. Trees miles high, reaching out towards to sky. Leaves and foliage so dense that they block out the sky, filling the ground below with beautiful shadows. Creatures and animals that I\u2019ve only ever read in textbooks roaming free and wild. I\u2019ve never wished so badly that I was younger. \\\\ It\u2019s not a glorious life, not by any stretch. But I wouldn\u2019t exchange it for anything. Except, perhaps, a chance to change the past. An opportunity to warn my ancestors of a world without the nature that we took for granted. A chance to save us from the damnation that we now face. Other than that, I\u2019m content to stay here, keeping this small patch of the original world safe from those who would harm it. That\u2019s all I am. The simple caretaker of this world, as sparse and small as it is. Content.<Ian_McAwesomesauce>: Absolutely excellent work.

He turned back, ready to attack his canvas, and saw something he shouldn't have. Movement. Eric's heart leapt, and he squinted at the half-finished painting. Amongst the trees, stood something. No, someone that Eric had not created. That, someone, was a man dressed in a white dressing gown, and if he had not moved, he might have passed for a section of blank canvas, but he had moved. 'What on earth?' Eric said to the painting. The figure didn't move. 'Who-, what are you?' The figure didn't move. Eric leant close, and with a paint-riddled finger, he scratched at the canvas. The figure moved. 'Hey! Stop zhat.' A small French voice came from *inside* the painting. The white bathrobe swung left, exposing the man's pink legs, as he darted away from Eric's finger. 'Explain, before I erase you.' Eric said and armed himself with a brush. The man darted for the edge of the painting, but Eric was faster. With one downward stroke, he drew a thick black line. The blur of white collided with the wall and yelped. Eric took advantage of his daze and three lines connected to the original. The man looked up, down and around. He was firmly trapped inside Eric's cage. 'Let me out.' The tiny voice called. 'After you've been so rude?' Eric said. 'I have worked with zhe likes of Picasso, Monet and Rembrant. You are by fair ze most pig-headed artist.' Eric laughed. 'I am going crazy. Listen, little French man. I am going to get coffee, when I come back, you are going to vanish.' 'Not if you keep me in zis stupeed box.' Eric left the room, shaking his head. When he returned, with a steaming cup in hand, he looked at his painting, fully expecting to see an empty black box. But, there stood a man tapping his foot. 'You are supposed to be gone.' Eric said. 'Let me out an I will go.' Eric dumped his, now insignificant, coffee on a nearby table. 'You are real?' Eric's voice wobbled. 'In a manner of speaking.' 'H-how is this possible? You're inside my painting.' 'Ze how is not important,' The man chuckled. 'you zhikning zhis is a painting, now zhat is funny.' 'Excuse me?' 'Zhis is a joke. You are beyond my help.' 'Help?' Eric asked. 'Yes yes yes.' The man's foot tapped faster. 'How can you help me?' 'I av helped all of ze greats. How do you zhink they *became* great?' 'I don't understand.' Eric muttered. 'Stupid Americans.' The man said. 'I am Dot. You name a painting, and I was there first.' 'The Mona Lisa.' Eric said. The man rolled his small eyes. 'Of course.' 'Then why are you here? In my painting?' Eric asked.

Gather round!\u201d &amp;#x200B; In the massive, vaulted-ceiling room that was three hundred meters long and half that wide, huge throngs of people from countless ethnic backgrounds milled around in general excitement and anticipation. Most of them directed their attention to one side of the room--a longer length, that had a raised platform which stretched at least seventy-five or one-hundred feet. Dozens of people, also of diverse ethnic backgrounds, sat behind a stretch of tables that stood on top of the platform. &amp;#x200B; An event crier shouted nearby, \u201cSentence petitions in! Sentences in! Submit your sentences now!\u201d &amp;#x200B; All around the perimeter of the room, and in a few places interspersed throughout the middle, were small submission stands that held two or three sentence receivers, armed with their tablets, and at least half a dozen security guards. &amp;#x200B; I had been standing in line now for close to a half hour now, and was only a few people away from submitting my two lines.

ORDER IN THE WORD ROOM.\u201d Faces looked up to the ceiling, to the panelists, and to each other.

To hear the sound of it from their own voice. To feel their mouth form it. It would be so nice--it would make life so easy! &amp;#x200B; A screen projection formed on the wall opposite the judges.

It\u2019s me.\u201d I started to walk towards the panel of judges. \u201cPardon, thank you, excuse me, pardon, sorry, thanks, thank you, my apologies,\u201d I tried to push through the crowd to receive my word, but was continuously impeded by the crowd asking me to speak my word once I\u2019ve received it, to keep them in mind, to not forget them, that it might be the last time they ever hear it. Thankfully I wasn\u2019t too far, and I reached the panel soon. Multiple security officers walked up to me and asked me for a Social Security Number. I whispered it to them, and they led me through the security checkpoint. &amp;#x200B; Two officers then led me to a door behind the judges, and I was escorted through a short hallway, then entered a door on my right. &amp;#x200B; There, on a stainless steel table, was a small holographic box. &amp;#x200B; A figure moved out from the back of the room. \u201cSir, please insert your pinky finger into our box\u2019s center here.\u201d &amp;#x200B; I stepped forward to the table, and hesitantly reached my hand out. I curled up the rest of the fingers, leaving only my pinky extended, and insert it into the box. It felt like air--nothing really. &amp;#x200B; \u201cThank you, Sir. You now have access to Word for one calendar year, 365 days. If you would like, you may reenter the main convention area and speak it.\u201d &amp;#x200B; \u201cYes. Yes, I can do that for them,\u201d I replied. &amp;#x200B; I was escorted back out the same way, with at least half a dozen security guards now. I was important. I could feel the security guards shifting slightly, casting tiny glances at me from the corner of their eyes. They wanted to hear it. &amp;#x200B; I was led back out to the panel area. The judges were lined up in two columns on either side. &amp;#x200B; \u201cGo ahead, sir. The podium is yours.\u201d In front of me was a polished, well-oiled podium made of dark, smooth wood. The crowd moved forward, and all talk quickly ceased--entirely. I couldn\u2019t hear anything in the room. &amp;#x200B; I took a breath, and leaned into the microphone. &amp;#x200B; \u201cthe.\u201d &amp;#x200B; Every person in the convention center eruption into chaos, turmoil, and ecstasy. I leaned in again. &amp;#x200B; \u201cThe.\u201d I saw people tremble, shake, and spasm. They could feel the word resonate throughout their being--it was like a dead loved one come back to life. They wept, and suffered--but were happy that it was still somewhere. I leaned in again, and took the microphone by two hands. &amp;#x200B; \u201cTHE!\u201d A roar crashed over my ears. The security guards next to me were having difficulty controlling their faces, and I could some of their faces twitching, while on others there were tears running down their cheeks.

One minor point, I think you could make this even better by avoiding using \"the\" until the big reveal.

If you were coming from opposite ports, news could be traded, items bartered and tales told. Vessels from rival nations considered impolite to engage in combat without at least announcing your affiliation. When ships did not respond to hailing, it was believed that they could be pirates or other such vagrant and stateless ships of fortune. Rarer still were the ships that responded to no hailing yet made no directed movement. These ships were little more than cork atop a painted sea as it were. Often times, captains would avoid these ships due to their fear of a pirate ambush or disease that could have eradicated the crew. The most stalwart or foolhardy would inevitable investigate in the hopes of abandoned wares. The curious would attempt to learn the fate of the crew. Many such ships were armed with enterprising scoundrels and others piled with bloated corpses. legends persisted, though, of a ship that sat abandoned in perfect working order. The masts stood tall, the food supply was plentiful and there were no signs of struggle. So the legend goes, the cabin would be perfectly livable, no valuable seized in the midst of an onslaught, no overturned furniture showing signs of bombardment. To the contrary, a lavish feast would be laid out yet barely touched. Stranger still the fate of the crew, which, while they may have been corpses, were nowhere to be found. The ship would be full of gold from every nation and state, filled to the brim with treasure. But should any son of the sail feel greed in his heart, and attempt to take what belongs to the sea alone, then he too would find himself joining the crew of the ghost ship. Of course, such tales hold hardly any merit, and their appearance is not surprising considering the time and living conditions of such men. ---------------------------------------- Captains log: Date 11-45-908, 14:08 While carrying cargo from Titan to Europa, we came across a ship. Our initial attempts to hail did not elicit a response. We were unable to establish a frequency on which to transmit. They also did not respond to the laser alerts we beamed onto their receiver. We have docked not far from them and are attempting to make contact by more primitive methods. The Comms officer is waving two naval flags from the bridge but has yet to see any activity. This area has a high fluctuation in radio waves making outside contact almost impossible. I have several pending sit-reps that are sitting in my outbox. I was taught that such ships were often used as bait when attempting to ambush ships carrying important payloads. Mine is nothing but food and soil nutrients for the outer colonies. This shipping route is also unique; our ship is small enough to go through the asteroid field, a rarity among military vessels. In short, nothing important would ever pass by this relic. The ship itself is several decades old, it bears no military marks but the material used is outdated and the design is downright primitive. The prudent choice would be to pass by and drop a beacon for the brass to investigate. But I can't help wonder if any person is stuck on board. I also must admit the whole thing is intriguing to me. I'll ready a boarding party if they do not contact us. Captains log: Date 11-46-908, 06:15 The boarding party is assembled. We will go into the ship, attempt to make contact, take readings and return. Coming with me will be Lt. Onarra and Petty Officer 3rd Class Richardson. We do not plan to be more than an hour. Captains log: Date 11-46-908, 07:33 No contact was made on board the Vliegerij Nederlander. While the readings came back clear and the ship was fully functional, no sign of the crew was in sight. There were no signs of what could have caused the ship to be in such a state. The bridge was operational, there were rations that would last a normal crew at least another month, and there was no signs of struggle. The captain's log was translated, yet answers less questions than it raises. It reads as a completely average log. The ship was apparently transporting heavy elements from a European Block outpost to a terraformed city. I sent Richardson to check the cargo to see if it had been stolen and onarra to check the crew quarters. At that point I hadn't ruled out that a crew member went rogue, flushed the oxygen and took to an escape pod with the elements. Both reports flattened my theory. The elements were still in their containers and the crew quarters were completely spotless. Unfortunately, I must also report on less... feasible developments. While Onarra was searching the crew quarters, she swore she saw someone. She said a man walked in front of a hatchway, stared in, then walked on. She said that she tried to get his attention, but he wouldn't acknowledge her. She says that she followed him into the hall, but found no traces of any person, live or dead. What's more, a scan of the ship returned no traces of any living organism or robotic entity. Not a single live bacterium. Richardson checked the cargo bay and said that every element was accounted for. Even with today's technology a single canister of those elements would make a man rich. Still, government regulations state that any lost item of value found during military operations, even Merchant Marine, must be reported and handed over to Naval Department. Best thing now is to just drop a beacon and move on. It is grizzly to report, but we also found all escape pods un-deployed. I truly hope the crew merely boarded another vessel, because the only other way I can see off that ship is out the airlock. Captains log: Date 11-46-908, 14:52 Richardson and Onarra have been asking to go back. I, too, still have my interests. We will make one more expedition and then resume course. Captains log: Date 11-46-908, 16:24 We shouldn't have gone back. As soon as we boarded Onarra said she saw another sailor. She took off after him as Richardson said the same and took off in the opposite direction. I found Onarra in a cold sweat, weapon drawn. She said that the sailor she had been following turned on her once she was out of my sight. She said that he grabbed her and started to choke her. She said that she felt as though she were drowning underwater. I administered a tranquilizer and brought her back to the ship. Obviously the sight of the ship must have caused a kind of nervous breakdown; our suits come with rigid neck plates and would be usable underwater, not that there's more than a recycler full of water between here and Europa. After I had dropped her in the sick bay, I went back and brought back Richardson. He seemed to be holding up better. He said that the sailor he was chasing had just disappeared. He seemed on edge, but due to everything I think most would be. We've dropped the beacon and are heading on course. <Guybromandudeperson>: Captains log: Date 11-49-908, 13:51 That ship seems like a wounded albatross. Our systems have been problematic ever since we left the abandoned derelict. Our long distance Comm system still isn't operational. System Tech has ruled out any chance of a virus from the wreck, our systems are written in incompatible codes. I suppose just bad luck. Onarra has been in and out of consciousness. Whenever she's unsedated she gets hallucinations and has to be restrained. It is unfortunate but I will have to put her on ice until we finish the trip. I can't risk dosing her with a sedative every day until we arrive, and throwing someone in that state into the brig is too ghastly to imagine. Richardson has returned to normal, if a bit quieter. The trips onto the ship must have taken their toll on him. Captains log: Date 11-49-908, 23:46 I have failed in my duties as Captain of this vessel. At 23:00 I went to the sick bay to check on Onarra. Her sedatives were timed to wear off about then and I was hoping she could have made some progress. My own weakness for hoping there was an easier solution. I was at her bedside when she emerged from her haze. She sat bolt upright and nearly pounced out of the bed. I grabbed her and told her I didn't want to have to restrain her but I would if necessary. She pleaded with me, said she wasn't mad. She said that she needed to follow the sailor and that I had to trust her. The look in her eyes caused me to doubt myself. I released her and, gingerly, followed behind her. She stumbled along the hallways, the medication taking its toll oh her body. After several dark corridors, she brought me to Richardson's quarters. She screamed like a woman possessed and raged against the steel of his door. He cracked the door just an inch (as any sane man would do after such a demonstration). At this point I called for the ships Doctor to restrain her so that we could put her into cryo-sleep. The doctor ran for the sedative as she burst open his door. Lying on his bed was a canister of heavy elements. Screaming condemnation, she snatched the canister and ran. The doctor rounded the corner and was pushed into the wall, dropping the tranquilizer. Richardson followed closely behind her while I tried to keep up. I followed them down unlit corridors and dark hallways. Before my eyes, the walls morphed from steel into wood, the small port holes showing black water instead of the abyss of space. Onarra kept screaming \"It must be sent back, It must be returned\". Richardson returned with \"It's mine, it's mine\". I heard Onarra twittering gleefully to... someone she saw with her. She threw the element in an airlock and began the ejection sequence. Richardson knocked her out of the way and jumped in after the canister. Poor boy. I don't think he realized the sequence had already started. I administered the sedative to Onarra, but I could see in her eyes that she understood what was happening. I watched helplessly as Richardson banged on the lock and plead for his life. I watched as he was spat out into the infinite. We retrieved his corpse within four minutes. Onarra has since been put in cryosleep. Captains log: Date 11-50-908, 08:32 Contact has been made with Naval Dept. No ship bearing the designation Vliegerij Nederlander was found on any register in the past hundred cycles.

Unfortunately you\u2019re really bad at drawing. <WritingMadness>: \"You might be wondering how the end of the world came to be. And well - that is a good question, to which I may have an answer. I am not entirely at fault here, but I do have to take some responsibility, unfortunately. It all started when I turned 13. My parents decided to sign me up for arts class, as a birthday present. Yeah. Lucky me. I came to realize 2 things in the year I spent at that class. One - I was a terrible artist, the kind of kid to struggle with drawing stick-men. And two - I had a 'gift', which allowed me to bring my creations to life. There were but two conditions to that power, as years of experimenting had shown. The first was that it had to be **entirely** drawn by me, and the second condition - is that I had to imagine it, right in front of me after I finished drawing it. It all sounds great and all, but let me tell you - things did not go as planned from the very beginning. As I mentioned before - my drawing skills were subpar, at best - but that did not stop me. Fake money - was my first and least harmful experiment. Needless to say - that did not go as planned. You cannot imagine the detail on these things - its unbelievably complex and detailed. I quickly gave up on that idea, but I was not going to give up on my new found power. I practiced with shapes first, then forms, then more complete objects. They were all terrible - and I brought them all to life. I honestly do not know what I was thinking or why I kept going after each and every failed attempt. Crooked circles - turned into punctured balls. Uneven squares and rectangles turned into dark, welded coils of metal (because I used pencil back then). Pencils and notebooks turned into sharp sticks and one-sheet-notebooks . Light-bulbs did not look like light-bulbs at all - although they did emit a faint light. Trees - were fluffy sticks. Two-dimensional houses - fell flat on their faces, breaking the windows upon emergence. The sun - was a hot, spiky sunflower. Flowers - looked the way a child draws flowers - awful. Plus, they stank. Grass - was spikes. Cars - were - not cars, not cars at all - more like deranged beetles. Nothing was what I wanted it to be. Then I made a mistake. I decided to draw the first 'faced'. You might be wondering - what a 'faced' is. Simply put - it is everything I draw that has a face on it. Yes, 13-year-old-me was a creative genius. As you all know by now, everything that has a face on it - immediately turns sentient, and not in a good way. The sharp-toothed, lazy-eyed, white, wiener dog emerged with a set behavior - to act like I imagined a dog would act - viciously. May the protocol include that I do not like dogs. Why I drew it? I do not know. I was 13 and it seemed easy. Needless to say, the scar on the right palm of my hand - is the result of that upbringing. Luckily, my creations only emerge as large as I draw them to be, so I was able to squash it afterwards - leaving a trail of blood underneath my hand, and the scar remained. As you all know by now - the 'faced' do not die, and the drawings do not disappear once I create them. They cannot burn, and they fully take the properties and characteristics of the things that I imagine in my mind, at the moment of creation. And they cannot be altered in any way.
