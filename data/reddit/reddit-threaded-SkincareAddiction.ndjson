But most acne scars I've seen pictures of are indentations, rather than raised bumps, so while at the dermatologist last week I asked him to take a look and make a treatment recommendation, if possible. His assessment was that they're not scars, but extremely deeply clogged pores, and that pretty much only something like CO2 laser resurfacing would be able to treat them. &amp;#x200B; I've been considering trying a laser treatment for a few years to improve my skin texture. But due to the high cost and overall terrifyingness, I have first tried several less invasive treatments (like microdermabrasion, microneedling, chemical peels, and improving my skincare routine), with no noticeable improvement. My dermatologist might certainly be right about it being clogged pores, though the bumps never change or go away, like scars. &amp;#x200B; I hope this is the right place to ask, but I've become so self-conscious and frustrated with this issue that I am now seriously considering doing the laser thing. I can barely wear makeup without accentuating my textured skin, and I've worn bangs to try and cover it for as long as I can remember. I've never seen a skin condition that looks like this on anyone else before, and researching online hasn't been much help, so I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced a similar problem, and if you may have had any success with laser resurfacing or another treatment, I would love to hear about it.<ManslaughterMary>: I got some laser therapy done for my overactive sebaceous oil glands, and while it was a bit of a hassle, it really helped my skin. My skin isn't a straight up oil slick by noon. I'm still somewhat oily, but the severe acne lessened. I was a teenager when I got that done. My friend who had bad acne and textured skin (and a brief but rough meth addiction) had laser therapy done to her face, and while some of the scars and textures are still noticable in some areas, some patches completely cleared up. She was 27, and the results were definitely an improvement. Personally, at the price tag laser treatment can come with, I am not 100% sure I feel my skin improved about 1000 dollars worth. There we absolute improvement, so I still consider it money mostly well spent, but I feel like it improved 500$ worth. My friend paid more than me (different laser techniques, different needs) and while her skin improved quite noticably, if I paid what she paid I would still expect more improvement. However, it helped her massively with her confidence, and if it fixes a problem that isn't responding to other treatment, it might be a good choice for you. Either way, good luck! <ChemicalAlia>: Thanks for sharing, that's very interesting! I feel like even if I had a 50% improvement, I would be pretty damn happy. It's pretty much a confidence thing for me, too, and very frustrating. My skin is also very flaky and dry, yet somehow also very oily and at 36 I still deal with a decent amount of acne. I'm glad you had some improvement in that regard! :D The steep price of the laser treatment does make it feel like a bit of a last resort, but when I consider all the money I've dumped into alternate options over the years, maybe it wouldn't be such a crazy investment...<DoesTheOctopusCare>: If you're flaky, dry AND oily... have you tried treating for fungal acne? Do you have dandruff ever? <Laspyra>: Sorry to hijack someone else's thread. You just described my t-zone, eyebrows and hairline/scalp. So much flakiness and dryness and oily. It never made any sense to me. Is this something I have to see a doctor about to diagnose and possibly get a prescription? Or are there anti-fungal treatments I can do.

You can use coconut oil (ymmv, some people are slightly allergic topically) or even olive oil in a pinch (feels weird though!).

I found that lactic acid works on well on me so far. I have been using The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% drops. I mix it into serum or moisturizer and apply it. Also, be sure to always use sunscreen when you go out after you use peeling products bc they do make your skin vulnerable to sun rays while they sit on your skin.

Feeling kind of lost and hopeless. So I've struggled with acne for about 7 years (22 years old now). Over the last 4 or so, I went to dermatologists, would get prescribed a retinoid or epiduo and other stuff like BP and clindamycin. Went on doxycycline/minocycline 2-3 times of a couple of months at a time. Throughout this time, my skin has overall been the same. Having anywhere from 3-8 nodules/cysts/pimples. Basically I would deal with my skin as is, at one point it will get extra bad and/or I'll start to lose help of it getting better and I'll visit the derm. I ended moving all the way to the highest strength tazorac, which didn't fully cure me just like the rest. The derm I had at the time said Accutane was the last solution but I was hesitant (but my insurance ended up changing which stopped me from going through with it). Earlier this year, I stopped taking the tazorac to simplify/reset my routine. My skin stayed the same until 1.5 months after (maybe b/c no more tazorac?) and I ended up trying Curology. I've been on Curology for 5 months and although saw improvement earlier on, my skin has been bad lately (but improving now!). I plan on returning to a derm to get a second opinion. But if overall, my skin has gotten worse since Curology, should I cut it or try to change the formula? Current routine: <AM>: * Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser * Solbar Zinc SPF 38 Moisturizing <PM>: * Alternate between Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and Sulfur Topical Suspension Wash (prescribed) * Apply Curology (10% Azelaic Acid, 1% Cindamycin, 0.25% Zinc Pyrithione). * Solbar Zinc SPF 38 Moisturizing As for my previous routine, I don't remember exactly but I was using the Tazorac along with the Cetaphil Wash, Benzly Peroxide, and moisturizer.<saucylackey>: How long did you stay on each prescription before you lost hope and moved on? Do you remember?<deeadpoool>: Can't say for each. But retina a about 1.5 to 2 years. Epiduo maybe 8-12 moths. Tazorac was 1.5 years. <saucylackey>: Good for you, you gave everything a really fair shot. Where is your acne located? And is it mostly cystic?<deeadpoool>: Mainly around the cheek and sides of my jaw.. I think its mainly cystic? I always had a hard time telling. I will get ones that take forever (if at all) to whitehead that are large and last weeks. Some I get will whitehead and go away in a few days. The longer, larger ones are more common for me<saucylackey>: I'm not a derm, but that has all the hallmarks of hormonal acne. Have you tried Aczone or spironolactone before?<deeadpoool>: Haven't tried either. Will look into it! I'm a male tho if that means anything<saucylackey>: Eh, it just makes me less likely to recommend birth control ;) Personally I'd swap over to the CeraVe Foaming Face Wash and CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. Anecdotally I've heard the Cetaphil can be (surprisingly) irritating. The Curology prescription looks solid to me (although I'm not a derm), and if you feel like your skin is getting better I would stick with it for now. Also, are you a big consumer of dairy?<deeadpoool>: Thanks for the help!! I pretty much avoid dairy unless I eat out and theres cheese or something like that. But generally my dairy consumption is quite low. About 2 years ago I went a month avoiding dairy altogether (not sure if I left cheese, etc. out tho, but definitely less than before) and noticed no improvement. Again, that was two years ago but there was a reason I just went back to not worrying about dairy.<saucylackey>: Kudos to you! It helps some people, but if you didn't notice improvements I definitely wouldn't recommend continuing to eliminate it. Yeah, I think going to a derm for a second opinion would be a smart move. But my ears perked up when I heard you say that you were starting to notice positive changes with the Curology prescription, so I wouldn't give up on it yet or start playing around with other actives. Has it given you the best results so far, out of everything that you've tried?<deeadpoool>: Yea i'm going to hold off on introducing new actives for now. I did order some Acne.org Benzyl Peroxide Treatment because I believe using BP helped keep my acne at bay so eventually i will try incorporating that in. For Curology, my face got a bit worse at the start (purging?), then began to improve, then got worse after I started taking whey protein. About 3-4 weeks after stopping the protein it began to get better and is continuing to do so. I will say that my skin texture has definitely improved since going on Curology! Looks a lot more smooth where I don't have acne. I'm sure cutting back on all the drying products has helped also<saucylackey>: It does sound like the whey got in your way X) I'd definitely stick with the Curology (although again, not a derm!) and try to be gentle with your skin in the meantime.

It does have SPF 30 but the coconut oil...I'm not sure if that's what causing some of my breakouts. I'd love to have a sunscreen without worrying about blending it out too much like I do with my CC cream. Is it a thinner consistency? <princepessa420>: I\u2019ve really wanted to try their cc and B.B. creams but I\u2019m scared of the oils! I use jojoba but many break me out. Honestly if I was you I\u2019d try it out, I\u2019ve been using it for YEARS! The only ingredient in it that might break you out is an algae type ingredient (algin?) when I ran it through cosDNA. It\u2019s a very thick consistency, like a thick moisturizer. At first it\u2019s very white bc of the zinc but with a little blending I love how it brightens my skin and helps with some of my discoloration. I\u2019m a white Italian so not sure how it would look on darker skin. But it blends in well and the white cast definitely goes away, I\u2019d say it\u2019s more brightening on lighter skin! I love that it\u2019s physical because I feel like the zinc actually helps some of my breakouts go down and after a long day of wearing this and using la roche possay effaclar duo my acne always seems smaller!

I posted pictures below of it first on, rubbed in, and with a flash :)<Breakaway9999>: I just purchased it this evening. I'll try it out first thing tomorrow :) about 80% my face is affected by vitiligo, so this will hopefully brighten the parts that aren't quite there yet. I'll let you know how it works.

If the sensitivity is really persistent though and doesn't go away after like a week or so, I'd say maybe stop using Differin for a bit to give your skin a break.

A couple of weeks ago I decided to change up my routine (another thing I should not do), by using the products I already had in a new way. I stopped using my benzoyl peroxide treatment and started using my DE night serum instead (previously I only used it once or twice a week). Things were okay, but then my acne started to really flare up so I decided to stop using DE every night. Did I go back to my old, not perfect, but okay routine. Noooo. Instead I bought a new salicylic acid treatment from Murad. That thing really destroyed my skin. Not only did it worsen my acne, it dried my skin out so bad. I almost called out for work because I did not want people to see me. Now, I am backing off anything harsh and I am focusing on reviving my poor, poor face (Thank you Aquaphor!).

My skin is acne prone, slightly dehydrated and starting to age. I\u2019m using hormonal birth control to control my acne. I have pigmentation and scars from a bad breakout last year which I\u2019m undergoing fractional mesotherapy (micro needling) to treat. After the treatment I can only use gentle products for a week and no actives. I\u2019ve been focusing on hydrating my skin. Products I bought are; **Banila Clean it Zero Balm Revitalising** I bought this to replace my current oil cleanser (was using the MooGoo oil cleanser but it doesn\u2019t emulsify well and the packaging makes it difficult to travel with). So far I like the feel of the product, how well it emulsifies in water, and the packaging, which is good for travelling as well as just looking cute in general. The smell is ok, and not too overwhelming but I don\u2019t have the best sense of smell anyway. **CosRX Triple C lightening liquid** As I have some pigmentation I\u2019ve been testing out vitamin C serums to improve the pigmentation. I\u2019ve tried the andalou natural Tumeric + C enlightening serum which felt nice but smelt a bit funny and I didn\u2019t see much results. I\u2019ve been using the skinstitut even blend serum but I\u2019m not a fan of the gel texture, it feels too heavy. This feels really light on my skin and doesn\u2019t really have a smell. It\u2019s too early to see any results. **CosRX Low PH Good Morning Gel Cleanser** so far I haven\u2019t tried this. I bought it to replace my nuetrogena hydro boost gel cleanser which I love the feel off, and leaves my skin feeling clean but not tight, however I do not like the fragrance. I will finish the bottle before I open this. **CosRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essense** I bought this to add some extra moisture into my routine and because I heard it can be good for acne and breakouts. However I then heard it can cause a reaction in people with shellfish allergies so it\u2019s going to undergoing some serious patch testing before I incorporate it in my routine. I might not include it until the new year just in case I have a reaction (too many social events before Christmas). If I end up not being able to use it I\u2019ll give it to my sister. **Various sheet masks** bought these as stocking stuffers for Christmas for my sister and best friends. Hopefully they have some fun with them. All the products came from Soko glam, shipping to Australia took about a week and it came well packed with lots of air packet thingies to protect the products. I also got a couple of samples of Ascen TOC toner, but as I\u2019m avoiding actives atm I probably won\u2019t use these. <crrunchygranola>: I have a shellfish allergy and have always wondered about the snail products for that reason!

Does your moisturizer have mineral oil? And anyway, while oil cleansing really helps, the real magic is in acids. Tretinoin helps too (speaking from experience). So I suggest just using a bha or aha toner two to three times a week. That should help without the need for oil cleansing. Slower and less satisfying to be sure tho haha<rinsue_8>: Is there a particular way I should have cleansed it off? I was just using water to rinse it off. I'm a noob when it comes to skincare. No, I switched moisturizers after the milia outbreak. Thank you for the suggestions!<Armamama>: Well some people do that, but for some people residual oil can trap bacteria and oil in pores resulting in all kinds of breakouts. Would not recommend it with mineral oil though. Some organic oil like rosehip or jojoba is probably better for that method. The better method for you is probably to use your foaming cleanser and make sure to wash every bit of oil off your face. There are emulsifying oil cleansers which wash off with water but those can be expensive.

I wish I'd bought two, honestly, because I'd love to throw my decanted face sprays and more essences in there.<Ellieissokay>: They had a bigger 12 can sized one. I was going to get it until I realized it was plastic and $45, so I opted for the smaller one. Now I'm wishing I had gotten the larger one because I am very limited as to what I can put in it. Not like I needed the bigger one, haha. My bathroom is full and this is on a dressing chest right outside of it.. I have all of my cabinets full, under the sink, the large windowsill, the rack above the toilet, plus [this cart](http://imgur.com/a/qnOgOHl) that I bought from Tj Maxx for my main products and samples. I have way more skincare than anyone would ever need, but that doesn't stop me from buying anything and everything that interests me. It's definitely a problem, lol. I *wanted* the larger one.. but most definitely did not *need* the larger one. I might just take all of my deluxe sample jars and bottles that I have used up, take a magic eraser to the branding and use them to store smaller portions of stuff I use everyday.

The most important thing to me is that a sunscreen is non-irritating, free of fragrance, contains stable sunscreen actives, doesn't leave any whitecast/tint and feels pleasant on skin. I have sensitive-dehydrated skin that feels dry quickly, I don't like a greasy/shiny sunscreen either. I've rated every sunscreen and I added a rating for it's oiliness and whitecast. Of course the overall rating is quite personal, all sunscreens in the list have some good/interesting aspects. So something with a 5 is not perse worse than something with a 7. To give an example; I've given the Paula's Choice Resist SPF30 a 5.5, it was the wrong color, expensive, very drying and the uva protection could be low. However if you have a darker skin tone that's very oily, and you live in the US, I can imagine you like it very much. The ingredients are good, although the uva protection remains low of course. Good luck finding your holy grail sunscreen! I've found some good ones, but not really my holy grail, so if you have tips for a good sunscreen please let me know. &amp;#x200B; [Go to the spreadsheet with all sunscreens](https://drive.google.com/file/d/184GCIxZ9YH4tAn2kF1UmyO2JS6yZLjEE/view?usp=sharing) (easiest to read on a laptop/desktop) &amp;#x200B; **Whitecast and shine:** |Whitecast|Shine| |:-|:-| |0: no whitecast|0: completely matte| |1: slight whitecast, barely noticeable|1: not very shiny| |2: noticeable whitecast, easy to offset with foundation|2: a bit shiny| |3: very visible whitecast|3: shiny| |4: strong white/purple whitecast.|4: very shiny| &amp;#x200B; **How much to use for the face:** |Facial Area (cm2)|Sunscreen amount (gram)|source| |:-|:-|:-| |600 (456 + 144 for neck)|0.91 + 0.29|[Labmuffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKS5kMbZBlk&amp;t=8m49s)| |785 (550 + 230 for neck)|1.11 + 0.46|[ECHA, 2017](https://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/21664016/recom_14+_default+human_factor_values_biocidal+products_en.pdf/88354d31-8a3a-475a-9c7d-d8ef8088d004#page=6)| |565 (face only, 1140 incl scalp)|1.15|[Nordic Council, 2011](https://books.google.nl/books?id=vNVrYKh4_BQC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=cm2+facial+area&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7mLgRQWKqd&amp;sig=YaR40h-oFLuSjAVOeTi2aQ_861I&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjdsKv7sZDfAhUJ2aQKHRftDiIQ6AEwBnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cm2%20facial%20area&amp;f=false)| |594 (18000\\*3.3%)|1.18|[Bender et al., 1995](https://www.elsevier.com/books/benders-dictionary-of-nutrition-and-food-technology/bender/978-1-84569-051-9) and [Nordic Council annex B](http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:702615/FULLTEXT01.pdf#page=148)| |619|1.25|[futurederm](https://www.futurederm.com/how-much-exactly-is-2-0-mgcm2-the-amount-of-sunscreen-necessary-to-achieve-the-labeled-spf-rating/)| |650 (1300\\*50%)|1.3|[RIVM,2014](https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/090013003.pdf#page=49)| |685|1.37 (face +neck)|[Dr. Dray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y24twlGzsJA&amp;t=10m48s)| |Average|1.15 (face) + 0.37 (neck)|| &amp;#x200B; **Sunscreen actives:** |Good ss actives|Okay ss actives| |:-|:-| |Tinosorb S|Avobenzone (good uva protectant, but unstable and high chance on skin reactions )| |Tinosorb M|Octocrylene (very stable, but forms free radicals, penetrates skin easily)| |Tinosorb A2B|Titanium Dioxide (stable, but stability of coatings is still unknown, increases free radical production)| |Uvinal A Plus|Ensulizole (stable, but does have some risk of skin reactions and increase in free radicals)| |Mexoryl XL|Homosalate (stable, but penetrates skin easily and risk of skin reactions)| |Mexoryl SX|| |Uvinul T150|| |Uvasorb HEB|| |Zinc Oxide|| |Polysilicone-15|| |Octisalate (on it's own not very stable, but can easily be stabilized, no further concerns)|| &amp;#x200B; **Ingredients that can better be avoided:** |Ingredient|| |:-|:-| |Fragrance, linalool, limonene, etc|Common skin allergen and also irritant, no role in skincare| |Bergamot oil, citrus extracts, Eucalyptus oil, menthol|Can increase skin irritation and photosensitivity| |Methlyl(chloro)isothiazolione|Problematic preservative| |Oxybenzone|Increases free radicals, penetrates skin very easily, high change on skin irritation, unstable and not environment friendly| |Octinoxate (Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate)|increases free radicals, penetrates skin very easily, unstable and not environment friendly| |Enzacamene|penetrates skin easily and increases free radical production, not approved by FDA and Japan| |Padimate O|| |Isoamyl p-Methoxycinnamate (Amiloxate)|| |Olive oil|due to high oleic acid content can disrupt skin barrier| |Alcohol|When present in very high concentrations, can disrupt the skin barrier, concentrations &lt;5% shouldn't cause any problems| &amp;#x200B;<Odd_Manner>: What do you think of this sunscreen?

Formulated to minimize the risk of allergies. Developed specifically for sensitive skin. Hypoallergenic. Fragrance free. <Peter_789>: Yes it's good. I've been considering it as well, but was afraid that it still leaves a whitecast due to the Tinosorb M. <ggabrielpp>: It does leave horrible white cast. It is just unusable. And reading the ingredients, before i bought it, I had such high hopes for this sunscreen. It also streaks while I apply it and pills later. The only positive thing about it is that RoC Protect Recomforting High Tolerance Fluid is quite matte on my oily skin. <Odd_Manner>: I notice that if I put a light moisturizer on before it, it doesn't pill. What do you use for sunscreen?<ggabrielpp>: Maybe I used way too much then. Right now I am transitioning from Oriflame Sun Zone Face and Body Protector SPF 30 to Eucerin Oil Control SPF 50+, as I want higher spf than 30. <Odd_Manner>: How did you like the Oriflame sunscreen? Did it produce a white cast?<ggabrielpp>: I like it quite much actually. No white cast at all. It contains old and new (chemical) UV filters, including Tinosorb S. It should offer some descent UVA protection and is fragrance free. It also has *Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate* that helps with matte finish to some extent. However, it is still greasy for my oily skin, so I have to blot my face some 30 mins after the application. All in all, it is one of the best sunscreens I have used.<Odd_Manner>: Thank you", "num_messages": 9, "avg_score": 12.0}

Most of the time; by the end of the session the areas worked on are incredibly irritated and bloody. To me it wouldn't seem much worse to walk around with the acne and allow it to subside instead. Anyhow, what are your thoughts? and has you been a subject to this and how did it turn out? ~~^(p.s. who is your favorite pimple popping youtuber??)~~ &amp;#x200B;<LeRemy>: I have no experience with this, just personal opinions. If it's that bad, that you are going to an esthetician to pop the pimples. Then you're better off beginning on accutane/spirolactone, because yea. You get rid of the pimples then and there, but doesn't do anything about why you get acne. Which accutane/spirolactone do, the acne is just going to come back otherwise.<amk933>: You get Accutane, you get Accutane, he gets Accutane, everyone gets Accutane! How lovely! Are you serious? Dermatologists do not treat every case of acne with Accutane for a good reason. First, your acne can return after Accutane. Second, Accutane has a plethora of side effects (from photosensitivity through endocrine problems to psychiatric issues) and contraindications (e.g. pregnancy). Third, you have so many topical alternatives like azelaic acid, clindamycin, BP, Rx retinoids, salicylic acid and more with a better safety profile that jumping straight to the A-bomb for acne makes no sense. Fourth, not all acne is the same - if hormones cause your skin problems, then balancing these will help you more with the root cause (and maybe turn your attention to other important underlying issues) than chugging Accutane. I am not saying do not ever use Accutane. However, recommending that everyone who has acne should undergo Accutane treatment is preposterous. Sure, use isotretinoin for the worst cases, but many others can benefit from alternative treatment options.<LeRemy>: I can't say I have bad acne, I still got it. Because I wanted. Doing research is good, but who are you to say that one shouldn't use accutane in mild cases? Like, \"Your acne isn't that bad, so you don't get accutane\" It sounds pretentious to me. Mental problems because of accutane, is because one already are predisposed of it. So if a person is getting depression of their acne, accutane often makes skin worse before it gets better. This will break an already depressed mind.<amk933>: Mental problems caused by Accutane because you are predisposed? LOL. You probably also get endocrine and cardiovascular problems while on Accutane and at 20 something years of age because you are predisposed as per that comical hypothesis. You can make whatever decisions you want for yourself, I do not care. As long as you harm no one, do as you wish. However, just as you have the right to say whatever you want (no matter how reckless as in this case), so do I have the right to call you out and share my own opinion (hoping that someone who does not really need Accutane will not decide to go down that route).<LeRemy>: Of course you can call me out, but this may be my personal opinion. You haven't done so in a nice way, but that's okay. It's not my problem, I'm just pointing it out. I can't say anything without proof. Btw, you don't get Accutane without doing anything first. If BP works for you as an example, great. I don't shame you for that.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": -1.0}

Sukari Babyfacial (once a week) Lancome Tonique Confort Re-Hydrating Comforting Toner with Acacai Honey Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intensive Recovery Ampoules (once a week usually whenever I use Babyfacial) Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Cream Synchronized Complex II/Clinique All About Eyes Rich Clinique Moisture Surge 72-Hour Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask (once a week) Shelfie Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel I use this whenever I want a deeper cleanse or a lighter exfoliation, my skin always feels sooo smooth after I use this. Drunk Elephant T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial Haven\u2019t heard about this in a minute but I still love it. The twenty minutes you have to leave this on aren\u2019t the best (there definitely is a tingling) but this has helped so much with my texture and dullness. Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex II I could go on forever about this product but suffice to say that if I could only pick one skincare product, it would be this. It\u2019s just so instantly hydrating. If I neglect my skin for too long (hello finals), it gets dry to the point where it\u2019s painful putting on products so I\u2019ll ease back into my routine by using this. And it gives you just the nicest glow. Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intensive Recovery Ampoules Bought this solely based on how much I love the serum. I like it, and it\u2019s certainly hydrating, but not nearly as much as the serum. At $115, I would definitely say that it\u2019s not worth it. Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Cream Synchronized Complex II Another product I bought because of how much I love the serum. It\u2019s not bad but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it, and it does make me eyes tingle a bit. Still in search of a good eye cream. Clinique Moisture Surge 72-Hour Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Another favorite of mine! I love, love this cream. It leaves my skin feeling so plump, dewy, and of course, moisturized. Even though I have dry skin, I use so many products that I don\u2019t want a heavy moisturizer, so this gel cream is great. If you\u2019re interested, the 0.5 oz is actually a better deal than the 1 oz. Peter Thomas Roth Max Sheer All Day Moisture Defense Lotion SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever run out of this sunscreen because it is in absolutely every Sephora Sun Safety Kit ever. Not sure what to say about a sunscreen except that I never burn and this is usually moisturizing enough without another moisturizer underneath. philosophy Ultimate Miracle Worker Multi-Rejuvenating Cream SPF 30 Another find from the Sun Safety Kit. I hate how small this is because I love, love how it feels, so velvety. I\u2019m debating on buying a full size of this whenever philosophy has a gift with purchase even though I have a lot of sunscreen to go through, that\u2019s how much I love this. AMOREPACIFIC Resort Collection Sun Protection Mist Let me start off by saying that I know that a mist is no replacement for a sunscreen but I do like using this to reapply sun protection if I can\u2019t use my hands Clinique Chubby Stick Moisturizing Lip Colour Balm Not especially moisturizing but nice if you want a tint of color. Clarins Double Serum Complete Age Control Concentrate All the Clarins products are new so I can\u2019t really say but will definitely give updates if anyone would like me to. Clarins Multi Active Day Cream Clarins Multi-Active Night Cream Clarins SOS Comfort Nourishing Balm Mask First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads I only use Babyfacial once a week so I wanted something that I could use the rest of the week. I think this is great daily exfoliator that helps with texture and brightening. You definitely have to use this regularly to notice the results but when you do, your skin will look sooo much better. Caudalie Hand and Nail Cream Moisturizing but no better than the Aveeno lotion I use for my hands. Clinique Moisture Surge Overnight Mask From the same line as the moisturizer I love, this is another product I like, but isn\u2019t absolutely necessary. Like the moisturizer, it leaves skin feeling plump and dewy, but I prefer the moisturizer\u2019s gel texture. Clinique Moisture Surge Face Spray Can\u2019t be 100% sure that it\u2019s this product because I\u2019ve only used it a few times but whenever I do, my face tends to tingle. First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Hydrating Serum This is a great serum for hydrating and plumping but I love the Estee Lauder one so much that I rarely ever reach for this. Clinique All About Eyes Rich Moisturizing, but I don\u2019t think it really does much for brightening like it claims it does. Kiehl\u2019s Since 1851 Glow Formula Skin Hydrator Leaves skin looking super dewy, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s really all that moisturizing. First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration I know this is a favorite of so many people but since I love gel creams, I hardly ever use this. Because they say that this can relieve dry patches due to eczema, I expected it to do more for my dry hands. Maybe I set the bar too high but it does help with my hands, I just need to use it more regularly! CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser (not pictured) A classic. This is a gentle cleanser which doesn\u2019t leave my skin feeling tight and uncomfortable after I use it. I don\u2019t really wear makeup so I can\u2019t say for myself but I have heard that you need to double cleanse if you use this. Lancome Tonique Confort Re-Hydrating Comforting Toner with Acacai Honey (not pictured) I keep seeing that you don\u2019t really need to use a toner but this is a step I almost never skip. This has such a nice, soothing effect whenever I put this on. And my face tends to heat up a lot (not sure if it\u2019s a skin or anxiety thing) but this helps cool it down.<Hello_are_you_ufo>: I love, love, love this!

That doesn't mean you have to disclose those exact details, js. <neutralpunches>: Sometimes it can be pretty obvious (e.g. someone who is gender non-conforming).<Tutiloo>: Gender non conformity has ziltch to do with LGBT. <betteroffinbed>: ??? For a start, the T in LGBT stands for transgender...<Tutiloo>: Being gender non conforming doesn't equal being trans. Patti Smith, GNC long before it was trendy yet all woman. Feminine and masculine are just sex role stereotypes pushed onto us, its entirely fine to be a masculine woman or a feminine man and not be trans. Actually it's pretty important not to appropriate the experience of those who struggle with gender dysphoria by suggesting that GNC is the same thing. GNC is just not buying into girls like Barbie's and boys can't cry shit that gets shoved down our throats. Sex role stereotypes for women and girls includes being passive and unassertive and accepting men's superiority and entitlement to our bodies, I've yet to meet a woman who identify's with that, so I've yet to meet a woman who isn't GNC, and most women I know aren't trans.<plo83>: Long before it was trendy? People's gender dysphoria is a trend to you? What a sicko! Violence against trans people and gender non-conforming folks is at an all-time high. Let's call it a trend so people feel like these individuals are making a choice and reinforce negative stereotypes!<Tutiloo>: Being gnc has nothing to do with being trans, stop appropriating the experience of people struggling with gender dysphoria. Being gnc is a completely different thing that is absolutely a choice, it's Nicky Wire choosing to wear a skirt on stage even though he is 100% ok with being a man, Patti Smith choosing a more masculine look even though she's every bit a woman, or every person out there who makes the choice to step away from sex role stereotypes, and plenty of those people are not LGBT+ . Suffering with gender dysphoria is completely different from choosing to be GNC and the violent and ugly thing would be to appropriate the experience of those suffering with it. <plo83>: So you think that trans people are gender conforming? lol Also, we do not say ''suffering with gender dysphoria''. You're talking like it's a plague. A person can suffer due to the feelings they are experiencing because of the gender dysphoria. They can suffer due to the confusion it may cause. They suffer before their feelings are acknowledged. They suffer because people are ignorant. Educate yourself instead of bullying people online.", "num_messages": 12, "avg_score": 164.9166666667}

At my wits end. Hi everyone. I recently have been getting all of these little bumps everywhere. They are very visible in the correct lighting, but face on they don\u2019t look as bad. I have been dealing with these for months and I\u2019m getting very depressed. (PHOTOS BELOW) I was a long time PC 2% BHA user and stopped about two months ago because I felt I was over exfoliating. So I gave my skin about a week break of just cleansing and moisturizing. Fast forward, it didn\u2019t help. Should I start using the BHA again? Differin? Please any help is appreciated! Current routine: AM&amp;PM: cleanse with A.N.D. Balancing bar, moisturize with A.N.D. Hydrotant gel (recently trying CeraVe PM because I feel I need more moisture. Only used this one night so far. <Photos>: https://imgur.com/a/FRV2io5 May be worth mentioning: I try to limit diary and sugar intake. I consume no gluten/wheat due to an allergy and I take a probiotic daily. <cammmm->: i had these bumps on my forehead awhile ago and they drive me nuts so i feel your pain. i think mine were a combination of fungal and bacterial acne. i used nizoral shampoo as a mask for 5-10 mins and they improved a lot. i also started using my friends clindamycin phosphate pledgets which you have to get from a dermatologist and now my forehead is completely smooth. i would start with a fungal acne safe routine first and try the nizoral and see if it helps to rule out fungal acne. look up simpleskincarescience on google. his product suggestions for fungal acne and acne in general are very helpful. hope this helps!<catherinekatern>: Thank you so much! I\u2019ll definitely look into that. I have been suspecting fungal for a while but I take a daily probiotic so I feel like that should protect against that but who knows! Skin is crazy. Thanks for the website, it looks super informative !<CousyCousy>: Came here just to say it looks fungal! I was dealing with bumps all over my forehead for monthssss and could not figure it out ( I also take probiotics and eat pretty clean, but I guess stripping by moisture barrier really messed with my forehead). I alternated Ketoconazole wipes (sold for pets but hey, it works) &amp; Lotrimin for a week and they COMPLETELY went away. Have been doing a fungal safe routine as well, and things are staying clear fingers freakin' crossed.<catherinekatern>: Thank you for this! I\u2019m pretty sure my moisture barrier was damaged as well and it went haywire like you talked about. Did you have them on your forehead only?? <CousyCousy>: Yup, only on my forehead! It was the strangest, but also makes sense because that was the area I hit hardest with chemical exfoliants and thus the most stripped part of my face. I also went through a very very stressful few months, which I think can trigger fungal infections as well. In terms of products, I think the the Lotrimin Ultra has been crucial because it not only has the antifungal ingredient (butenafine) cream so more moisturizing than the wipes. I only used the Ketoconazole wipes for the first little bit to help really attack it, but the Lotrimin has been what I use every few nights since then to maintain a clear forehead. Hoping I'll be able to phase it out completely soon as I introduce a Curology script with Zinc in it (which also helps fungal acne). Phew. That was a lot. But I've learned SO MUCH dealing with this, happy to share anything I know!<catherinekatern>: Thank you so much, seriously I appreciate it. I have bumps on my cheeks as well but they are nothing like the ones on my forehead. I actually got a chemical peel a couple weeks ago and it didn\u2019t show as much improvement as it should have, which I\u2019m guessing is a sign of fungal acne (maybe, right?) Would you mind sharing your current routine with me?<CousyCousy>: PM -bioderma micellar water to remove makeup -vanicream cleanser -amara organics aloe vera gel -cerave baby moisturizing cream -sometimes I mix a few drops of tea tree oil or biossance squalane oil or both (changes based on how my skin is doing) -lotrimin ultra just on forehead (will go light on moisturizer there if using) <AM>: -in the AM I skip micellar water and sometimes even the vanicream -amara organics aloe vera gel -cerave baby cream -Alastin HydraTint SPF (not fully fungal safe but I love it too much to let it go) -If needed, Bare minerals powder Additional Thangs! -spot treat with de la cruz sulfur ointment for 10 ish min -currently trying to incorporate curology zinc/azelaic acid/tret but unsure how I feel about it yet comparison of my forehead, a few weeks apart: [fungal acne comparison ](https://imgur.com/gallery/K7dsZ0s) <catherinekatern>: Wow it looks amazing!

What about butter?<NiceOnesie>: Not OP, but my skin hates milk and ice cream but I have no issues with cheese. I wonder if it\u2019s related to the reduction in lactose through culturing. YMMV but thought I\u2019d point it out for a fellow cheese enthusiast :) <FPS_Russia>: Just thought I'd chime in here to touch on what you said about lower lactose content in cheese (you're absolutely right about the decrease in lactose). So lactose is a type of sugar, which is digested by the lactase enzyme. Everyone reduces their production of lactase as they age (it's medically referred to as a primary lactose intolerance), which is why kids can drink heaps of milk, but adults cannot. Now lets talk about cheese :). So cheese has a rather low sugar content (and butter has virtually no sugar). Given that lactose is a sugar, that means that cheese has a much lower lactose content than milk and ice cream. Further, lactose intolerance is not an allergy, and thus typically a low quantity of lactose can be digested with ease, however we become intolerant to larger quantities. Ultimately, the low volume of lactose in cheese doesn't overwhelm your enzyme production, so no problems occur but milk will deplete your enzymes quite quickly. <Note>: this is regarding lactose intolerance, I'm not entirely sure if this is responsible for the effect of cheese on skin, but it's probable.

Here\u2019s what I recommend: Day 1: Apply a bit of the product behind your ear, and leave it on throughout the day. This will test for an allergic reaction. If you don\u2019t have any response to it, you\u2019re good to move on to testing it on your face. Days 2\u20137: Decide on a small patch of skin (no bigger than a coin) on your face where you want to test the product, and apply a bit of the product to that area every day for a week. I recommend an area like your forehead or cheek, where you\u2019re likely to have a reaction. In your case, if you had patch tested that cream, you would have noticed a bunch of little bumps developing on that patch of skin and known to stop using the product. That\u2019s really the whole point of patch testing. It just prevents you from having a reaction all over your face. It\u2019s a lot easier to clear things up when they only happen on a small patch of skin.<gkrhdvc>: \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d thank you so much!! :D :D<saucylackey>: You\u2019re so welcome!

Let me count the ways in which Sephora has disappointed me this year: 1. You get $15 off of a $75 spend this year instead of $50 last year. 2. You only get two free samples now instead of the three like it's been since inception. 3. Your status and points expire faster now than in the past. 4. They don't give any free shipping codes at the check out counter when they used to do this. 5. Changed their return policy to be more strict (I get it, some people were abusing it.) 6. Spending thresholds for GWP keep getting higher, e.g. $45 in the past and now $90. In conclusion, I think they're getting too greedy.

For returns in-store and by mail, you have up to 60 days to get a full refund in the form you paid, within 61-90 days, you get store credit. After 90 days it's permanently yours! Here's the policy [link](https://www.sephora.com/returns-exchanges) if you want to read it.<lukibunny>: Ahh well i usuaully know by the first week if i wanna return something so 60 days is more than reasonable... i mean some stores are like 30 days.. <girlbones25>: I agree that 60 days is twice as long as most stores but it is still a decrease in a benefit. One of the reasons I liked the longer return policy was if I bought an item, forgot about it, never used it, and decided I liked something else more that I purchased more recently. I did that once with an overpriced eye cream.<lukibunny>: can always bring it back and say you got it as a gift and there is no receipt. If it's brand new, they will probably give you a store credit and take it back. No loss to them and no loss to you. <girlbones25>: Nope, you can't do that anymore under the new return policy! \"If you are returning a Sephora gift that you received by mail and do not want the refund to go to the purchaser, before mailing the return please call 1-877-SEPHORA (1-877-737-4672) to set-up the gift return under your account.\" All other returns require a receipt or a gift-receipt!<lukibunny>: oh that sucks!<girlbones25>: Indeed! I should add that from reading the return policy it seems like \"all other returns require a receipt or a gift-receipt!\" but that part was my quote, not to confuse the quote from Sephora's actual policy.

My eye doc got on me about the same thing, because I was wearing the one month contacts you can sleep in. Using artificial tears every day and cleaning the contacts overnight once a week has really helped. <alexsaurrr>: Also be very careful if you sleep in your contacts, even if they are meant to be slept in.

When you are sleeping your face can rub against your pillow weird, which moves your contact (think about when you rub your eyes and how the contacts can feel \u201cout of place\u201d for a second). Usually we can \u201cblink\u201d them back into place, but when you are sleeping you can\u2019t. Sometimes, the contact edges can cause very small cuts which you can\u2019t feel. Those cuts can then get bacteria in them, causing infections (or in my case, an ulcer). Taking them out to soak in saline solution every once in a while helps keep the contact hydrated and flexible, reducing the chance of cuts, and cleans off excess proteins or bacteria. That way *if* they do cut your eye, the chance of infection is much lower :) Please know I\u2019m saying all of this not to lecture you by any means! Excessively dry contacts mixed with sleeping in them seriously contributed to my eye ulcer. <qwerty0521>: i think we are talking about different types of contacts :) i wear ortho k lenses which are hard and do not move at all in my eyes and we\u2019re not supposed to use saline solution with them. <alexsaurrr>: We are definitely talking about a different type, but they are still pieces of plastic that sit on your eyes and can cause cuts.

I will eat it maybe once a week without side effects. I used to pretty much eat only mac and cheese when my skin was at its best, so I have no idea if this is a factor. &amp;nbsp; **Where it all began:** Hey, long time lurker here. I came here for some advice once pretty much at the start of this treacherous journey. I've been documenting my skin since the beginning, but I've been hesitant to post about it. Here I am! I'm back pretty much to 1. get a little advice and 2. show y'all my skin. I don't think I'm knowledgeable and cleared up enough to really make this teachable as much as I wish I could, lol. &amp;nbsp; Here's a run-down of the story of my skin. As the age-old tale goes; I spent my whole life with clear skin (besides a pimple or two on my chin) I used to get so many compliments! In February, started breaking out in tiny CCs all over my forehead for a reason I still haven't figured out for sure *(I suspect either switching from a BCP to an IUD, or transitioning out of vegetarianism to being an omnivore)*. I started w/typical googling of symptoms and found SCA. I first suspected CCs, and tried using TO's 10% LA, Niacinamide, and 2% SA. Didn\u2019t do jack, and I think the SA was breaking me out (FA?). The CCs started to spread down my temples, and I got clogged pores along with a pimple here or there on my inner cheeks. The pimples I would get on my chin also multiplied. Upon more SCA perusing, and finding Simple Skincare Science, I suspected fungal acne. I tried Nizoral &amp; Stridex which only dried out my skin and things continued to worsen. I used Vanicream cleanser, Hada Labo premium lotion, Cerave in the tub, Vanicream Z bar, and Stridex on &amp; off during this time. &amp;nbsp; In July, I went on a trip to Thailand. This is when I would say my skin was at its worst. I saw a derm (family connection) there who I tried to get a KOH scrape from, but she denied me (language barriers probably didn't help) saying fungal acne wasn't likely, and the treatment was the same for fungal and bacterial acne. She went on to prescribe me the typical acne treatment: a SA face wash, moisturizer, BP, an antibiotic, and differin. I didn't do this for fear I'd fuck up my moisture barrier for good, and that the antibiotic would only allow for more malassezia growth if it did happen to be the case. I continued on with pretty much the same routine as before, (similar to what I do now)and my skin somehow started to clear up. &amp;nbsp; **Actives &amp; products I've tried worth mentioning:** *Note: I\u2019ve used them all at varying degrees and lengths in between. It can be hard to tell what did what, so this is a general consensus. * -*Nizoral 2%:* dried me out, especially in conjunction with Stridex. Bad idea, ik, but didn\u2019t seem to help w/ my bumps -*Stridex Max 2%:* I never know if this works but it hasn't seemed to hurt unless I use it days in a row -*Vanicream Z bar ZnP 2%* (not FA safe!): I think this has actually really helped me despite not being FA safe. -*Finacea gel 15%*: probably what has cleared me up as of recent. I don\u2019t always use it, but when I do, I usually notice a difference in texture the next day. Sometimes I\u2019ll get a random pimple after using it, though. I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re supposed to use it daily, but I\u2019m too chicken to commit to an active like that. -*De La Cruz Sulfur ointment 10%:* Meh. Hard to really tell if this helps. I\u2019ve only used it a few times recently, and usually while using Finacea and/or Stridex so idk. Nothing that I\u2019ve noticed though, sadly. -*Hada Labo Premium lotion:* love this stuff!! Glad I incorporated it. Hard to say if it made my skin better, but it always makes it feel nice and makeup applies more smoothly. -*Hada Labo perfect gel:* Eh. I started using this in place of CeraVe after getting it in Thailand, and my skin started to clear up a bit. After stopping both, my skin seems even more clear. When I try using this again, it seems to break me out. It was probably the CeraVe -*CeraVe in the tub:* love/hate. I\u2019m so bad at telling when things break me out (partially bc of my sporadic habits). I think it clogs my pores, hence above, but I love the way it makes my skin feel right when I put it on. -*Aquaphor*: I've tried the slug life a few times and I\u2019m not sure how I feel about it. However, not important to this post but worth mentioning: this over the Hada Labo Premium lotion makes my lips feel amazing! I have a lip biting problem and my lips look so much better than they used to doing this. -*Biore UV Perfect face milk:* Does the job without breaking me out, I think that's good for a sunscreen? -*Aloe Vera:* I've used so many different types of aloe in the past, even before this whole SCA journey, it's hard to list them all. So far, they've only done me well. I can't say exactly what it does for me because I've always used aloe. I love the refreshing feeling and I believe it has repairing properties. -*Rosewater:* Something I also used to use as a refresher. I now like it just to have as some sort of good-smelling spray that plumps up the HA in my Hada Labo premium lotion. -*Timeless Squalane:* Lives up to all the good claims I've seen on this sub and over at SSS. Not much more to say! There are plenty of reviews for this guy. &amp;nbsp; **As of now**, I\u2019ve been concerned w/ some of the pimples as you can see in the pic, some remaining ccs/clogs, and scarring. I'm considering trying the differin I still have from Thailand, but I think overuse of products could be got me into this mess in the first place, so I'm hesitant. I also plan on seeing a derm where I live in the states to hopefully get some better communication and get that KOH scrape. Please let me know if you have any thoughts/suggestions. I know I\u2019m pretty unorganized and lengthy w/all of this so I appreciate anyone who stuck around! Much love. <Edit>: Spelling/formatting<lovergold>: PS, with all the product mentions, would this count as a review? Sorry I massively crowded this post... just so many skin woes<scumteam14>: Those definitely count!! Also I think your formatting is awesome :) As for actual routine feedback, I think I'd either stick with what you have now till you get to see the derm you're planning on, or just slowly and methodically work your way through the rest of the acne treatment lineup. Fungal acne is relatively rare and I wouldn't put all your eggs in that basket till you know for sure, but there's nothing wrong with getting a KOH scrape. It might help to list all the acne treatments you've tried along with the ones you haven't. Also, keep in mind that products might break you out for reasons other than FA! I'm not trying to dissuade you from FA entirely, I just think it's good to keep your options open and not hone in too strictly on one thing (especially if that one thing requires a derm diagnosis) * BHA - Stridex, TO Salicylic Acid * AHA - TO Lactic Acid * Benzoyl peroxide - * Azelaic acid - Finacea (you noted has helped the most - maybe decrease the frequency of Stridex, increase the frequency of AzA?) * Sulfur - De La Cruz * Retinoids - * Antibiotics - Personally, I'd just work your way through the acne treatments one at a time. If Stridex isn't helping and you've been using it for a month+, drop it and focus on Finacea. If that doesn't start helping after a month+, drop it and move on to benzoyl peroxide. And so on and so forth, eventually hitting derm prescriptions. As long as you go through your options slowly and methodically, there's no reason to be scared of trying new actives, especially since you've only mentioned dryness in response to specific actives and not overall dehydrated or damaged skin. You seem to have a healthy respect for actives in general, and you seem to know your skin quite well, so you'd know if things were becoming too irritating. Trust your own judgement :)<lovergold>: Sweet, thank you! :) &amp;#x200B; About the FA, my main justification for this is that I've taken a lot of rounds of antibiotics in my life for reasons besides skin, and I've had fungal issues arise after doing so. I took several rounds in 2017, the year prior to the CCs starting. So, I wouldn't be surprised if it was fungal. I do see your point in saying I shouldn't put all my eggs in one basket because I totally agree. In the beginning I was so fixated on Fungal acne, but I'm opening up to more options which is part of the reason for this post! So I guess I shouldn't be surprised if it's not fungal! However, I like the idea of keeping an FA safe routine since it keeps it simple, and a lot of actives which can help treat both regular and fungal acne are safe which is awesome. I'm just waiting on that scrape, hopefully I'll have updates soon! &amp;#x200B; As for listing the treatments, do you mean on the post, or just to brainstorm options? &amp;#x200B; I think you're totally right about doing treatments one at a time. In the past I've gotten so impatient about waiting to incorporate new products. Even now in knowing better, my initial thought is \"I don't wanna keep waiting! Why don't I just drop this and try something else?\" Marathon, marathon, marathon. I will take that advice. Like with what you said about Finacea, I've actually stopped using Stridex for a couple of weeks now, so with what you said I might just stick with Finacea through the rest of the month and see how that goes. Think I should update my routine? I'll definitely get differin out of my head until I go to the derm. &amp;#x200B; I also really appreciate what you said about when I get dryness because despite what you said about knowing my skin well (thank you btw, such an affirming thing to hear) I actually haven't realized that! I've switched between actives and no actives without noticing much of a difference besides more clogged skin when I don't use them, yet I've still had an internal dilemma about using them with seeing so many posts about moisture barriers and dehydration! &amp;#x200B; I really appreciate your insights! I will definitely be taking your advice &lt;33 &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;<scumteam14>: Hey, sorry for the late response! &gt; About the FA, my main justification for this is that I've taken a lot of rounds of antibiotics in my life for reasons besides skin, and I've had fungal issues arise after doing so. Oh that makes sense!! Yeah your justification for that seems very sound, and keeping it simple seems like the best way to go about it regardless! &gt;As for listing the treatments, do you mean on the post, or just to brainstorm options? Just to brainstorm! I wanted to make sure I hit all the things you had already tried before suggesting something, plus it's always good to keep track &gt;yet I've still had an internal dilemma about using them with seeing so many posts about moisture barriers and dehydration! Haha very much the same thing here - I love that the sub generally has an excess of caution because it balances out some of that \"I'll *make* my skin obey me - the burn means it's working!\" mentality, but it's easy to get a bit *too* scared of actives. You should never be scared of skincare - as long as you know what signs to watch out for and listen to your skin, you'll be good! Especially for topical daily routines, damage doesn't slam you like a freight train, it tends to slowly accumulate. So as long as you can recognize \"Hmm, that moisturizer isn't supposed to sting....it's not so bad, but maybe I should skip a day or two for my actives\", you're golden!", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 1.8}

A fellow Pinoy redditor :) we have a good community going on over at r/beautytalkph but I can help you out here. If your face feels dry after cleansing, your cleanser might be too harsh. Cetaphil is a bar soap with a pH and eskinol has a lot of drying alcohol, so that's probably why. You can try switching to the gentler **Celeteque Acne Cleansing Gel** and see how your face feels after each wash :) The Laneige is very hydrating na, but if your face seems tight pa rin after using it, you can look at alternatives at Watsons :) based on your skin type, I'd recommend **Cosrx Oil-Free moisturizing lotion, Cetaphil lotion, or the Celeteque Acne Clearing Gel Moisturizer.** Don't be afraid of moisturizer just cause your skin is oily! If your skin is dehydrated, putting moisture back in your skin may tell your oil glands to stop producing sebum. Anyway, cleanser and moisturizer should be enough to get you started. Hyperpigmentation will fade on its own, but you can speed it up with Vitamin C products like **The Ordinary 30% Vitamin C or Melano CC in Shopee, and Mad Hippie Vitamin C in Healthy Options**.

However, in the process of searching for a retinol there were lots of recommendations to try Peter Thomas Roth's Retinol Fusion, which is a **1.5%** ***microencapsulated*** **retinol** product. So my question is... what is the difference between the retinol and microencapsulated retinol? I thought that 1% retinol was the highest retinol percentage available in the United States without a prescription. So this encapsulated retinol must be different, and I guess it must be less effective? Both kinds are listed as the same thing in the ingredient list (simply \"Retinol\"). There seemed to be confusion about this in the threads I was reading, too. Maybe this is a mystery that can't be solved, or someone more knowledgeable can help me understand the difference. Thank you!<scumteam14>: I'm not the most knowledgeable on this, but microencapsulated retinol is literally encapsulated retinol - so it has a little sphere / comfy little coat around it. This helps for a slow, controlled release of retinol over time as the capsule breaks down. Microencapsulated retinol has the pros of being more stable than regular retinol (has a longer shelf life) and being gentler since absorption is spread out over time rather than all at once. I'm not sure if any retinol gets lost in this process or if microencapsulated retinol products have higher concentrations simply because they can / it's less irritating. Also, I'm generally confused about the highest concentration of retinol you can have in the U.S. - there are a few 2.5% retinol products on amazon that seem to use retinol (rather than the usual method of using retinyl palmitate.) Does anyone have a source for max concentration?<ticklystarlight>: I tried to look up the max concentration of retinol for the US and I couldn't find anything. Instead I just got lost in an click-hole trying to find out more about encapsulated retinol. It's actually my thought that encapsulated retinol contains less retinol than just the pure stuff. For example \"1.5% encapsulated retinol\" (which is how PTR is marketed) probably means that the encapsulation material is being included in the percentage, if that makes sense. But I have no way to tell what it's being encapsulated with (although some people here: https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/comment/16501#Comment_16501, seem to say that it's technically a dispersion not an encapsulation) and how much actual retinol molecules are contained in the product. So maybe that's why they can get away with a higher percentage... it's not pure retinol. Anyway it's all very confusing and I'm left feeling really exhausted by just trying to figure out how to navigate retinol/retinoid products....", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 3.6666666667}

What are the desired results of an AHA? I have sensitive skin, so I've only used DERMA E's Overnight Peel and Farmacy's Honeymoon Glow inconsistently at best in the last four months. I'm finally up to using Honeymoon Glow twice per week, but I've only been at this level for two weeks. I still can't apply it on the skin between my nose and mouth because it stings too much. It no longer stings at all on the rest of my face. I apply it at night after washing and drying my face. I then use DERMA E's Hydrating Night Cream over it. I don't know what difference I'm supposed to see in my skin. Do I need to use an AHA longer? Use the DERMA E one more often? It's a lower percentage, so I assume that means it can be used for frequently. Try a different AHA product all together?<nemicolopterus>: Haha why are you using it if you don't know what its doing? What are your skin goals? <bellebrita>: My skin goal is just to have healthy skin. Preventing noticeable aging would be nice, but I consider physical appearance as secondary to skin health. My dermatologist told me a year ago to stop using physical exfoliators because my skin is too sensitive. (It didn't used to be this sensitive). So last winter I mostly stopped using them, with the occasional gentle use as a spot treatment if I had a dry, flaky patch. Having very sensitive skin was new to me, so I started reading this sub. I didn't really understand chemical exfoliators, but that recommendation was in line with what my derm said. Around maybe July or August, I received first the DERMA E product and then the Farmacy product to try out (I get a lot of PR samples), so I slowly added them to my routine. I just don't know if there's supposed to be some obvious physical result, or if it's just one of those things that contributes to overall skin health. <nemicolopterus>: I don't think exfoliating is necessary for overall skin health at all actually. Exfoliants are usually used to treat problems like acne. Hydration and moisturizing are the proper ways to treat flaking. the sub doesnt recommend chemical exfoliation in all cases: just says it's better than physical exfoliation. I'd look at the rest of your routine for your hydrating and moisturizing products and focus on that especially if you're getting dry patches. Niacinamide is great for protecting your moisture barrier as are ceramides. These are commonly found in moisturizers. <bellebrita>: Isn't exfoliating a big part of getting rid of dead skin? That's why I figured it was part of overall skin health. I'll reevaluate my moisturizers once winter really hits. I live in a humid climate with mild winters, so I haven't had dry patches since February. Thank you for your help!<nemicolopterus>: My understanding is that if your skin is healthy the turnover happens naturally without excess flaking or dryness. I'd look at LabMuffin who writes science-based skincare info that's accessible and backed up by research: https://labmuffin.com/its-the-lab-muffin-guide-basic-skincare/ If your skin is dry, you likely need to add oil, and if it's dehydrated you need to add moisture. AHA is drying so doesn't help with either!<maewen27>: I'm not 100% sure (I'm having trouble finding a proper reference), but I thought that AHAs can actually help with moisturizing? This has been my experience, at least! \"If you have dry skin, you\u2019ll also find glycolic particularly useful, because it draws moisture to the skin and helps prevent transepidermal water loss. It also increases the hyaluronic acid levels in the skin.\" <https>://www.dermstore.com/blog/hydroxy-acids-what-they-do-and-which-ones-are-right-for-you/<nemicolopterus>: Whoa weird! I've never heard of that. I use lactic acid as my AHA so maybe there is also a difference depending on which specific one you're using? Here's what I've found so far: &gt; Twelve percent glycolic acid in water and 0.1% retinoic acid in ethanol, respectively, were applied for 60 min once daily, over a period of 2 weeks (5 consecutive days weekly) on dansyl chloride-labelled skin and on untreated skin. During a 10-day application period, both glycolic acid and retinoic acid similarly induced a significant increase in Trans-Epidermal Water Loss. [src](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8651024) i.e., both retin-a and glycolic acid dried the skin out. This might be a function of me being imprecise with my language though: all AHAs I've tried have really irritated my skin (they make it red, flaky, sensitive, etc). When I have dry skin it feels the same way but maybe I'm really conflating two different experiences. On the other hand, [this study](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/9kgypf/research_sidebar_research_threads_week_4_ahas/e71lhk7/) found no difference in skin surface hydration between 40% glycolic acid and a placebo peel. And [this study](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/9kgypf/research_sidebar_research_threads_week_4_ahas/e6zyjof/) did show an increase in hyaluronic acid in the skin (though it's not 100% clear to me that that's the same thing as \"less dryness\"). [Here's a few more studies](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/9kgypf/research_sidebar_research_threads_week_4_ahas/e72hdvx/) showing increase in hyaluronic acid in the skin as well. <Anyway>: this may be another thing of \"YMMV\": for me, AHA is soooo irritating and the redness, flaking, and irritation seems like my skin gets dry but of course that may not be true for everyone!<maewen27>: So interesting, thank you for looking up all these studies! I agree, this is almost definitely a YMMV situation. Glycolic acid is certainly not for everyone!", "num_messages": 10, "avg_score": 2.8}

The cicapair line is incredible! But you can sometimes find them on other websites cheaper. And Fresh\u2019s Kumbacha Essence was expensive, but has kept my skin so hydrated and seemingly poreless since I started using it that I\u2019ll never go without it now. <rlsleepingbeauty>: I recently got dr jarts ceramidin cream and it was a total miss for me \ud83d\ude2d I was so sad but I am all for trying the cicapair line! Is there a certain product from the line you recommend?<snicole1173>: I use the whole line, but I love the serum - it heals my skin in just a day or two if I have pimples or have done extractions. The overnight mask is my favorite occlusive product too, I rarely use a moisturizer now bc it keeps my skin super hydrated even using just twice a week. I use the correction treatment on really bad face days but it\u2019s a little thick/greasy bc of the sunscreen so it\u2019s not my favorite.<rlsleepingbeauty>: Ohh!! So it does heal pimples? For some reason I assumed this would bring everything to the surface. To be clear, you\u2019re referring to cicapair serum right? Not ceramidin liquid.. ? Wow your lucky, I need a moisturizer, my skin is a thirsty beast. Maybe incorporating a sleeping mask will do me wonders, thanks for your suggestions, seriously!! <snicole1173>: Yeah, the cicapair serum. The main ingredient (centella asiatica) is healing/soothing. It\u2019s really good for redness too but I\u2019ve seen the biggest difference in the healing of my acne/skin! You\u2019re welcome!! Once I found products that kept my skin hydrated (I live in the desert so that was a process, but like 80oz of water a day helps as does using my HA while in the shower so it can pull that moisture in instead of pulling it from my skin) I haven\u2019t found a huge need for moisturizer more than once or twice a week under the sleeping mask. Good luck!! <rlsleepingbeauty>: Omg yesssss thank you so much for recommending this. My skin loves Centella and I haven\u2019t found a good product that contains it!! I also drink so much water so that\u2019s no problem for me! Crazy hydrated on the inside, chronically dehydrated on the outside lol. Ohhhh you\u2019re in a dry climate! I\u2019m in a humid climate \ud83d\ude2c do you still think cicapair serum would work despite this? Also, could you explain how you use the HA in the shower in a little more detail? I\u2019m really intrigued by this cause the steam I\u2019m sure really opens your ores and allows your skin to absorb it better/deeper. Great idea!<snicole1173>: I don\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t work! Just let it soak in for a bit if you know you\u2019re going to sweat a lot. So, bc HA uses the water around it (it can and does pull moisture/water out of your deeper skin layers if you don\u2019t give it any to use) using a mist before and after helps a lot, as does putting it on before the shower bc the steam and the water gives it more to pull in and use. I read about it on here months ago and swear by it now!<rlsleepingbeauty>: Wow this is crazy cool. So you put the mist on before the shower or the HA?<snicole1173>: If I\u2019m not taking a shower I spray the mist before and after the HA. If I take a shower I don\u2019t spray any. :)<rlsleepingbeauty>: Wow thank you. So just to be clear, when you use it in the shower, how are you applying it? Putting it into your hands and patting into the skin or letting it sit and absorb the moisture/water? Also, do you layer this in the shower?<snicole1173>: You\u2019re so welcome!! I pat it on and give it enough time to soak in before getting in the shower, and just try to keep my face from getting super wet so it doesn\u2019t rinse off. If my skin is extra dry I\u2019ll add another layer when I get out and let my face air dry. <rlsleepingbeauty>: This is genius, I\u2019m going to try this, thanks so much!!", "num_messages": 13, "avg_score": 2.2307692308}

Let me know if any of you have any suggestions as to how I can incorporate any of the products in the above link into my routine (also in the link above). <saucylackey>: Could you give us a little bit more info about your skin, and the problems you\u2019re trying to address?<ShemomedjamoShorty>: My skin is normal, with a very oily nose. I\u2019m drying to address redness, dullness, and pigmentation. <saucylackey>: Gotcha. I can't in good faith recommend the TO niacinamide because it's causing problems like redness, irritation, and breakouts for so many people. The amount of niacinamide in that product is just obscenely high. As for the rest of the actives, you can just use them on a rotating basis. Keep in mind that they may cause you to purge. So here's your current evening routine: 1. Philosophy - Facial Cleansing Gel 2. Thayer\u2019s Witch Hazel 3. ACTIVE 4. Dr. Dennis Gross - Hyaluronic Marine Eye Gel 5. First Aid Beauty - Ultra Repair Cream And here's a way you can rotate your actives: * Monday: Herbivore * Tuesday: Lactic * Wednesday: ALA * Thursday: Herbivore * Friday: Lactic * Saturday: Herbivore * Sunday: AHA + BHA Peel You're going to need to have very robust skin to pull this many actives off. Personally I would just commit to one (either the lactic, ALA, or AHA + BHA peel) but you do you. Good luck, and let me know if you have any q's.<ShemomedjamoShorty>: Thank you so much! I appreciate your in depth response. Which one would you recommend committing to?<saucylackey>: You're so welcome! For your concerns, probably the lactic because you can work up to using it daily (the ALA and AHA + BHA shouldn't be used more than once or twice a week). Alternatively, you can use the lactic six days a week, and rotate the ALA and AHA + BHA on the seventh day. <Example>: Week 1 * Monday: Lactic * Tuesday: Lactic * Wednesday: Lactic * Thursday: Lactic * Friday: Lactic * Saturday: Lactic * Sunday: ALA Week 2 * Monday: Lactic * Tuesday: Lactic * Wednesday: Lactic * Thursday: Lactic * Friday: Lactic * Saturday: Lactic * Sunday: AHA + BHA Peel<ShemomedjamoShorty>: Do you have any products that you would recommend incorporating into my morning routine?<saucylackey>: Nope, it's a really solid morning routine. Although I wonder if some of the essential oils and fragrances could be contributing to your redness.<ShemomedjamoShorty>: I wondered the same thing, however I\u2019ve had the same redness and discoloration since before I started using those products. One more question - would you recommend using any retinoids? I don\u2019t have any experience using them, but I\u2019ve heard wonderful things <saucylackey>: A retinoid could absolutely be helpful. If you were to go that route, I would recommend seeing a derm (OTC retinoids aren't nearly as effective as prescription ones IMO) and dropping all the other actives. You won't need them with something like a low does of Tret. Keep the questions coming if you have more, I don't mind :)<ShemomedjamoShorty>: Thank you so much! Do you have any eye creams you would recommend? The one I use is nice, but it\u2019s about $50 for .5 oz. <saucylackey>: You're welcome! I actually don't use an eye cream, but here are two much-loved and slightly less expensive dupes to the one you're currently using: [https://www.origins.com/product/15348/11641/skincare/treat/eye-care/ginzing/refreshing-eye-cream-to-brighten-and-depuff](https://www.origins.com/product/15348/11641/skincare/treat/eye-care/ginzing/refreshing-eye-cream-to-brighten-and-depuff) [https://www.clinique.com/product/1683/4769/skin-care/eye-lip-care/all-about-eyes](https://www.clinique.com/product/1683/4769/skin-care/eye-lip-care/all-about-eyes) &amp;#x200B; You could also try applying [this](http://www.hadalabotokyo.com/product/skin-plumping-gel-cream/) to damp skin right after cleansing, and taking it up around your eye area. Then just let your skin air dry and go in with your FAB moisturizer.<ShemomedjamoShorty>: Thank you so much for your help! For curiosities sake, if I were to use the ordinary 10% Niacinamide serum, where would I incorporate it? And can I use with vitamin C?<saucylackey>: There's controversy about mixing those two together, although I don't think the science backs it up (you can read more about it [here](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/myths/can-niacinamide-and-vitamin-c-be-used-together.html)). However, TO specifically states not to mix their niacinamide serum with vitamin C. So my inclination would be to use vitamin C in the AM and niacinamide in the PM. Something like this: <Morning>: 1. Philosophy - Facial Cleansing Gel 2. Thayer\u2019s Witch Hazel 3. Youth to the People - Kale + Tripeptide 5 Vitamin C Hyaluronic Acid 4. Dr. Dennis Gross - Hyaluronic Marine Eye Gel 5. First Aid Beauty - Ultra Repair Cream 6. Dermalogica - SPF 50 <Evening>: 1. Philosophy - Facial Cleansing Gel 2. Thayer\u2019s Witch Hazel 3. Lactic Acid 4. Niacinamide 5. Dr. Dennis Gross - Hyaluronic Marine Eye Gel 6. First Aid Beauty - Ultra Repair Cream<ShemomedjamoShorty>: Do you think I could use it after the Prism Herbivore Acid or the AHA + BHA as well? <saucylackey>: I wouldn't use anything after the peel. 30% AHA is no joke. You'll definitely want to baby your skin after that. Same with the ALA. Using it after the Herbivore acid should be okay because it doesn't contain topical vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid). But I'm not a derm, so always proceed with caution and listen to your skin.", "num_messages": 16, "avg_score": 1.0625}

Wash face with cleanser/tap water and use a moisturiser. Stuff required: Drinkable water, tap water and moisturiser. How to do: Same steps as level 1, but smear moisturiser on your face. I recommend: A hydrating facial mist. I use one from Eucerin, so it takes me 3 seconds to spritz and my hands won\u2019t be greasy. Then I go back to sleep. <Rationale>: It\u2019s just adding one more step to the previous routine. Except you\u2019re hydrating on the outside in addition to the inside. Good job! \u2014 [Level 3 - Yup, I can make it through today at least.] <Routine>: Spot treatment and/or sunscreen, in addition to whatever\u2019s in level 2. Stuff required: Products for any skin specific issues you have, and a good sunscreen. Drinkable water, tap water and moisturiser. I recommend: Tinted sunscreen. I use one from The Face Shop, which is also a BB cream and facial primer. I also use an oil cleanser to remove my sunscreen. Sometimes I use a non-tinted thin sunscreen from a local brand, so I can avoid the oil cleansing, which is one more step and product to my routine and Budget. Never used a miscellar cleanser myself but I think it\u2019ll do double duty of removing both makeup and basic cleaning? <Rationale>: At this stage I feel that I should introduce sunscreen because it\u2019s an investment in your future. The future is usually not important when you\u2019re not sure if you can survive the day. But today you can. \u2014 [Bonus Level - I\u2019m alright for the time being.] I recommend: Whatever you want, whenever you want to do it, in your own terms. I usually just try to unlegbeard myself. <Rationale>: Cherish this burst of energy and clarity and do whatever the fuck you want. You know this is transient, so all the more you should account to yourself. \u2014 Well, I hope this is helpful to those that read it. I understand to some this is a no-brainer. But it\u2019s very hard for those struggling to differentiate between normality (yeah I\u2019m lazy today so I\u2019m going to chill) and inadequacy (I cant even do this simple thing!). I share this really from lived experience. I tend to incline towards level 1, something like 20 days a month. Sometimes even without meeting the 2Ls of water I set for myself/recommended water consumption. However, I feel that if I must compel myself do something for self care, I prefer to incorporate a step that\u2019s more holistic like drinking water. When I feel slightly better, I try to prioritise. But I find the first step is just not to trivialise myself and others. With my disposition which dislikes anything that can be termed motivational, I just want to end this post by saying that you are all sufficient. Thank you for sharing your problems and advice on this sub. I learned a lot.<meowgrrr>: I love neutrogena cleansing towelettes in general, they really just work for my skin, but I love them even more because I just keep the pack next to my bed so when Im depressed and/or drunk I can grab a wipe from in bed and wipe my face and not have to worry about getting up and going to the sink. It cleans and it also makes my face feel dewy and moisturized. If not the neutrogena cleansing cloths, there are so many brands out there with wipes I bet there is a good option for everyone! <ooh_cake>: Wipes, pads like Stridex, and sprays really come in handy on those days when my physical and/or mental health is acting up.<afro__ditee>: This. I have a jar of toner pads (the neogen cica ones) that I keep specifically for low spoon days and traveling. They're the best tbh.", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 125.5}

I posted countless questions on this sub, just check my post history. My derm was confused and so was I. After 2 years NOTHING has worked and my skin looks like all sorts of things - seb derm, acne vulgaris, eczema, rosacea, subtype 2 rosacea, PIE etcetcetcetc During my last derm visit I dropped the topic of pityrosporum possibility. She was reluctant and dismissive. I was fed up with everything she ever perscribed me with no improvement, so much money wasted on pills (I\u2019m off of them after 18 months!) and appointments and perscriptions. I was doubtful since the beginning as she would diagnose me with just her eyesight. But I was done. She said she\u2019d let me come in a week to have skin biopsy done to see the fungal possibilities. I WAS RIGHT!!! There has been pityrosporum found upon examining the sample of my skin under the microscope as well as demodex! These two fuckers are finally out in the light! It\u2019s just step one but after 2-3 years of blind guessing and not being sure of the fuck was my skin so resistant to everything we finally know the cause!! Just PSA: the sampling was uncomfortable. I felt like the lab guy literally scraped my skin to the meat with his little knife. He scraped the inside of my cheek and the side of my nose to get the sample. I was told not to moisturize or use anything but cleanser three full days prior so the results would be accurate. I felt like my skin was bleeding and out in the open after the process - when I looked in the mirror it was slightly red and the small papule was minorly damaged so it was a relief! Now that I\u2019m finallyyyyyyy sure of the root cause, I\u2019m curious of your opinions on my perscriptions to treat pityrosporum and demodex my derm has given me. I\u2019m supposed to use 20% miconazole cream and a topical antibiotic that I dont remember the name of for theee weeks on affected areas (inner cheeks and t-zone and wherever I possibly get a blemish), every night in turns. So mornings would be cleanse &amp; moisturize (and spf if I\u2019m out) and nights would cleanse &amp; be those two things, one night miconazole, other night topical antibiotic for three weeks. Then I\u2019ll have a checkup. Does that sound good? Tbh I\u2019m scared as I\u2019ve had no successes all this time from things perscribed by my derm, lots of which had fragrance and esters and other nonesense. I wasn\u2019t told what to use after those three weeks, guess we\u2019ll disciss that at the checkup. But I\u2019m afraid to even start those two perscriptions. Do any of you have experiences with pityrosporum and/or demodex and miconazole/antibiotic to treat them? I thought about just getting sulfur self-initiatively. Either from the get-go (aka not even trying the perscriptions) or using it after thise 3 weeks for maintenence. Opinions??<PollyM16>: I haven't gone through your previous posts but I have a question - have you been around puppies at all?<booster-and-snifits>: I would be interested in knowing why you ask. This may answer a few of my skin issues as well. <PollyM16>: Demodex is pretty much universal and all baby puppies have an overgrowth of it until their immune system starts to mature and, of course, demodex has long been suspected in rosacea. I didn't have rosacea until my first litter. Sometime after they were born I noticed my skin looked different and when the redness didn't go away and started looking worse, I went to my PCP. She's not a derm but she is really good on skin issues. She diagnosed rosacea. I got the metrogel but I didn't think it helped, I stopped using it. But eventually the rosacea went away. I don't know why it went away and I can't even say when. My first litter was in 2005, I've had two more since without the redness coming back. Maybe I'm taking better care of my skin, maybe my immune system learned not to react, I don't know. My theory is that since canine demodex isn't the same as human, it was going to go away eventually. And I've always suspected that I'm part dog, so I was susceptible to the puppy demodex. ;-) Right now I'm pretty sure I have an overgrowth in my eyelashes. It's normal for most of us to have demodex, it's the overgrowth that causes problems (my eyelashes are itchy). I'm curious if the OP was around puppies and maybe got demodex from them (we all put puppies up to our faces, don't we?), which started her problems. Since it's normal to have demodex, I wonder if the scrapings showed an overgrowth or a normal amount? And, of course, demodex are mites. Tiny creeping bugs. The pityrosporum is a fungus. I was prescribed metrogel (metronidazole, for rosacea) and the OP has miconozole. Metronidazole is an antibiotic and antiprotozoan; it's used to treat rosacea, yeast infections, giardia, and many other things. Miconozole is an antifungal used to treat pityrosporum and other things (athlete's foot, yeast, ringworm) according to WebMD (I just looked it up, I'd never heard of it before tonight). klaudippidy, I think your derm is concentrating on the pityrosporum, which is probably the right thing to do. The demodex were probably on your skin anyway. Maybe you have an overgrowth of demodex but maybe that's because of the pityrosporum. I do not think sulfur is a good idea! It is very harsh and your skin needs to heal. Your immune system has to help get rid of this stuff and sulfur is NOT going to help. Just my musings. I wish you good luck. I think you should follow your derm's advice and not go off on your own on this. In three weeks, I hope you get good news! By the way, do your eyelashes itch? This just started yesterday and it's bugging me! ;-)", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 17.25}

I alternate the rose toner and the Hado Labo three times each in my toner step. I use the rose toner just to give the hado labo something to cling to. The Aquaphor has been the best godamn purchase to keep my dry skin in check. I slather this on as a final step. It used to somewhat difficult to find in Ireland but it\u2019s more accessible now and I find it superior to vaseline which is cumbersome to apply.

Adjustment or breakout? So, before I begin, I want to thank everyone on this subreddit because I have learned so much through all of your posts. So much to the point that I think I know more than my dermatologist (only kidding, but sometimes). Anyway I'm a 25 year old male who had amazing clear skin up until last yr. I initially started to break out on my cheek with single large painful cystic bumps taking weeks to heal. Earlier this yr I decided to start using stridex pads and made the mistake of not easing into it and instead just starting to use them 2x a day from the start. I powered through the purge but my skin started to burn anytime I put water on it and I soon realized I was over-exfoliating. I took a break from all facial treatments for 2 months and last week started the oil cleansing method using grapeseed oil and just bought argon oil to start using as a moisturizer. I have done months of research and I know there is an adjustment period when it comes to OCM. However, I'm starting to get concerned because I seem to be getting these very small bumps since starting OCM, but my bigger cystic acne is actually resolving. I just wanted to know did anyone with success have a \"purge\" (I know that idea is only used for actives) or period where closed comedones came to head? I have a small number of closed comedones come to head and some grits as well so I'm torn as it seems to be working but it also seems to be making things worse. I would love to hear from people who found success with OCM and went through an adjustment period. Thank you very much to anyone who replies. I appreciate it all.<lyndsbae>: My face \u201cpurged\u201d for about four weeks with the oil cleansing method. I have dry skin though, and my biggest concern was my painful dry patches. When my skin was \u201cpurging,\u201d it seemed like I had blackheads everywhere. It eventually went away, and now my skin feels great after every cleanse. If you can wait through it, you may really like oil cleansing.<MindMyOpinion>: I think I will stick with it for at least 30 days and see how it goes. Every morning I wake up and my skin looks amazing but when I get super close to the mirror I see really small bumps. I know in the real world people won't be that close to me, but I also know that's not normal. Anyway, thank you so much for the input.", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 3.0}

I went to a dermatologist and what she prescribed made it soo worse and sooo inflamed. It\u2019s itchy and literally aches all day long. I feel like everything makes it\u2019s worse and nothing helps I don\u2019t know what to do. routine in the comments <nodiggity__>: My skin looks exactly like yours! Went from crystal clear to itchy, painful, inflamed acne in less than 2 years and nothing has helped me, only made my acne worse. I suspect mine is FA related from browsing reddit and coming across the Simple Science Skincare blog. Just curious, have you tried the FA routine yet and if so, any improvements at all?<ihave15fansinmyroom>: I used the vanicream facewash and saw a HUGE difference in my forehead acne, literally over night the little bumps went away. I used cerave moisture cream. And it helped my really really dry spots. The ones on my chin, not so much though. For those I basically stopped everything I was doing. I stopped taking vitamins, stopped birth control, stopped my probiotics, switched detergents and stopped wearing makeup. And those got soooooooo much better. My face doesn\u2019t itch like it used to and the acne is not swollen and it doesn\u2019t hurt like it did. I\u2019m still planning on going to the derm for it. I have probably 75% less acne but it\u2019s still more than most people. <nodiggity__>: Wow 75% reduction in 1 month is amazing! Congrats on that, I am hoping - better yet, praying mine is actually FA because I went and bought all the stuff today including detergent so I hope I can see a change like you too. I did a Head &amp; Shoulders mask last night, and I found that all of the red bumps came to head in the morning and I was probably 90% less itchy so fingers crossed its a good sign. I'm also thinking of stopping all my supplements too (currently on Probiotics, Zinc, Magnesium, &amp; Vit D). And I want to go to a Derm just to get a culture and confirm if it is really FA or not. <ihave15fansinmyroom>: The ones on my chin were big and INCREDIBLY painful and they\u2019re practically nonexistent now, just small little Whiteheads and I still have small ones on my forehead but again whiteheads and nothing they were! I hope everything goes well! I think the thing that helped the most was the detergent. I got dye free and scent free and the next morning my skin was less painful and red! <nodiggity__>: Wow amazing how 1 change can make such a difference! My case of acne is literally identical to yours. I've been doing the Nizoral/Head &amp; Shoulders mask for 2 days and my itching is gone and my forehead is getting smoother. And I washed everything with a clean detergent last night. However, I woke up with huge painful bumps under my chin again this morning so it really set me back. Have you been doing masks every night? What skin product do you think has made the most difference to you? <ihave15fansinmyroom>: I got an exfoliating mask, the ole henriksen 2-1 polishing sugar mask (I got it on sale at tj maxx lol) but exfoliating has helped a lot too! I like the dermae exfoliate as well. I try not to do mask just bc I found a routine that works and I don\u2019t want to anger my skin lol. The vanicream face wash really helped! I\u2019m now using the la roche-posey effeclar purifying foaming gel cleanser for oily skin and it\u2019s helped!! The best advice I have for you is to give it time, I was so focused on my acne that I think the stress made it worse! I hope you find something that works for you!<nodiggity__>: Ya stress is a huge factor for me. I stress about my acne and then I get more, so it's a neverending cycle. :( I'm two days in with masking with the H &amp; S and Nizoral and I feel like my skin is kind of better but also kind of worse. Like the existing acne I have is smaller (except for my chin which is huge and painful), but I feel like more bumps have surfaced. Did you go though some kind of purge in the beginning? I am not sure if I should continue with this or stop. Sorry for all the questions, its just your acne is so so similar to mine so it's nice to hear some feedback <ihave15fansinmyroom>: It\u2019s okay! Maybe don\u2019t put the H&amp;S and nizoral on your chin? That may be making it worse. Also I used pure aloe Vera gel as a mask to soothe my big cystic pimples and take the pain away. I don\u2019t remember that bad of a purge, my acne got smaller and less painful immediately.

In short, the natural pH of our skin should be 4-5.5, the slight acidity of our skin is one of the mechanisms that help prevent the growth of harmful bacteria on your skin. Cleansers with a pH level of 5-5.5 are generally what I have seen recommended. There is a spreadsheet list available in the resource that I linked which compares the pH of a bunch of different cleansers. The one that I personally use is the Missha Near Skin pH balancing cleanser, it's not very widely talked about but in my experience, it has been gentle and helped clear up my breakouts. &amp;#x200B; I have also head a lot good things about [Avene](https://www.aveneusa.com/) products for sensitive skin.

And great direction with the links. <Ioanna_Malfoy>: Hope to hear an update at some point about how your skin journey is going (you know, for secondhand hope through somebody else finding success even when I\u2019m still looking for it)<BisonBeastie>: So I changed my cleanser to the Vanicream Gentle Cleanser but I'm finding that it doesn't take makeup off very well. I tried some different oils but I'm having to rub the oil (cold cream, Vaseline, or coconut oil) off my skin to really get the makeup of to cleanse :( leaves my skin red and raw feeling. I guess I could do no makeup but I feel ashamed of my skin rn. Vicious cycle. I also changed to the CeraVe Moisturizer in a tub and really like the feel of that. Still using Vaseline on top of that at night and loving the results. I'm still breastfeeding which still affects my hormones a lot so I'm sure my recent breakouts are a result of that. I'm sorry you are having issues too. I get so sick of having to figure out what I'm doing wrong.<Ioanna_Malfoy>: I hope it works out for you and congrats on the baby! Also for taking off makeup you might enjoy an emulsifying oil cleanser. You put it on your face dry, rub in to dissolve makeup, add a little water, keep rubbing as the oil emulsifies, and rinse. It should remove you makeup and wash off clean without any scrubbing! The main thing I\u2019ve had to watch out for is getting one that doesn\u2019t sting my eyes. A really popular one is the Banila Co. Clean It Zero. I\u2019ve tried the Nourishing version and enjoyed it. The only thing I don\u2019t like is that it\u2019s a solid balm and is stored in a jar. But that\u2019s mostly only an issue for me because it\u2019s a bit hard to store the jar within armsreach from my bathtub. But because of that I\u2019ve been using the Klavuu Pure Pearlsation Divine Pearl Cleansing Oil which is a liquid that comes in a handy pump bottle. I\u2019ve really enjoyed it (it also has a subtle vanilla scent that I find relaxing) although it\u2019s a bit more expensive than the Banila one. There are tons of other good emulsifying oils too, those are just the two that I\u2019ve tried and liked. I\u2019m also a frustrated with trying to figure out my skin. Six months ago, I had a few occasional zits but my main problem was some scarring from adolescent acne. But now I have constant red, angry break outs on my cheeks and jaw. The precipitating factor was a terrible cleanser that I used for about 3 months (I have no idea why it took me that long to realize what was the problem) but even since I quit using that cleanser about a month ago, my skin still hasn\u2019t calmed down. :/<BisonBeastie>: Is it like dry and angry? That sucks. I used to try different products before I found this subreddit and most of the time I would try a shit load of new things at once and never be able to figure out what was causing the issue. I'm learning to be patient and try one thing at a time. The latest has been applying moisturizer in tiny circles with two fingers (read that somewhere on SA) so that your skin absorbs the moisturizer instead of just sitting on top of my skin. It's actually working and my overall face texture is improving.<Ioanna_Malfoy>: My skin naturally tends more toward the oily side but I\u2019m pretty sensitive to products. So most products designed for acne are too harsh for my skin and it goes dry and flaky. Since I\u2019ve been working on my acne recently I\u2019ve been working to keep my face moisturized, I\u2019ll have to try that technique! Luckily, my break outs seem to have finally started becoming less severe (but I don\u2019t know which product to attribute it to because I\u2019ve been desperately trying so many things)! This subreddit and my bad experience with the cleanser seem to have fueled an unhealthy obsession with skincare products. What do I spend my money on? Skincare products.

Feeling kind of distraught. I am a 22 year old girl, whose 23rd bday is next week. Earlier this week, I woke up to notice crow's feet at the corner of my right eye only, and they have not gone away even though it's been a few days. I am diligent about sunscreen, I use an AHA, and I use Vitamin C (the THD form). Never smoked or touched a drop of alcohol in my life. I probably only drink 16 oz of water a day tho (hate water). They are barely noticeable when I use vaseline (if at all), but after washing my face they come back. I have medium skin (NC40 in MAC). I guess it's kind of upsetting because I thought that with the way my family members have aged (people all peg them as 10 years younger than they are, and none have lines at the corner of their eyes), and my skincare routine, I didn't think I would see such lines so fast. It is interesting too because the crows feet on my right eye are literally the only lines I have on my face (no smile lines, \"11\" lines, etc.). Is this from aging? If so, is it possible to reverse at my age? Why do I only have it on one side?<epipin>: This is probably due to dehydration. If it was aging they would come on gradually and be similar on both sides. If they appear after cleansing, that would be my first suspect - it may be drying you out. Try using something gentler. Then hyaluronic acid containing products are great for boosting water levels. And follow with a more occlusive moisturizer. <leatherart5>: So can it go away? Idk it just bothers me because they came on so suddenly (like...overnight) and haven't gone away since.<epipin>: Yes, it can go away. <leatherart5>: How long would it take, especially at my age?", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 0.8}

Then, I started travelling for six weeks in England/Europe. I\u2019m originally from Ontario, Canada, so the climate and food was quite a bit different. While I was there, my skin broke out majorly. It\u2019s now been over six months since I have gotten home and NOTHING has cleared my skin since then. I stayed with my regular products for a while, then started switching things up to see if it helped. The Body Shop\u2019s tea tree oil products helped bring down my redness, but that was it. I\u2019ve now been on my current routine for about three or so months. My main concerns are acne and scarring. My skin is dry if I don\u2019t moisturize it, especially during winter. I\u2019m still living in cold/dry climate. Here\u2019s my current routine, which is still not giving me the results I want: <Morning>: - FAB Facial Radiance Polish - FAB facial radiance pads - Lush tea tree water toner - Clinique acne solutions clearing gel - Sunday Riley good genes lactic acid treatment - Sunday Riley Tidal moisturizer <Night>: - Spectro cleanser for blemish prone skin - FAB facial radiance pads - Lush tea tree water toner - Sunday Riley Luna night oil Here is what my skin currently looks like on this routine: https://imgur.com/a/NLnCWhL Any advice, product recommendations etc. would be appreciated!<saucylackey>: This looks like you need the help of a derm. Is that possible for you?<diamondvalkyrie_>: It is possible. I\u2019ll just have to get a referral from my doctor to get an appointment with a dermatologist. The process may take a few weeks, as I won\u2019t be able to see my doctor until mid-Jan and then whatever the wait time is for a derm appointment! Will definitely work on getting in to see one. Just not sure what to do in the meantime <saucylackey>: I would definitely encourage you to get the ball rolling on that. Is your forehead clear?<diamondvalkyrie_>: It is! I very rarely/if ever get acne on my forehead and if I do it\u2019s usually just one small zit and not the nightmare that my chin area is. There is some very mild scarring left, but most of that cleared up when I was using a lot of Neutrogena products and it\u2019s hardly noticeable now<saucylackey>: I thought that might be the case. That\u2019s a really strong indication that this is hormonal acne, not product-related acne, in which case there\u2019s not much you\u2019re going to be able to do OTC-wise. It\u2019s probably going to require a prescription or two from a derm. Common treatments include an antibiotic + retinoid, spironolactone, and/or birth control. If I were in your position, I\u2019d be pushing to see a derm as soon as possible, and using a very simple routine with some benzoyl peroxide in the meantime. I like the Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser, CeraVe Moisturizing Cream, and La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo (the U.S. version). I\u2019d also be looking into getting a hormone panel done, just to make sure there\u2019s nothing wonky going on internally. Let me know if you have any q\u2019s.<diamondvalkyrie_>: That definitely makes sense. Does hormonal acne tend to just start happening out of nowhere? I\u2019ve been on the same birth control for a few years now and it didn\u2019t seem to effect my acne at all good or bad. The only thing that changed in this timeline was my travelling, and I got into a new relationship... would that affect my hormones enough to cause acne? <saucylackey>: It can absolutely happen out of nowhere, and it\u2019s important to note that it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything is \u201cwrong.\u201d Natural fluctuations in our cycle that are perfectly healthy can cause things to go awry. That being said, I think it would be a good idea to check in with your gynecologist or GP to make sure that everything is balanced internally. All that requires is a quick blood draw, and you can get results very quickly. If you want to try some lifestyle adjustments, 10 minutes of yoga a day is a great place to start. You don\u2019t have to keep it up forever if it\u2019s not your thing\u2014just think of it like a treatment, to be used when you have an acne flare. If you have access to the brand Yogi Tea, their \u201cGreen Tea Kombucha Decaf\u201d and \u201cWomen\u2019s Moon Cycle\u201d blends are also worth looking into IMO. And of course sleep lots and stay hydrated. Other than that, I think it\u2019s best to stick to a very gentle routine with one active. Benzoyl peroxide is the gold standard for OTC acne treatments, so that\u2019s what I usually recommend. Congrats on the new relationship, that\u2019s wonderful :)<diamondvalkyrie_>: Thank you so much for all of your help!

I want to know all about everyone's experience with this newer type of Vitamin C, which I will refer to as THD. So far, there really hasn't been much research as to how effective this derivative of Vitamin C is in comparison to traditional L-ascorbic acid. From what I have read online, it seems to have brightening effects, is a gentler derivative of Vit C for people who would otherwise be sensitive to it, and there is the claim that it penetrates deeper into the skin as an oil-soluble form. Basically, there's a lot of hype surrounding THD and it's a little too early to be sure about its overall benefits. If you have used a THD Vit C, what was your experience like? If you used other types of Vit C (particularly L-ascorbic acid), how did the THD compare? Other questions: Is THD considered an acid at all? Is pH-dependent? Are there any ingredients you should never layer THD with (like how some would not pair their L-ascorbic acid with niacinamide)?<pazzaglia1>: I've used AA formulations and also tried The Ordinary Vitamin F - I was really under-whelmed. At least for me, it did not lighten or brighten like the AA so I started putting it on my arms to use it up and my arms actually broke out.

Right now I'm using the GOW Vitamin C and I really like it (except for the fact that it smells like hot dog water).

I'm looking to add: * Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 * Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% * Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution * Ascorbic Acid 8% + Alpha Arbutin 2% I've understood that you usually go from lightest to heaviest as far as some product goes, but could really use some additional help here. If any of these contradict I'd love to know. Thanks!<nemicolopterus>: 1. First, pick ONE problem (sun damage, texture, redness, and moisture) and start with something to treat that. Add that one product, patch-testing first, and keep it in your routine for at least a month. Then, pick your next important problem and go with that. Definitely do not add all of these at once! 2. Since you're concerned about sun damage I'm surprised to see you're not wearing sunscreen. It's the number one product to protect your skin! You especially need this if you end up using any exfoliating acid like glycolic. 3. Am I reading this correctly that you only cleanse every 3 days? Why is that? <FrostyHero_>: Yeah I kind of figured putting all of them in was a sin. Let's say I want to start with moisture, would I start with the moisturizing toner? I am not using sun screen right now because I'm not in the sun that much, I was stupid as a teen though and received a few bad sunburns because of it. If I add the glycolic I'll definitely hunt down a sunscreen. I only cleanse that often because I don't wear any makeup and it does make my skin feel tight after. My skin isn't cracking or peeling or anything so would you assume it's safer to use more than that?<nemicolopterus>: Yeah hyaluronic acid is an excellent hydrator! Apply it to damp skin to maximize benefits since hyaluronic acid works by transporting water to deeper layers of your skin. Sunscreen is good anyway, so I always recommend adding it :) Lots of great sunscreens these days! Especially if you're anywhere with direct sunlight it's the best thing you can do for your skin. Ah if your cleanser is making your skin feel tight it's way too harsh for you! Cerave hydrating is generally pretty gentle, so maybe it'll get easier to use once you step up the hydrating. Try that first. If it still feels tight when you wash try something more gentle like oil cleansing (I like hada labo emulsifying oil cleanser because it's easy to wash off), micellar water, or vanicream hydrating cleanser. <FrostyHero_>: I will start with the toner and hopefully it allows me to increase my cleanser usage and move from there! Do you have a nice light sunscreen that you would recommend considering my routine and future goals? I've actually read that just adding a sunscreen can be good for your skins moisture as well. Thanks for taking the time and effort in your replies, I really appreciate it and have already learned from your skin and product knowledge.<nemicolopterus>: Happy to help! Here are all my recs: https://molecule.github.io/post/skincare-and-haircare/ Good luck with the toner!<FrostyHero_>: Very interesting read, I enjoyed that. What do you mean by damp skin? Do I pat my face dry and immediately apply product or is damp skin still wet with water slightly? You're routine seems so advance, time to step up my game it seems. There's a lot in there about Ph levels I don't quite understand yet but a little research will help. Good blog! <Edit>: also would you agree that starting with repairing my moisture barrier is the right move?<nemicolopterus>: I usually pat my face w a towel to remove most of the water but it's still wet: like if I touched my face w a dry finger my finger would get wet. My routine is super advanced. It took me about 4 years to get to this point. Glad it was useful! I'll add more links about pH stuff there, thanks for the feedback! And yes: absolutely repair your moisture barrier first! Good instincts.<FrostyHero_>: Alright, gotcha now. Yeah, I'm hoping restoring my moisture first will help alleviate some of the others and then see what happens. I saw you really liked the Hada Labo toners, would you recommend that over TO or wouldn't matter? I've heard good things about both.<nemicolopterus>: Well I've never tried the TO hydrating products but in general their stuff feels less well-formulated than Hada labo's. Like grittier and doesn't sink in well and clumpy and goopy. I mean it's hard to complain for the price but just not my ideal. And some of their stuff is actually formulated in such a way that it likely won't have any effect at all. If I recall correctly their vitamin c is designed such that it just probably won't deliver much of anything to your skin. Whereas Hada Labo Is a Joy to use and I can immediately feel the difference in my skin. For me part of skincare I guess is the qualitative experience, so enjoying the process is important. Plus their bottles last for a full year of twice daily use which I really appreciate. But TO is cheap and their bottles are glass which is great. Honestly they've kind of revolutionized skincare by making stuff so affordable and by being so accessible with answering questions. I own a lot of TO stuff too! I would only repurchase the rosehip seed oil and the salicylic acid but it was definitely a worthwhile experiment!", "num_messages": 11, "avg_score": 2.1818181818}

Very dry/uncomfortable/tight feeling skin. I would try to put moisturiser on as quickly as possible because it felt awful otherwise, and even with moisturiser it didn't always feel great. What fixed it almost completely for me was using hyaluronic acid (specifically hada loba premium). I didn't really understand the difference between dry skin and dehydrated skin back then (I had dehydrated skin), and hyaluronic acid is amazing for it.<rlsleepingbeauty>: I have this product! How do you personally apply it to your skin? <learningtarot>: I put it on right after I shower, while my face is still wet. I just put some onto my fingers and apply it like that, spreading it so its evenly distributed. I then wait like five minutes or so, before moving on to the rest of my routine, but this isn't always necessary. <rlsleepingbeauty>: Awesome. Thank you so much for your reply :) do you use multiple layers?<learningtarot>: You're welcome! My routine is changing a little bit right now, but this is what it usually is: Wash Face Every other day: BHA stridex, wait 15-30 minutes Hyaluronic acid, wait five minutes (I use this after the stridex on days I use stridex, but it works best right after washing my face) Moisturizer Azelaic acid I don't use any other toners or serums or anything. I tried using argan oil before, but found it didn't do anything for me.<rlsleepingbeauty>: Are you combo skin? This resembles my routine a good amount. Argan oil broke me out! Also thanks for visual of your routine! Makes things a lot easier lol<learningtarot>: I'm more oily/dehydrated than combo. That sucks! I think it might have broke me out a little too, but I stopped using it pretty quickly since I had primarily bought it for my hair anyways.<rlsleepingbeauty>: Haha!! We are similar there, argan oil for my hair is a dream, I love it!! Can I ask what azelaic acid you use?<learningtarot>: I've used both melazepam and the ordinary's azelaic acid. I honestly don't know which I like better. They both have their pros and cons, so its kind of frustrating for me! I actually keep swapping back and forth. Are you using azelaic acid now? If so, what are you using?<rlsleepingbeauty>: I actually am! I have a curology prescription of 0.009 tret, 9% azelaic acid, and clindamycin 1%. I really only use this formulation when I want to use tret, and I started at a lose dose to ease into it. I\u2019ve very sensitive though so I alternate with finacea gel 15% azelaic acid and finacea is hands down he best azelaic acid IMO. The ordinary texture was sooo weird on my skin I couldn\u2019t stand it. Haven\u2019t tried Melazespam only because it is a cream texture and I\u2019m clog prone so I was worried for that reason. You can get the azelaic acid finacea Gel 15% at chemist direct Australia. I live in the US but could never find a derm that would prescribe it for me so I took a risk based on reading thousands of reviews and took the plunge. I really like it, and would recommend.<learningtarot>: Down the road I will definitely look into it, but I'm still trying to find a routine that works for me, and want to fine tune that before I try to get a prescription for it. I live in Canada, and unfortunately azelaic acid can't be sold over the counter here, so I have to order it online from places that don't care about that! I've recently started using Differin (also something that is prescription only here), and working in azelaic acid into my routine has been challenging, but so far the combination has been very effective for me.<rlsleepingbeauty>: Chemist direct Australia, you don\u2019t don\u2019t need a script! You just buy it! Differin is pretty good, I used it before tret but tret really is a work horse!", "num_messages": 13, "avg_score": 1.3076923077}

Are the spots only on your right cheek?<Enitocin1>: Yeah they are but I also have the same issues with my left cheek/temple as well<saucylackey>: Gotcha. Personally I would switch from the CeraVe hydrating cleanser to the foaming one (the brand is very good, but the hydrating cleanser can be problematic for some people), and from the PM moisturizer to the moisturizing cream (the cream is more soothing IMO and dries with a soft matte finish). I would also remove all the \u201cextras\u201d right now and just use a spot treatment in the evening... the La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo is extremely effective (note that it will bleach fabrics like towels and sheets). You can tap a pea-sized amount onto your breakouts every night or every other night, before or after moisturizing (depending on how resilient your skin is). I hope that gives you some ideas.
