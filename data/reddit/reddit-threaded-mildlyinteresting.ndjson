So why did we get rid of the gold standard?<TheSecretMe>: There were 5 million Americans in 1800. There are 327 million Americans today. The US GDP per capita was 0.48$ in 1800. It's about 60.000,- today. The gold standard doesn't have a great growth model. It worked really well in the past because gold doesn't rot, degrade, corrode or otherwise diminish. If you're holding an ounce of gold today, it'll be exactly the same in 200 years from now. And gold is a very finite resource on Earth so it's unlikely someone will suddenly flood the market with so much gold it becomes worthless. Which is also the problem. The global population increased by 700% since the year 1800. Global production and industry grew by even more. The global gold supply has not. If you try to maintain the gold standard, ie. every bit of currency is backed by gold, you're going to severely limit your capacity for economic growth. Increasing populations will produce increasingly more product yet the basis of your economic system is incapable of growth? That's very problematic. I mean what's the bank going to do? Tell people their dollar is worth x amount of gold atoms?<zachintyre>: Hm. Fascinating. How come everyone complains about leaving the gold standard then? Is it because without it, the system has been abused allowing for greater deficit?<TheSecretMe>: The gold standard made people feel safe. In theory, you could walk into any bank, hand them your \"worthless\" paper dollars and walk out with a sack of gold to bury in your backyard. Their worry is that under the current system, either through disaster or ill intent, your money can become worthless. Ie. the bank falls over or society collapses and your dollar is just a piece of paper, nothing more.<zachintyre>: If it gets to that point I\u2019m assuming we\u2019ll have more than a money problem!<TheSecretMe>: Pretty much yeah. Which is exactly why those types of people like gold. They like the idea that if they see it coming, they can exchange their dollars for gold and when things turn to shit, use gold barter material or to store their wealth safely. It's really just a sliding scale towards doomsday prepping. At that point, you might as well say gold is heavy and you can't eat it so just start hoarding food, water and tools instead. As an aside, gold is used as an alternative to investments. The nature of gold (finite, doesn't degrade etc.) means that gold is useful as a value store. If you buy an ounce of gold today, it won't increase or decrease much in value over time. When times are stable, people love to invest. You basically put your money into industry and innovation and enjoy the rewards of the growth you've funded with your money. Investments don't like risk though. Risk makes investment unpredictable, you might lose your money instead of earning a return on investment. During unpredictable times like wartime, political upheaval or times with a lot of potential for natural disaster, people don't want to take risks. And that's when gold becomes interesting. You exchange your money for gold and it's relatively safe. Sure you won't earn much return on investment for your gold hoard but it's safe and stable. You're not losing money on risk. When times stabilise and industry and innovation pick up again, sell the gold and invest your money again.<insidezone64>: You've elucidated precisely why gold is a lousy investment, though. It is finite, and it does not create more of itself. The central idea of investment is for your money to work for you and continue to create more money. This does not happen with gold. An ounce of gold is still an ounce of gold 5, 10, 20 years later. Unlike investments in stocks or bonds, which can pay a dividend, and create even more wealth, gold just sits there.. In an investment, your money is working for you and creating more value. Gold and other commodities do not do that. Gold only increases in value when people think civilization is going to collapse, and if that is happening, you have a bigger problem than your money working for you. You might as well tell people to invest in bullets and gasoline.<TheSecretMe>: That's why sane people use gold as a value store during economic downturn. The goal there isn't return on investment but reducing losses.<insidezone64>: But it is worthless as a value store, essentially. You'd be better off investing in a bond index, at least they go up during an economic depression, because people chase yield.<TheSecretMe>: I don't think you understand how people use gold as a value store.<insidezone64>: I don't think you understand the level of civilization breakdown that would be required to make gold a viable value store.<TheSecretMe>: It wouldn't take a break down of civilization? This isn't a hypothetical. Buying gold is a popular way of storing value during market upheaval.<insidezone64>: So is buying bond funds, which is also more lucrative because *dividends*.", "num_messages": 18, "avg_score": 1009.1666666667}

I figured they were saying that you should pay more if you've created more work for them, if not by leaving stuff moved then by making it harder to clean with the new layout. Your comment made it seem like you think there's a social trend towards tipping too much, and I'm more concerned about people tipping too little. Maybe I misunderstood you. Overall I agree tipping is dumb, but as long as hospitality workers are paid shit, we ought to tip as well as we can afford to.<Energy_Turtle>: I wouldn't say I'm concerned about too much but some things that expect tips are just ridiculous. Why can't I just say thanks? Should I tip a bartender for pouring a beer on tap? Or popping a top? Do I have to tip hotel housekeeping for cleaning my room? What about takeout?

It would take multiple head strikes with significant power in order to kill yourself like that. Part of a correctional officers job is to watch for suicidal individuals and prevent them from killing themselves. They would stop you from accomplishing suicide by banging your head into something, as this is a not infrequent occurence.<colddecembersnow>: I get that, the point was if it would be easier with or without a staple. I'd say the damage caused would be greater than trying to insert a staple far enough to cut an artery (or multiple tries) than the amount of time to bang your head a few times. I get suicide watch, but this is a hypothetical question.<Vanden_Boss>: In a hypothetical you still have to account for external factors like the guards. There has to be recognition that they will do their jobs and stop an attempted suicide. You can hide a staple and attempt to hide the injuries you are attempting to cause. Yes it is difficult to actually do, but it is more possible than beating your head against the wall, pretty much entirely because it is more subtle and can be concealed.", "num_messages": 13, "avg_score": 1095.3076923077}

How do they cover up the line for the film?<viselyx>: CG editing.<paggo_diablo>: One of my many beefs with current stop motion.<basetornado>: In what way? CGI is a great tool when used sensibly.<paggo_diablo>: I just feel like if they're going to throw so much cg (tidying up seams, 3d printing faces from what is pretty much just a CG animation, green screen backgrounds etc) at a stop motion film then they might as well just make a CG animation. The only difference in the mediums is that one makes you say \"Wow, that looked hard to make\".<basetornado>: You can do a lot with stop motion alone. Yes its harder to make and it always will be. But there is a point when you can either spend a lot of time and effort on something totally trivial that could easily be fixed with a small amount of CGI, or you could use that time saved to improve something else in the film. Isle of Dogs had some greenscreen backgrounds, but there was also an absurd amount of background detail that could easily have been CGI, but was instead practical stop motion. Its about creating an even balance.<Jaerin>: I think the point is those lines and flaws are what make stop motion unique and captivating in the first place. Otherwise all you're really doing is an animation with a more realistic composition.<basetornado>: Id argue that flaws are a part of stop motion. But production lines like those shown are what cgi is made for. Leaving them in to avoid using cgi is stubborn stupidity.<Jaerin>: No its a design choice. The point of my comment was that just because you can cover up those flaws doesn't mean you should for design reasons.<basetornado>: Those flaws are built in to facilitate production. You could build without it, but it would make stop motion even less viable.<Jaerin>: Again you're missing the whole point. Yes those flaws are to facilitate stop motion. If you want something to look stop motion then you'd expect it to have the flaws of stop motion. Not having the flaws makes it look like someone pretending to do stop motion.<basetornado>: Whats your point? That stop motion should have production seams left in? You can produce it without those production seam. Its just going to take more time and cost. Stop motion already is a risky proposition.

But school buses aren't doing hundreds of miles in a day, so I'd imagine they cope just fine, and charge at the end of the day (or even mid-day).<Shakeyshades>: My favorite part is \"...repairs to diesels are more complicated and costly.\"<iamzombus>: Well, electric motors really only have one moving part.<Shakeyshades>: True but determining why that particular part doesn't work can be a hell of a lot more difficult<iamzombus>: Yeah, but if it's modular they can be swapped out and then refurbished. Just from my basic understanding you only need a few components to make a motor run. A Motor, power source, drive, and a drive controller. There's probably more complex systems involved in a car, like charging systems, etc... but just a rudimentary system.<Shakeyshades>: Determining which system isn't working properly is the problem. It's not a diy situation. A random city diesel mechanic is not likely to be an expert on electronics. Or be able to determine which driver is bad and why it went bad. There's actually a lot to these things even if it's a rudimentary system.<quibbelz>: Mechanics would have to be trained, just like any new tech in a car.<Shakeyshades>: Which means that's it's not as easy as the article claims. Which is my point.<quibbelz>: TBF pulling an electric motor and swapping it is much easier than swapping a big diesel. Its not that hard disconnect the battery pull some bolts and take it out. Sounds a lot like changing a tranny to me. Like I said any new tech will require training. My friend is a BMW mech, the amount of training he does is silly.<Shakeyshades>: The problem isn't removing and replacing a motor which May or may not be easier than removing an engine. is determining whether it's the motor or drives or any of the other electrical problems that drive the system. not the actual physical labor of removing and replacing a part it's the knowledge of how to and the understanding of why. I'm a generator mechanic and I do both electricity and diesels and I work on car with the knowledge from professional training<quibbelz>: That all makes sense but I also know that it would be trivial to put sensors to do most of the troubleshooting. The three systems (battery, control and drive) could easily be made modular. If you know its the motor you swap it and fix the bad one on the bench. That reduces downtime. Theres a lot more to disconnect on a ICE engine to remove vs an electric motor, you have to admit that?<Shakeyshades>: All these things are technical that you're bringing up. Which is where the issue lies, making easier to diagnose is one thing that's entirely more complicated. [Here's](https://youtu.be/ulfONX9lPUQ) a video of a guy removing the front motor from a looks like wrecked Tesla. Give me your judgement on easy removal and installation<quibbelz>: I thought we were talking about busses?<Shakeyshades>: We are but it still applies in a way that it's an EV and will have larger motor and power sources due to the weight.<quibbelz>: Since you brought up [Tesla](https://www.quora.com/How-big-is-the-Tesla-Motor-compared-to-an-IC-engine-and-where-do-they-put-it), their motors are much smaller than an ICE engine. What makes you think they are larger than ICE? Also the electric motor on a bus would be where the diff was. Much easier to access than an ICE.<Shakeyshades>: Wtf? I didn't say that.... I said a motor for a bus would be larger than a Tesla motor. Also bus engines are pretty easy to get to. Point is you still have a lot of work it's not just remove a connector and some bolts and nuts.<quibbelz>: Comparing a bus engine and a tesla engine has no relevance to this discussion. I dont know why you even brought it up. What else is there to changing a motor on an EV bus then? You dont seriously think putting senors on the equipment is something they dont already do? The batteries sure as hell already have them. Have you ever worked on an EV bus? If not then you have no idea and are talking out your ass. Get over yourself.<Shakeyshades>: Apparently you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

And why on earth would his eyes get sucked out of his head if the goggles didn't have water in them?<jfffj>: [Mask squeeze](https://www.emedicinehealth.com/wilderness_face_squeeze/article_em.htm) As you dive deeper the pressure increases and the air in the mask tries to occupy less space. This pulls the mask onto your face, painfully. In extreme cases this can cause injury. Divers mitigate this by deliberately blowing air out of their noses into the mask.<Morall_tach>: Then if anything they'd be pushed into his head. It's pressure, not suction.<jfffj>: The air volume reduces. This pulls everything around into the air space. Think about it. Or just trust me, or somebody you know to be a diver. They'll all tell you the same.<Morall_tach>: The air volume reduces because the pressure outside the mask is pushing in. The same quantity of air is now in a smaller space, which *increases* pressure. The article you linked even says \"The air in the mask has more pressure put on it, and therefore becomes painful against the face.\"<jfffj>: Which is fine, until the mask cannot compress any more, at which point surrounding tissues try to fill the available space. This isn't a difficult concept. Seriously, go ask another diver, you clearly don't believe this one.<Morall_tach>: I don't need to ask a diver, this is basic physics. If the gas inside a chamber increases in pressure, it presses *outward* in every direction, including on the diver's face. It can't magically turn to suction, pulling *in* on the diver's face, unless the pressure in the mask is less than the pressure outside, which can only happen if there's suddenly less air inside the mask (which there isn't) or the chamber gets bigger (which it doesn't). The tissues don't try to fill the available space because there isn't space available. The air is trying to get out of the mask by pushing equally in every direction, including on the face.<jfffj>: This will be my last response. There's only so much dumb I can deal with. &gt;unless the pressure in the mask is less than the pressure outside Lol. You got there in the end. The chamber (inside the mask) is sealed. The pressure *outside* increases, not the inside. The pressure inside is now lower than the outside. &gt;which can only happen if there's suddenly less air inside the mask (which there isn't) or the chamber gets bigger (which it doesn't) Sigh... Doesn't have to be less air inside the chamber, only the same air at a lower pressure inside a flexible container. See [this](https://youtu.be/cHf9eWRd_bc?t=36)? That's a sealed flexible container being taken to a higher pressure, See what happens? It gets smaller (and miraculously no air was lost from the container!).

Medium Baconator Combo is pushing towards $12 after tax at Wendy's I can spend like $4 on three grillers and $1 on a drink at TB.<LilFingies45>: \"Food is a third the price but quality is better!\" Umm... <calotron>: The quality of TB has gotten better while their prices have remained very affordable vs some of the competition having worse value per dollar based on what you're getting. Not sure what's confusing.<LilFingies45>: Because of how implausible their food being so much cheaper and yet somehow higher quality while remaining competitive. Frankly the quality may have improved in relation to competitors, but you are comparing some of the lowest quality food chains around.<Pvt_Lee_Fapping>: However implausible it may be that Taco Bell food is higher quality than Wendy's while still being cheaper, it's not impossible for that to be the case, and this person was just remarking how awesome that is. Plus, you can still compare food quality of these places even if they're on the lower end of quality overall. Not everything has to be from Chipotle or Panera, dude; ease up. <LilFingies45>: &gt; Taco Bell food is higher quality than Wendy's while still being cheaper, Such an insanely low bar. I'm not harshing on anyone. I can't afford fast food right now, so I taught myself how to cook a few items and every now and then I try to learn something new. I eat super healthy for cheaper than fast food. Who the fuck said anything about Chipotle or Panera? If you want to eat cheap and healthy, cook. That's your only option. The fast food chains being mentioned in here peddle toxic trash that tastes like shit soon after you stop eating it. Same goes for soda in general. It'll keep you alive, but it'll also slowly kill you if you consume enough of it. And don't get mad at me because I'm putting things into perspective. <Pvt_Lee_Fapping>: &gt; Such an insanely low bar. I'm not harshing on anyone. Lemme stop ya right there. You might not *want to*, but you are. This is the same thing as saying \"no offense, but you suck\" to somebody's face. That's the only reason anyone is getting pissy with you here: it's not the \"harsh reality that we're slowly killing ourselves\" (bitch please! *Just breathing will slowly kill you.* What do you expect? To live forever? Just enjoy what you've got.), it's that the way you said things make you sound pretentious, hence the jab about Panera. And since you don't realize that bit, and you think we're mad about something else instead of mad at you for something you said, I'm inclined to think that's true. Peace. <LilFingies45>: Don't make specious claims about Taco Bell being the \"healthiest fast food chain\", which is simply untrue and when pressed no source was provided. Then the claim had to be qualified in comparison to the 3 or 4 worst quality restaurants in business. Pretty stupid claim at this point, but still no source. &gt; This is the same thing as saying \"no offense, but you suck\" to somebody's face. I never said anything like that. I occasionally drink alcohol, which is worse than fast food, but I don't go around claiming that it's relatively healthy. Ever. Because it's not and that would just be wishful thinking. Look you just want to be able to tell yourself happy things that aren't necessarily true and you expect the rest of us to smile and agree with your delusion. That's a hard pass. You're harshing my own sense of reality. I like how you skipped over everything I said and instead of addressing any of it you launched another rant. If you want to eat your garbage food, then eat it.

There's not really any need for citations in this informal forum; I took it to mean that it was his/her opinion and any evidence is anecdotal. &gt; you just want to be able to tell yourself happy things that aren't necessarily true and you expect the rest of us to smile and agree with your delusion.

LMAO.<Alex01854>: Yes, because uniformity is far more important than virtue signaling. I wouldn\u2019t allow my officers to have long hair, beards, dreads, etc for the same reason. Many cop killers have made it know that they chose to kill a particular officer because he/she didn\u2019t look capable and they didn\u2019t take them seriously.<Jake1999x>: They\u2019re not virtue signalling, they\u2019re supporting a community they WORK FOR. Loads of cops here (UK) have beards and stuff, I\u2019ve even been up in front of a police inspector who had a beard. The beard didn\u2019t make me take him less seriously.<Alex01854>: Perhaps you didn\u2019t, but the FBI conducted a survey with convicted cop killers and the general consensus was that they attacked the officer because they knew they could win. The first thing that they noticed was the officer\u2019s appearance, which was sloppy and poorly maintained. There\u2019s a huge difference between the LAPD and the NYPD in terms of appearance.<Jake1999x>: Oh, right. Yeah, I suppose if a policeman looks like they\u2019ve just got out of bed then it might make a difference. The beard thing might just be a British thing cause I\u2019ve even seen prison officers with beards, but I\u2019m guessing there were rules cause they always had their beards neatly trimmed. So are American cops not allowed beards *at all* then?", "num_messages": 13, "avg_score": 2.9230769231}
