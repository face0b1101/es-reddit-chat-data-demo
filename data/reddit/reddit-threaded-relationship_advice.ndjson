Update after this: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6bvfm/_/ Thanks to everyone who gave advice last time. It was really helpful and it made me feel better. The internet is a weird place, never would've thought I would end up asking advice from strangers. At first I wanted to talk with her over lunch, but I realized that it could possibly get pretty emotional and I didn't want to be in a public place with other people, so I invited her to my house. She came over and was clearly still upset. She had puffy eyes and it looked like she had been crying all night, I felt pretty bad. I started off by saying that I wasn't going to break up with her because she seemed afraid I would, and this cheered her up a little bit. After that I straight up asked her what lead her to set me up. She didn't immediately want to tell me but I made it clear I needed to know her reasons, so eventually she gave in. She said that the past few weeks I've been emotionally and physically distant, and that my behavior lined up with her ex boyfriends when they started cheating on her. I had to hold her when she said this because she had a lot of trouble telling me. I completely blame myself in this scenario, and I feel horrible for making her feel this way. 3 weeks before this happened I started taking antidepressants and it's been pretty rough on me. My mistake was never telling my girlfriend I started taking them. I will admit that I'm a bit ashamed for turning to meds to try and fix my problems. I was afraid what my girlfriend might think of me and why I would need them. The side effects aren't treating me too well and my libido went down like crazy, what she says is unfortunately kind of true. I totally understand how my girlfriend thought something was up. I haven't been myself and I feel horrible for keeping this from her. We had a wonderful conversation about communication afterwards and she fully supports me and is extremely understanding. We still talked about what happened and I told her I wouldn't put up with it again, and she agreed and kept saying sorry. I can tell that she really knows this was not OK. But what I did was also not OK, and we won't be hiding our feelings from each other anymore. Things have improved since then, we've seen each other a few more times and it's starting to feel like how it used to be again. But it will take some more time for sure. Oh and I met the friend once more with my girlfriend and she gave me really weird vibes. She was extremely touchy and flirty with me to the point where even my girlfriend got annoyed. We probably won't be seeing her again, I don't see how she thinks that was a cool move. **Edit: No, I wasn't sexually assaulted and I'm not being gaslit. That's straight up ridiculous. That's blowing things way out of proportion. I'm NOT a victim.** **I don't know why I have to say this again. I wasn't assaulted and I don't feel violated. She sat on my lap for 15 seconds and we kissed for maybe 5 because I froze. After I realized what was going on I pushed her off me. I don't need PM's telling me to break up.** <English_Guy_>: Glad to have some good news here thanks for the update.<NavyScott>: This is not good news. This guy was conned it in to staying with a woman who had him sexually assaulted because of her immature insecurities and now he somehow believes it was his fault. <TheVillianousFondler>: People become damaged and make shitty decisions that can hurt like hell and sometimes it's not right to forgive them but sometimes it is. All you know about this girl is possibly one of the biggest mistakes in her life but she's a lot more than that. She did a shitty thing that maybe I wouldn't even be able to forgive, it's hard to know, but I'm sure if someone made a post about one of your shitty lapses in judgement in life, the internet mafia would be instantly condemning you just as you are this girl, not knowing of your life's achievements, the good you've done or the hurt you've felt that led you to that point. Maybe you're absolutely right and op is making the wrong decision, but he would know better than either of us whether she's worth it, whether she can learn and grow, whether this was just a moment of shit judgement or a pattern that needs to be ended<NavyScott>: Having your boyfriend sexually assaulted is not just a mistake. She honestly deserves jail time and so does the friend. There is no excuse for what she did or her manipulation after the fact. Edit- it's hilarious that one of your last comments was saying it's unacceptable for a guy to get a lapdance at a stripclub but I guess it's okay for someone to have ther SO sexually assaulted. <persceptivepanda26>: Oh ffs he wasn't sexually assaulted. You can't go to the police and go \"This girl jumped on my lap and was pushy with me until I told her to stop, which she then complied\" whether you're male or female.<NavyScott>: She in nothing but her underwear hopped on his lap and forced him to kiss her against his will. That is 100% sexual assault. Yes you can clearly go to the police for this level of sexual assault. What is wrong with you? <persceptivepanda26>: Not forced...just regular kissed. I assume you've never gone to any of your partners \"Do you consent to me kissing you?\". Also when he asked her to stop...she stopped. This kinda misuse of \"sexual assault\" is what is fucking the metoo movement and it's honestly obnoxious.<NavyScott>: Yes absolutely forced. Did you even bother to read the original OP? She wasn't his partner so I have no idea why you bring that up. In fact she knew without a doubt that he had another partner and already turned down her advances. This is 100% sexual assault. <persceptivepanda26>: Partner doesn't mean dating just the person you're *with* when kissing. What would she be charged with?<NavyScott>: With sexual assault like I believe I have made very clear. She was clearly not his partner in any way. <persceptivepanda26>: She was his kissing *partner*. Do you struggle in the English language dear lord? Again nothing was forced, she didn't hold him down and kiss him, and the courts would shoo this nonsense in a second <NavyScott>: Are you stupid? The friend \"L\" kissed her friends\"OPs girlfriend\" boyfriend\"OP'. Absolutely nothing can be construed there to think L was in anyways OPs partner. It was absolutely forced and after he already turned down her advances. She got on his lap and kissed him, how much more do you need him to be \"held down\" for it to count as assault? You are disgusting. <persceptivepanda26>: part\u00b7ner1 /\u02c8p\u00e4rtn\u0259r/ \ufffcLearn to pronounce noun 1. either of a pair of people engaged together in the same activity. The has to be lips to kiss, for there to be kissing, he may not of being giving, but he was receiving therefore he is a partner.

You are disgusting. Either holding him down, or not stopping the *kissing* when he told her to. &gt;You are disgusting. You're reaching and diminishing what it means to be sexually assaulted,that's pretty fuckin disgusting in my book.<NavyScott>: Yep complete idiot. If I go kiss a random person on the bus that doesn't make them my \"partner\" in any way. This is literally the definition of sexual assault. You trying to justify it is disgusting. <persceptivepanda26>: There's no context there, there's context here. If this is assault then literally nobody can kiss on just a feeling and have to go \"JUST SO YOU KNOW, IM ASKING YOU FOR KISSING CONSENT. I REPEAT, KISSING CONSENT. I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO JAIL FOR KISSING YOU WITHOUT THIS WARNING!\" Anyways &gt;Yep complete idiot. If I go kiss a random person on the bus that doesn't make them my \"partner\" Actually it would lol, but I can see were struggling with the English language. &gt;You trying to justify it is disgusting. Lm-ao<NavyScott>: Yeah there is context here and it makes it worse. He turned down her advances, she knows he is in a committed relationship, and the whole thing was a setup. Yes you literally can not go up to random people and start kissing on them. Seriously don't go out in the world if you don't agree. <persceptivepanda26>: &gt;Yeah there is context here and it makes it worse. He turned down her advances, she knows he is in a committed relationship, and the whole thing was a setup. Yes but to him, it was not. The whole thing was contingent on her actually being a mistress, it suddenly wouldn't stop being \"assault\" if he went along with it. My point being, this was just a normal hook up in their eyes, they weren't set on *making* him kiss her, hence giving up when he told her to stop kissing. &gt;Yes you literally can not go up to random people and start kissing on them. Seriously don't go out in the world if you don't agree. It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself at this point.<WitchettyCunt>: &gt; it suddenly wouldn't stop being \"assault\" if he went along with it Why wouldn't it? &amp;#x200B;<persceptivepanda26>: If somebody comes up behind you and starts raping you without your consent, but you give in eventually because you like it, it would still be rape, you just got lucky and enjoyed it. My point being, the moment something becomes assault, you can't un-assault it. However, with her kissing him, if we can say kissing back would've been infidelity, then we can say it wasn't assault to begin with.<WitchettyCunt>: Those are barely coherent sentences. &amp;#x200B; &gt; raping you without your consent As opposed to raping me with consent? &amp;#x200B; &gt; However, with her kissing him, if we can say kissing back would've been infidelity, then we can say it wasn't assault to begin with. That's a non sequitur, though it's hard to tell through the forest of commas. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;<persceptivepanda26>: &gt;As opposed to raping me with consent? CNC, yes it's a thing. &gt;That's a non sequitur, though it's hard to tell through the forest of commas. I mean, I just made the previous, argument, which most sane people can agree upon, and the second argument follows that train of thought. There were 3 commas in that sentence, if that's a forest for you don't go to college for any kind of higher degree.<WitchettyCunt>: So you're just going to ignore that the first C in CNC stands for consensual? Roleplay isn't rape, do you disagree? &amp;#x200B; I've already graduated :( Does it make you feel like a big man to be condescending? You are aware that using more commas than necessary makes it reads clumsily and with an awkward cadence? &amp;#x200B; &gt;There were 2 commas in that sentence This sentence? &gt;However, with her kissing him, if we can say kissing back would've been infidelity, then we can say it wasn't assault to begin with. Are you sure you don't want to change your answer to 3?<persceptivepanda26>: &gt;Roleplay isn't rape, do you disagree? Not at all, as would most of r/rapekink &gt;I've already graduated :( Does it make you feel like a big man to be condescending? What degree? And I could say the same for you seeing as how three commas suddenly becomes so much of a forest to you it's worth pointing out lol. &gt;You are aware that using more commas than necessary makes it reads clumsily and with an awkward cadence? That read like a wine enthusiast talking about a oaky flavour, and caressing aroma. &gt;Are you sure you don't want to change your answer to 3? I realized that within seconds of commenting, hence why it doesn't even say edit. At this point you're so lost in being pedantic and argumentative it's sad.<WitchettyCunt>: But you just said that you could consensually rape someone. So are you wrong in this comment or wrong in the previous comment? Biomedical science with an honours in cancer research you dickhead, did you really just try and gatekeep university degrees? Pathetic and insecure. Yes it does make me feel like a big man, at least i'm not coy about it. You know the words awkward and cadence aren't exactly pretentious or exotic right?<persceptivepanda26>: I said I don't agree *at all*, although I can see the confusion, because you asked if I *disagree*, silly me. &gt;Biomedical science with an honours in cancer research you dickhead, did you really just try and gatekeep university degrees? Pathetic and insecure. Sorry, being pedantic on the internet about commas, and avoiding the original point habitually doesn't scream that, you can be one thing and present another, clearly. &gt;Pathetic and insecure. Projection. Which you seem fond of as with this... (see below in case you get lost, I wouldn't want to confuse you out of the original point again). &gt;Yes it does make me feel like a big man, at least i'm not coy about it. &gt;You think the words awkward and cadence aren't exactly pretentious or exotic right? In this context it's pretty pretentious. Seeing as how you went from 'I barely understand what you're saying.' to 'I know what you're saying, but your sentence structure (because of 3 commas, one being a mandatory transition word) reads clumsly' ,that leads me to believe it was just some bitchy point. You might just be someone who struggles with this style of long, drawn out, non-choppy, writing. It takes time to get used to, my fiance writes like this because he has a hard on for stream of consciousness writing, which will give any normal person a stroke reading, and I also struggled to follow along as first, but now I guess I too have been sucked into the comma cult, oh dear. Oh, and yes, I intentionally made that last diatribe as comma ridden and stroke inducing as possible I hope you enjoyed.<WitchettyCunt>: Of course it was just a bitchy point, but you wasted a lot of energy :) I noticed that you aren't volunteering your field of study, why not? You weren't expecting me to have a degree that you couldn't hand have away? What was the point of asking unless you were hoping i was. gender studies major? <persceptivepanda26>: &gt;What was the point of asking unless you were hoping i was. gender studies major? What was that saying about seeing a speck in someone else's eye, and missing a plank in your own lol? ATM I'm trying to major in cognitive psychology. I'm done with, whatever this was. It was fun talking to someone who has a degree in \"Biochemistry and honors in cancer research\", that doesn't know the 'I 'in I'm is capitalized, I itself is capitalized when referring to yourself, or any of the other many laughable offenses I ignored up until now because it seemed menial. Goodbye.<WitchettyCunt>: You can't even admit that you were hoping to make fun of me if I didn't do a STEM degree? You haven't even graduated... Lol.", "num_messages": 29, "avg_score": 26.0}

Please help. 24M here. To begin, I was always rejected and bullied as a kid - just because i was a little bit overweight and couldn't do sports as other kids. As a conclusion, I grew up very shy and with barely any friends. So, my best friend was the computer (video games ftw). I was so shy to the point where I could barely form a verbal sentence when talking to someone outside of my small group of friends and family. And eye contact was the worst. And my classmates always exploited my shyness to make fun of me and to make me feel horribly - tbh i hated school for this reason. In high school, I had my first rejection in love. I used to like a girl, but since only the nerdiest nerds (not meaning to insult, they were good friends after all) were my friends, I didn't have anyone to ask for advice. I don't wanna get into details about how it happened but it was weird and she instantly blocked me, even though I didnt say anything rude or weird). To be honest she was quite a spoiled rich girl. The same happened in Uni, when i asked a girl out. I had (and still have) a crush on her for a long time. Having the bad experience from high school, I stuttered and failed miserably because i was too honest. We've talked a little since then. And, since that happened, I tried and tried and tried to meet new girls. But something about me is freaking them out. And I don't know what. I get rejected even on tinder - by the extremely few matches i ever get. Don't get me wrong, I'm neither creepy, nor ugly, nor messy. Actually, I personally consider i'm decent looking. And I have a nice personality (pretty much the \"mysterious intelectual\" type). I think it just happens for me to have almost no interaction skills. I can't take it any longer. I have developed an addiction to alcohol because of this. I am an unhappy person and my only respite is the alcohol. I barely have any sleep at night and I barely eat. I hate my life so much. The worst thing is that nobody ever told me what i am doing wrong and how to fix that, instead they dump me like garbage. And that they dont give me a single chance to prove myself. Now I can't even make eye contact with any girl, let alone start a conversation with her. Or behave naturally around her. I dont even try approaching new people in fear of being rejected. What should i do about that? How/where/under what circumstances should I meet girls? If you're willing to, explain like you would explain to somebody learning basic human interaction behavior. I really want to get a chance with someone (a decent being - i'm not that desperate and I'm not gonna lower my standards forever). Thank you for patience and sorry if my post makes no sense or has bad grammar . I don't mind going to therapists. I tried it and it didnt help me at all.<xRedddx>: I think you need to grow (on your own), and learn social skills - in particular with women (as in friendships, even approaching bars for chats). Along with this, improve on yourself in whatever way you can think of - get some hobbies like going to the gym, woodwork etc. This can help with having something to talk about, as well as learning skills on your own, which can make a person who is already interesting a lot more so.<throwawayAcc123asd>: And how can i learn social skills without embarassing myself first?<kitsch_kath>: I\u2019m not sure that you have a realistic idea of what socialising is for other people ... do you not think that every other person has been embarrassed? Everyone has misunderstood a social clue, everyone has had bad timing, when delivering a joke, everyone has had words come out differently than they planned to. You really, truly seem completely normal - but hyper aware about yourself, and that might be what\u2019s ruining your social interactions. Perhaps work on thinking less about yourself, when speaking with someone, and more about the topic of discussion? And as a 24 year old woman I can give you some hints on how I look at men. Just have in mind that I am only one woman, and I can only speak for myself. This is going to be some hard truths, so just take a second to figure out if you actually want the information, or if you would rather live without. 1) You say that you\u2019re good looking. First of all: have you had that confirmed by someone who isn\u2019t you or your mother? Also keep in mind that handsomeness isn\u2019t really a measurable thing. My, very personal, type is someone about my own height, kind eyes, those wrinkles around your mouth, that you get from smiling a lot, reddish hair, a beard, pale skin and freckles, a \u201cdad-bod\u201d (soft belly, thick thighs and not too defined muscles), strong hands, wide back, etc. I also really like men with glasses \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f So, as you can see, attractiveness isn\u2019t always muscles and tattoos. It isn\u2019t even necessarily a full head of hair ... 2) You describe yourself as \u201cintellectual\u201d. To me that is an instant turn-off. I\u2019m not saying that I want a complete idiot, by any means! But the moment someone describes themselves as intellectuals I just have an inkling that s/he is going to be an irritating know-it-all, and then I\u2019ll (subconsciously) work on proving that inkling. I don\u2019t want to be in an infinite competition with my SO, so I generally don\u2019t go for \u201cthe intellectuals\u201d. 3) The biggest turn-off is the pity-party. No, I don\u2019t have to feel bad for you. No, women don\u2019t owe you anything, and no, I don\u2019t feel like picking you up, when you don\u2019t even seem to work for it yourself! I have no problem dating people, who is having a rough time. I have anxiety and depression myself, so I get it. I wouldn\u2019t even mind being with an addict - as long as I see a will to improve! But giving up on dating and socialising because \u201cwomen won\u2019t even tell me what to do!\u201d isn\u2019t something I\u2019m jumping to get involved in \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f as a kid I ran around with a little notebook and studied my peers, to figure out how to \u201cbe normal\u201d. I didn\u2019t expect others to teach me. You are your own responsibility, and your own problem. No one is going to \u201cfix\u201d you, but you. Get up, get out, talk to people, embarrass yourself, learn a lot and stop taking yourself so damn seriously! 4) The drinking. It\u2019s gotta stop, dude. Get some help. Go to AA meetings, get a sponsor, find a supporting subreddit. You deserve better than ruining your life with alcohol. 5) Tinder. As a pretty hard rule I eliminate people, who has no bio, and only has one old photo on their profile. What\u2019s up with that? Do you really think that you\u2019re so good looking that one picture will be enough. Either step up your game with some more photos (silly ones are fine too!) and a candid description of yourself, or get out of it. Right now it seems like you\u2019re only using Tinder to validate your self-pity. Generally; clean yourself up, take yourself less seriously, stop your desperate search for ladies and find a hobby, that gets you up, out and talking to someone - anyone! Go visit people in nursing homes, volunteer at an animal shelter, work at a food bank, go to conventions, sit and read at the local library. Just. Do. Something.<TheFlowersYouGave>: What an amazing, well thought out comment. Also your ideal type is exactly my husband lol so I thought that was funny.<kitsch_kath>: That is actually quite funny! Just the other day I looked back at my previous relationships and it was actually kind of freaky, how much of a type I apparently have \ud83d\ude02<TheFlowersYouGave>: The fact that you have that type already just shows maturity tbh. Most people get so wrapped up in physical wants that they completely ignore amazing people. I got lucky, you will too. Men that you described always seem to be really sweet, even if I am generalizing.", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 62.5714285714}

We went on a couple of dates until I noticed she slowly stopped talking to me. I found out she had gotten back with her boyfriend. We remained friendly since we would run into each other at the gym (that's how we met). A year later, they break up. I decided to go for it again and asked her out. She was pretty upfront about him and I learned that they have been off-and-on for almost four years. She left him because he started to get abusive. We get married a little over a year later. A few months later, she gets pregnant. Last week, I was sitting in the kitchen studying until I heard my wife yell out, crying. I ran over to her to ask her what was wrong. She had difficulty speaking, but, she eventually showed me a post on facebook that a mutual friend between her and her ex had posted. Her ex had gotten into a motorcycle accident and had died. My wife was/is an avid motorcyclist who stopped riding once she got pregnant. She knew how passionate he was about motorcycle riding just as much as her and how tragic it is. I console my wife and help her get to bed, letting her know that I'm here for her. I didn't think much about the whole thing until my wife told me last night that she wants to name our baby after him. I hesitated for a bit and told her that I feel uncomfortable with it. For one, it's her ex. Second, he was abusive. Why would she want to honor someone like that? My wife got pretty upset and just wouldn't hear me out on my reasons. She won't talk to me at all. Am I really in the wrong here? I'm just thinking that my wife is extremely emotional at the moment since she's pregnant and trying to process he ex's death. Any advice? <TLDR>: My wife's abusive ex-boyfriend died and she wants to name our baby after him. I don't. Now, she's mad at me.<FroggyMcnasty>: Okay I'll be the asshole here. Is the kid yours? She's left you for him before, you got married really quickly, and she got pregnant shortly after. It doesn't exactly sound like she was over him given her response and wanting to name the kid after him. On the not asshole side. You are absolutely correct in not wanting to have your child named after her ex, that's an incredibly disturbing thing to have to explain, which shouldn't even be an issue in the first place. I really hope she's just being in a heightened emotional state because that is very disrespectful to you and the marriage.<turbomaxshootem>: Yes, the kid is mine. When we started dating again, her ex moved back home to another state. We moved closer to our families too, right before we got married.<missile>: Get a pregnancy test. There are prenatal pregnancy tests available now. Or you can wait until after the baby is born if you want to do it without her knowing. Because the fact that she wants to name her child after this ex boyfriend is all kinds of suspicious -- why not give him your name + Jr? She clearly still carried a massive torch for him. And there are about a billion holes in this \"ex moved away\" alibi. He can visit, after all.<gjs628>: This, EXACTLY, if he was a motorcyclist there\u2019s nothing stopping them from visiting without OP knowing and I would even say that the chances are very high they had contact without his knowledge. \u201cI left him because he was abusive\u201d sounds very much like \u201che left me because he had 6 other girlfriends and I only married you because I couldn\u2019t marry him\u201d. I don\u2019t think this girl ever had any intention of settling down with OP by choice until she had the choice made for her by her ex. Look how quickly she was willing to dump him the moment her ex came calling again the first time. The sad truth of the matter is that she still holds this guy in high regard and because OP had the audacity to dare to disrespect his memory, that\u2019s why she\u2019s angry about the baby name. Nobody in their right mind would suggest to their husband to name their child after their ex unless they were still madly in love with them and didn\u2019t give a shit what their spouse thought. Let\u2019s put it another way: how would she feel if he had dumped her every time a new Halo game came out and then decided to name their child *Master Chief*?<missile>: Oh, good point about him being a motorcyclist. And the alternative theory for him being called \"abusive\" sounds much more plausible.<FuckMeShitterMatey>: What does the motorcycle have to do with anything? You don\u2019t need a motorcycle to meet up...<walksoftcarrybigdick>: Right? I saw that leap and was suddenly confused.<openup91011>: It\u2019s based off of Reddit\u2019s idea that at any point if anyone isn\u2019t acting perfectly they\u2019re obviously cheating and you should nuke the relationship, get 80 paternity tests, call a lawyer, divorce, then wonder about the consequences for irrational behavior later.<boudicas_shield>: Yeah I can\u2019t believe the number of people who are apparently baffled that a pregnant woman who just suffered an unexpected shock (death of a recent ex) might be behaving a bit irrationally right now. Nope. She\u2019s been cheating, the abuse was a lie, she\u2019s been fucking the guy on the side of the road and knows the baby is his. OP should definitely destroy his marriage by demanding a paternity test and then divorcing her either way. Instead of, you know, realising that she\u2019s hormonal and upset and just TALKING to her about this. Do all of these posters scream \u201cCHEATER!\u201d and serve their spouses with divorce papers at every single bump in the marriage road?<celtic_thistle>: The misogyny in those sorts of comments is so obvious.<boudicas_shield>: It is!!

Am I over reacting? Or I have just let him ghost me? <JustMillenialProblem>: You didn't \"let\" him ghost you. He wanted to have sex and you gave him what he wanted. If you want to prevent GOOD people from ghosting you, don't be casual about sex and start improving your ability to read people and their intentions.<Lexi_Banner>: It was a few weeks. She hardly fell into bed immediately. <JustMillenialProblem>: So? Wait months if you have to so you can properly gauge the person you're interacting with. You're going to get ran through by every degenerate in your city if you think waiting a few weeks for sex is sufficient. A total disaster of sexual moral indoctrination has led women to believe that it's standard to have sex with someone after 3 dates. Not a good idea.<Lexi_Banner>: No one has said it is \"standard\" to have sex after three dates. Some people like to have sex as a part of gauging the person they are seeing. Some people like to wait. Both are a-okay, so long as they are doing the do in a safe and responsible manner, and the partners in question are on board with those choices. Some people will ghost because they weren't getting sex. Some will ghost because they got what they wanted. You can't change or control that. Stop trying to slut shame. It's just gross.<JustMillenialProblem>: Because telling people to exhibit some sort of control implies you're \"slut shaming.\" People can do whatever they want, I am providing my perspective on something I believe people have a warped and demented perception of (sex), treating it as something casual when it in actuality isn't. You don't have to agree with what I believe but I think it's pretty gross if a potential partner tells me they got creampied by 3 dudes in the past month. No thanks. There's no possible way to have responsible sex with someone you aren't ready to have a child with. There's always a risk of a condom breaking, an unwanted pregnancy, one person becoming attached and not the other, numerous physiological and psychological consequences that exist independent of one's intentions. This idea that one is \"slut shaming\" because one thinks people should exhibit proper sexual morality is almost as autistic as the feminist notion that pro-life necessarily entails that you're misogynistic. The truth is that people will always give a fuck about your behaviors, tendencies and beliefs because these things literally define your being.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 3.5}

Dump. NC. Move on.<southtea>: Wow. This is pretty bad. I can't believe people give this kind of advice. This subreddit seems so disconnected from the fact that emotional connection and feelings are involved in relationships. OP has been in a relationship with this person for *three* years. Think about everything you've done in the past three years. The friends you've made, friendships you've continued to developed, time you've spent with family. Imagine all of that just ending with no contact whatsoever, you suddenly have no communication with any of them. You're supposed to what, just move on? Just like that? If you're dating someone for three years, you build connections, close connections. You get closer to them than friends and family. You connect with them, you connect with their immediate friends and family, you open yourself up to them, you in a way adopt their whole lifestyle and mold it in with yours. Situations like this are absolutely shit, but that doesn't mean all of a sudden the feelings you developed over the three years are gone. It's not like he's the devil and should be excommunicated because of this. He's a person OP developed trust and a relationship with over three years. No contact and dropping this guy would just cause more emotional pain for OP. Never knowing why, no closure, no goodbyes, no sorrys. The typical person can't do that to someone they've been with for three years. It's not healthy to do that to yourself, or someone else. That's ridiculous to suggest. OP needs to *talk* to him and figure out what the fuck is going on. Continuing the relationship sounds like a bad idea because OP's bf seems to have changed from what OP knew, but completely dropping him, no contact? Have you ever been in a relationship before? That's not a viable solution. <EDIT>: I hold my opinion. This is by far my most downvoted post, and I'm keeping it up. I hope people read this and realize that it's not okay to drop someone like that. It's not healthy in any form. In a severe case, I'll argue differently. In this case, they need to communicate. This is not okay on her BF's part by any means. No one is arguing that here. But the way you all suggest her to continue is simply unhealthy.<meldavis99>: HE KICKED HER OUT AND LOCKED THE DOOR BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE HAVING SEX. The girl's 19.

Also, it isn't abuse if it's meant to protect herself from getting kicked out again for saying 'no' to sex.<WindowWasher8990>: It's abusive behaviour to think that you are entitled to someone's company and their home. She is an adult, quite capable of looking after herself. If the roles were reversed and the girl kicked out the guy because he didn't want sex, you would take the girl's side.

You don't disprove a flat earther, you laugh at them<PresumptuousLogos>: &gt; You don't disprove a flat earther, you laugh at them If you can't disprove them, all that shows is that you don't really understand the world much more than they do. Disproving a flat-earther is easy enough; mention GPS, differing time zones, and the Heaviside layer allowing you to bounce signals to the other side of the world, and show how the calculations would have been different if the earth had been flat. Also mention tides and lunar eclipses, and how they would be different if the moon orbited around the circumference of a flat earth instead of around a spherical one. These latter facts were used by the Chinese in the 15th century and Christopher Columbus in the 17th century to sail around the world. &amp;#x200B; &gt; To disprove your assertions, you would have to make them worth disproving. So if someone says that **your** assertions are not worth disapproving, how would you prove otherwise? Anyone can say that someone else's assertions are not worth disapproving. Conversely, not everyone can actually prove them wrong. &amp;#x200B; Also, I'm glad that you have seen sense and decided to stop using invective. All it does is reflect poorly on you. With this, you are yet another step closer to appearing polished and mature.<WindowWasher8990>: No, you don't bother disproving flat earthers because to engage with them in any way other than absolute ridicule is to weaponize their stupidity and to let them think that their arguments warrant a response rather than a contemptuous silence. I use the same reasoning for antivaxxers and mommy bloggers. Their pseudoscience doesn't warrant the dignity of a response because scientific reasoning is not the same as whatever stupidity it is they spinning at the moment.

Also, the same sort of principle applies to doctrines you're trying to defend; if you can't say a word to defend your doctrine, perhaps it is not worth defending. &gt;I use the same reasoning for antivaxxers and mommy bloggers. Their pseudoscience doesn't warrant the dignity of a response because scientific reasoning is not the same as whatever stupidity it is they spinning at the moment. Their pseudoscience warrants a measured and fact-based reply because their children could die or be disfigured for life by supposedly-rare diseases like measles.

He has a right to feel however he wants to feel, and he has a right to eject whomsoever he wants to from his apartment, but then it would be wrong (but not illegal) for him to tell her to get out in the middle of the night, and without offering a lift for her as well. Since he's entitled to his feelings and the privacy of his apartment, she's entitled to **her** feelings and her right to not be in a relationship too. It's a **two way street**. &gt;worthless and disheartening I'm sorry I can't reply to that, as I'm not sure how 'worthless' is an apt description here, and 'disheartening' is purely subjective, and anyone can say that something feels disheartening, while others might find it 'meh' or even 'nice'.", "num_messages": 14, "avg_score": 124.7142857143}

I don\u2019t even know where to start, I am so devastated. We\u2019ve been in a relationship for 4.5 years, at one of our early dates where we talked about what we want in life, I told him about how I want to get married and have kids one day. He said that he did too, we were on the same page about this and everything else. Somewhere around 1.5-2 years ago he out of the blue told me that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in marriage\u201d and tried to get me to change my opinion. I\u2019ve stayed consistent throughout and we had several tough conversations about how if he doesn\u2019t want to ever get married then I need to go date other people. Ultimately I stayed because he genuinely expressed his love for me and said that he would marry me because it\u2019s important to me. He didn\u2019t want to lose me or our relationship and consistently has told me that it\u2019s beyond anything that he\u2019s ever had and never thought he would ever have. Even today he still says I\u2019m the only person he\u2019s ever wanted to marry and he still does. This past September I went away on a trip for 2 weeks, and in October he proposed to me out of the blue. I was completely blown away and shocked because I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever fully resolved the conversation in marriage. I did *not* provoke/ nag/ ultimatum him into proposing- he came to his own conclusion about wanting to marry me. I had literally no idea that it was going to happen and he planned out the proposal to include both of our friends. The story of the ring blew me away even more: he spent months designing my ring, making sure that it matched my jewelry aesthetic and was just right. He had the jeweler re-do it a few times to get it perfect. He involved his family and artsy friends in the process, created a digital mock up of the ring, created the band from his grandmothers\u2019 wedding bands. It\u2019s truly a unique and special ring. The level of care and detail and effort touched me deeply, I was so stunned and felt so special that he did all this out of his love for me. Immediately people started asking us when the wedding is and with the holidays coming up and us preparing to move into together, it was overwhelming so we agreed to put off planning the wedding until January. It gave us time to enjoy being engaged and enjoy each other without the pressure of wedding planning. My fianc\u00e9 and I were so in love and happy and in sync during all this. In January I came across a venue that seemed perfect, we checked it out and both agreed we didn\u2019t have to look any further. We discussed it together and decided on October. That is when the (new) problems started. Since then, my fianc\u00e9 has been *extremely* hot and cold with me. There were weeks when we together excitedly picked out caterers and djs and wrote up the guest list, followed by him being angry at me and very critical. When I tried to understand why he attributed it to wedding planning, it was overwhelming us both and we were doing ourselves no favors by trying to plan a wedding in under a year. It also surfaced that he was genuinely hurt that I had not moved into his house yet. I have been \u201cmoving in\u201d for over a year now... I spend at least 4 nights there per week but still have my own apt 15 min away from his house. My move stalled primarily because he loves his house - a fixer upper that has been more fixer than upper for the majority of time that I\u2019ve known him. Even though I don\u2019t love the neighborhood, I rent my apartment and agreed to move in if he\u2019d add closets, an oven (yes, there was no oven!!!), a dishwasher, washer/dryer, and get rid of his creepy roommate. He fought me on this stuff for a long time and was incredibly inflexible (I think his guy friends agreeing with me opened his eyes). I wasn\u2019t going to compromise on my home needs since my fianc\u00e9 is well off and had chosen to live like a college kid in a frat house. Standing my ground worked and the house is now in a place where I can comfortably move in. I know my lack of moving hurt him and he felt stupid for telling people I was about to move in and then it never happened and he had to field questions why- he also did this to himself a bit by jumping the gun in telling people. I have apologized profusely for hurting him- until recently i didn\u2019t understand how deeply it affected him. He now understands and acknowledges the role he played in my not moving and has apologized. Fast forward to last Friday: I\u2019d been put on a new grueling work project that had me working over 60 hrs/wk, my fianc\u00e9 had been hot/cold to me for months now, and after a very long week he tells me that he wants to postpone the wedding. I go ballistic because this means canceling the wedding since we had several non-refundable deposits totaling over $10K, we had told all our friends and family to save the date, the wedding is 90% planned, and my dad has been planning an elaborate party for us this summer. The thought of telling everyone is humiliating and the huge amount of money that will be lost. I told my fianc\u00e9 that he\u2019s paying for all the money we won\u2019t get back (we\u2019d been splitting costs 50/50), he cut me a check for over $10K the total on the spot and didn\u2019t care about any of my feelings about canceling. His reason for wanting to postpone is that he wanted us to live together longer than an October wedding would allow, while I get this it completely disregards the fact that I was trying to move in earlier in the year but his behavior had me put the brakes on it. I seriously didn\u2019t expect this problem to last so long- we\u2019ve had lows in our relationship that have been bumps in the road, not the new reality. In my anger and hurt (I\u2019ve been doing a lot for our relationship lately, trying to cheer him up and put my emotions aside) I told him that he either marries me in October or were done: I didn\u2019t want to \u201cpostpone\u201d to some hypothetical date that would never happen and then be strung along for another few years. He ensured me that wouldn\u2019t be the case, but then tonight said well actually I may be right about that. He then said he felt backed into a corner and just says anything to get out of it. He then started telling me about this pattern of brokenness that his followed him around his whole life (which I knew about before and we had discussed many times): his hot/cold behavior (which he now claims he\u2019s been our entire relationship, I just didn\u2019t see it), his greedy selfishness, how he never wants to get married, his history of sabotaging relationships, etc. I asked him flat out if he wants to break up with me and he said no, repeatedly, he just couldn\u2019t stop hurting me and it created this cycle of hurting me, feeling ashamed and sad, and to end the cycle he\u2019s gone to yet another extreme. He said he\u2019s never wanted to marry anyone ever aside from me, but he also is scared of his hot/cold and stringing me along. Has anyone else been in a similar situation and what did you do? I can\u2019t sleep, can\u2019t eat, I\u2019m beyond hurt but I don\u2019t want to be with anyone else. I\u2019ve mentioned all the bad here but there\u2019s been a ton of good, more so, in our relationship. I\u2019m so upset. TL;DR- fianc\u00e9 proposed unsolicited then postponed and maybe changed mind on getting married. <nataxradiator>: so, he wants to try living together to make sure you are right for each other before committing to a lifetime together... seems reasonable. Your response is to deliver an ultimatum that he marry you without that reassurance, in spite of his misgivings. It sounds like you are more interested in having a fancy wedding than you are in having a healthy loving relationship for the rest of your life. Unless you are crazy rich, having 10k in deposits alone for a wedding is really freaking nuts. Just that 10k alone would be almost a down payment on a home for most couples, and you are sinking that and more into a one day party? That alone should give him plenty of reasons to doubt having a relationship. <PrancingPony88>: Not everyone views money the way you do. We live in a large US city where things are expensive - having a full wedding in the city for under $30K is almost impossible. I was just as shocked when I started looking around. And for me $10K *is* a lot of money to throw around so, losing that in deposits is painful. The above is all in addition to the intense pain of hearing those words come out of your SO\u2019s mouth. That is the focal point of my hurt and the money lost/ embarrassment is in addition. <nataxradiator>: is it possible that seeing so much money going toward a one-day event he isn't that into is part of the problem for him as well? I'm not opposed to marriage, but if in planning the wedding I watched my bride-to-be committing to losing in one day more than enough to get a giant head start in life or get ahead greatly, I'd feel pretty rough about it. Maybe he doesn't, but just a thought. If he was on the fence maybe that would push him in the opposite direction.<PrancingPony88>: It\u2019s a good thought, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not a factor here. We have very different views on money where I had to work for every $ I have and he\u2019s been given a bunch. Both of our families also essentially said they want to pay for the wedding (which sounds contradictory on my end given my previous sentence, but i have one of those show-offy parents who will only pay for things that are a reflection of him) so we probably wouldn\u2019t end up paying that much out of pocket either. Neither of us is actually into weddings and we took a lot of time to think about what we want and what feels right for us. When we found the venue that hit the spot, it was exciting and we started planning hand in hand. We had no idea how insane the wedding industry is and we were not prepared for it. We had some very good conversations about everything this morning and are going to start counseling this week to work through our individual fears and see if we can improve our communication. Today was also the first day that we could spend time with each other without the anxiety/doom of the wedding hanging over us: we could actually connect again. So hopefully dating each other and therapy will help. <nataxradiator>: Well that sounds good! Good luck!", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 7.5}

So I (22M) have been dating my gf (22F) for about 2 years. We have a great relationship, communicate very well, get along great, rarely fight, and when we do we talk it out and settle things. We\u2019ll call her Anne. About four or five months ago, Anne started talking about a coworker that she had become friends with. His name is Collin (25M). She works part time at a pizza place with him while she is getting her Master\u2019s. They would occasionally get drinks together at the bar where they work or other places around the city, either the two of them or with other friends. About three months ago, Anne had an Oscars watch party at her place, which I attended along with many of her other friends, including Collin. I was immediately surprised by their interactions; they hugged upon seeing one another, and the part that stuck out to me was he hung out for about 30 minutes after everyone else had left, and helped her clean up the living room. At this point I had gone upstairs because I had some work to do for the next morning. Later that night, I expressed to her that their interactions made me slightly uncomfortable. I said that it appeared that he was clearly attracted to her, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. She assured me that they were just friends, and asked if there was anything she needed to do to prove that to me. I told her no, and that I trusted her, but that I would prefer that they not hang out the two of them. She said that was fine. Fast forward to today, a couple of months later. Anne and I are doing great. We\u2019ve been takin about moving in together in the fall, and she\u2019s very excited by that idea. Earlier this week, she asked me if she would mind if she went to a wine and cheese party at Collin\u2019s house this evening. I said of course not, and asked if she wanted to spend the night at my house afterwards. She asked if I wanted to come, and I told her I couldn\u2019t because I already had plans with some friends to go out tonight. She said she would sleep over. She got home before I did, and when I got home we were snuggling and talking. We were both slightly drunk, not nothing crazy. I asked her how her night was, she said she has a good time, and as she was talking, she said to me, \u201coh my god Collin...\u201d I cut her off, and said, \u201cdid you just call me Collin?\u201d Her face dropped, and she immediately began apologizing, and saying it was a mistake. I said I needed to use the bathroom and excused myself. I sat in my living room thinking for a minute, and after a while she came out of my room, looking visibly upset. I asked her to give me some space, and said that I could call her an uber home, or she could sleep in my room and that I would be sleeping on the couch. She broke down into tears and walked home (only about three blocks). She texted me many times apologizing, saying that she made a mistake and that she will do anything to fix it. I haven\u2019t answered and I don\u2019t know what to say. What should I do here? Am I overreacting for kicking her out? What should I say to her about it? She has never shown any signs of cheating, she loves me very much and I love her. I\u2019m her first serious relationship and she has expressed many times that she wants to be with me for a long time. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but this really upset me. Thanks in advance TL;DR: GF of 2 years called me her \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d name, not sure what to do now. <UPDATE>: 4/21/19 My GF came over after work on Friday so we could talk about it. She was basically in tears when she arrived, and immediately began apologizing, saying that she was so sorry and it was a terrible mistake, and that she understands why it made me so upset. She assured me that they were just friends, and that she sees why their friendship made me uncomfortable. She said she would cut him out of her life and no longer pursue that friendship (that\u2019s most likely what I would have asked of her, but she said it before I even had a chance). I told her I understand, and explained that it made me upset due to the suspicions I already had. I told her I really didn\u2019t want to break up with her and that I wanted to work past it. She agreed, and we\u2019ve been good since. She\u2019s home with me this weekend for Easter! Thanks everyone for the advice, this really is a wonderful community of people!<Muh_Troof>: Probably a mistake on her part, BUT, he is obviously into her and this is a good opportunity to air our all your concerns.<mallegally-blonde>: Is he? My guy friends and I are huggy and some of them will stay after parties/predrinks to help me clean up, but we\u2019re all just good friends. I don\u2019t really see anything particular wrong here.<Muh_Troof>: I guarantee you that 4 out of 5 of those \u201chuggy\u201d friends would bang you in a heartbeat. They are beta orbiters waiting for a chance, they are afraid to take.<mallegally-blonde>: Nope, they\u2019re normal human beings who value women as people.<Muh_Troof>: If you are so sure, why don\u2019t you test them? I\u2019m sure you feel that you\u2019re right, but, eons of biology say different. Then again, the way guys in their teens/early twenties are, nowadays, you may be right. Lol<mallegally-blonde>: Because I\u2019m also a normal person? You\u2019re very strange to think there\u2019s a problem with valuing friendships and not wanting to shag everything that has a pulse, I\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t sustain meaningful relationships.<Muh_Troof>: Lol, uh no, I just know how people think outside of the dream land you live in. I love how in the dark, yet, still know it alls like yourself assume that others, with different opinions, can\u2019t sustain meaningful relationships. In three years, you\u2019ll know the truth.<mallegally-blonde>: You really don\u2019t, your very \u2018American 20th century man is an island\u2019 view isn\u2019t universal, or even timeless.<Muh_Troof>: Lol, ok!", "num_messages": 10, "avg_score": 81.9}

Me and my bf have been together 8 months. I have a 3 year old with another guy that I haven\u2019t been with since my daughter was 1...every time I go to drop my daughter off with her dad or every time he drops her off to me my boyfriend expects me to text him within like 5 minutes to tell him I got her from my ex. I tell him that I don\u2019t always think about doing this because I just want to see my daughter for a bit and hug and kiss on her and show her things I\u2019ve bought her or I\u2019m driving back home or something. He\u2019s insecure about me and my ex because we have hooked up in the past while I was with someone else (way before me and my now bf had started dating) Am I being unreasonable? Also a lot of the time he expects me to text him when I leave and come home. There are never any abusive consequences but he will get frustrated with me and ask me why I didn\u2019t text him. Currently we\u2019re fighting because I told him all of this is just not possible for me so today he has hardly texted me. His way of getting back at me. EDIT.... I have never cheated on my NOW bf. It was an abusive relationship in the past about a month into dating. <luagin>: Hes insecure and immature and apparently doesn't trust you. That's not the most stable relationship<KVirello>: &gt;apparently doesn't trust you Don't pretend he doesn't have good reason to not trust her. She cheated with him in the past. It's not unreasonable to be suspicious of her doing so again. <luagin>: Did I defend her cheating on someone? No. But why would she want to be with someone who doesn't trust her to that level? Also her daughter comes first over his insecurities and giving the silent treatment is incredibly immature. <KVirello>: You're acting like his suspicion is baseless, which is ridiculous. She's a cheater, she's shown herself to be one, and she's undeserving of trust. <luagin>: So I guess she should never be in a relationship again, with your reasoning? Because she has to interact with her ex for the rest of her life. It's one thing to be cautious because of someone's past mistake, it's another thing to demand constant communication because you have zero trust. Being cautious is totally understandable and trust can be built. You can't build trust if you dont have any to begin with. She has tried to keep up with his demands but his demands don't fit the situation. <KVirello>: What I'm saying is she doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt. Her boyfriend is worried about her cheating with her ex *because she did it in the past*. If she didn't cheat with him then she would deserve the benefit of the doubt. But she did. Cheaters are cheaters and once they show their face they don't deserve to be trusted and they don't deserve the benefit of the doubt, which is what you seem to be advocating for. If she doesn't want someone who's worried she might do what she's already shown she's perfectly willing to do, then she should find a boyfriend who's okay with being walked over. <omglol9312>: So I\u2019m not supposed to have a boyfriend now because I\u2019ve cheated on another abusive guy in the past? Lol okay.

Ok, so two weeks ago I came here asking for advice, because not only did I find that my BF of almost a year didn't tell me about his birthday, but his ex knew about it and that hurt me. So people here told me that for some, their birthday isn't a special day, or even a nice day. That for some people, especially those with few friends, it's a disapointment and they prefer to ignore it. My birthday has always been a very special day for me, and this was a new perspective. I talked with Rick. I told him that I saw his ex's message and that it hurt me that she got to wish him a happy birthday and I didn't even know about it. So he told me what you guys told me. That his birthday was never a happy, special day, even in his childhood, and that there was some trauma associated with the day and he chose to just pretend he didn't have a birthday. I told him that I respected that, but maybe we could change that now. I love him, my (our) friends all like him, and he doesn't have to spend his birthday like this. I told him we could do whatever he wanted as a late gift, but he insisted and I kinda let it go, but I felt a bit hurt still. I love him and want him to be happy and do nice things for him. A few days later, he said that he appreciated the gesture, but he really doesn't want to celebrate his birthday, and would prefer if I didn't acknowledge his birthday on years to come. I said ok, but that it pains me that we don't get to do something special for his birthday considering he went all out with mine. And this is where it goes dark and something that caught me completely on the wrong foot. I knew Rick doesn't speak with his father. At all. He doesn't know whether he's alive or dead and doesn't want to. I know he was abusive and aside from the first time I asked, I haven't talked or aksed about his father since. So Rick told me that on his 14th birthday, his father went on one of his rampages. Something pissed him off and he started hitting Rick, wrecked his laptop and phone, hit him so hard with a bottle of beer Rick broke two fingers trying to block it, ripped every item of clothing he owned apart from what he was wearing, and kicked him out into the rain, calling him horrible things I don't even want to type and telling him he didn't want to see him ever again. Rick had to ask for a stranger's phone so he could call his mother and ask her to pick him up. He didn't go to the police, as his father had told him more than once that he would kill his mother if they ever went to the police. This was obviously too much for me, so I started crying and apologizing for pushing him. He said that I didn't know, it wasn't my fault and he understood that I wanted to do something nice for him, but he just doesn't want his birthday acknowledged or celebrated. So now I feel like absolute shit. I didn't know his father was such an evil asshole. Rick is the nicest person I've met, always going out of his way to help those around him, has never raised his voice in all the time I've known him, and has never been anything but nice and friendly to everyone. The thought of his own father doing that to anyone, let alone 14 year old boy Rick, is sickening. Aside from crying a little when he told me, Rick has been acting as usual, but I feel like a piece of garbage for making him dwell on this by being pushy. I'm afraid he'll resent me in the future, or already does. And I've been randomly breaking down crying, imagining what he told me, so HE has been consoling ME. I feel so dumb and selfish. Can I do *anything* to fix this, or should I just mind my business and never bring this up again? <TLDR>: Rick's father basically beat him on his birthday, destroyed everything he owned and kicked him out. I feel like shit for being pushy. Anything I can do to improve this situation?<eco979>: Whenever your insecurities get you, run to him and do the affectionate thing he loves most. One of the best summers of my life was when my then gf read this in a women's magazine but took it to the extreme. She used to run to me, jump in my arms, cover my face in kisses while trying to say \"I love you\". Then she would do something sexual. In public would fondle my junk or my ass. In private, she would give me a bit of a blowjob. Told you, one of the best summers of my life. Since then am crazy for crazy chicks<ColoredFly>: It's not that I'm insecure, is that I have a very vivid imagination, and now I've been \"seeing\" flashes of a little Rick being beaten by his father. He wouldn't hurt a fly. It breaks my heart.<Sanosen>: Stop making it all about you, its his trauma, not yours. If he wants to shove it down and can do that succesfully, respect his wishes and dont bring it up again until he does. Shove it down as well, stay out of his business and really try to stop crying asap. /edit I think if you want to give him a special day, just do it. Dont plan, dont discuss, take a day that hes off and take your boy to town.<NavyScott>: I wish I could upvote this 1000 times. The crying is emotional manipulation.<Sanosen>: Its not her intention though. She doesnt know what to do hence this post. Most people dont understand trauma and try to \"fix the situation\". Or worse, have pity. I hope OP can ascend her personal emotions and do whats right for him.<NavyScott>: I find it hard to believe that isn't her intention considering how much she has made all this about her. Takes a pretty sick person to have the person who was actually abused console them through their crying. Just a massive red flag.<ColoredFly>: You got me again, NavyScott. I'm actually a twisted, evil bitch who wants my boyfriend to be miserable and do whatever I want, using his abusive father as a tool. I'm going to dig up his childhood dog's corpse and put it in his living room, I hope a get a diamond necklace from that. You are the sick person here.<NavyScott>: Oh yeah thanks for showing how great and understanding of a person you are...painting your self as the victim in this is just wrong.<ColoredFly>: You are ACCUSING ME OF USING MY ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND'S FATHER AS A TOOL TO MANIPULATE HIM. How twisted is that. How twisted are you.<NavyScott>: If the shoe fits...<ColoredFly>: Where does it fit? In your twisted image of me, based on the fact that I though my boyfriend didn't celebrate his birthday because he had no close friends, instead of finding out he was beaten and thrown out by his father? Yes, I know pushing his was wrong. He was the one who decided to tell me, and he was the one who brought that up a few days later. I'm having a hard time coping with it, I've been dreaming about him been beaten as a child. But I will not tolerate someone accusing me of such a horrible thing. I never would manipulate him, much less using his abusive father as a tool. That is beyond sick. I want to move past this without making it about me, that's why I'm asking a bunch of strangers on the Internet how to move past this instead of bringing it up again with Rick. Talking about his past with him because I'm feeling devastated by it would be making it about me, and that's what I'm trying to avoid. The shoe fits... I don't want to say where you can try to fit the shoe.<NavyScott>: It's okay next time you decide to step all over your boyfriend just give a nice cry to get out of trouble. You have already made it entirely about you and still are. Oh no poor little you has been having dreams about his abuse... Must be difficult for you. Hopefully he recognizes this massive red flag.<ColoredFly>: &gt;It's okay next time you decide to step all over your boyfriend just give a nice cry to get out of trouble. Yeah, you are projecting. Your ass. Fit the shoe all the way up your ass. Because that's the only place it fits.

Hi there first time posting. So my boyfriend(26M) and I(25F) have been together for at least 6 months now. I kinda feel like he's been distancing himself from me. It's like every time we take a step forward in our relationship, he takes 2 steps back. I do see him regularly but he just doesn't talk to me as much as he used to. I just want better communication. I'll text him and he won't respond yet I see him texting other people regularly. Whereas it feels like the only time he initiates the conversation is when he wants to be intimate. Every time I've talked to him about it he thinks I'm overreacting. He will get better with our communication for a month or so after I talk to him, but then he\u2019ll go back to texting other people again. I know he cares about me and wants to be in a relationship with me, I'm just really insecure. On top of that my family doesn't want me in a relationship with him. They think I deserve and can do much better. They know I love him and I've had feelings for him for several years now. They think I just need to cut ties and move on. I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to continue with our relationship but I've been getting emotionally exhausted from it all.<Anonymous0212>: You have the choice to just accept how he is, and not get what you want/need in this relationship, or talk about how you feel and see how he reacts, how it goes. I have to wonder what are you getting out of this relationship, why do you want to stay in it?<furbaby-mom>: I'm comfortable and enjoy being around him. He knows how to make me smile. I can talk to him about anything and he understands me for the most part. But at the same time, I have tried a couple of times to break it off bc I know deep down this is a toxic relationship. It's just I keep going back bc I felt broken hearted and I'd miss him. I know I'm attached, He's my first and I'm kinda old school but I never intended to have more than one intimate partner. I guess I feel like I need to stay bc of that, and at the same time I feel like no one else will ever want me.<Anonymous0212>: You sound like the classic case of someone who experienced abuse or was around some other kind of dysfunction growing up that caused you to believe you don\u2019t deserve to be in a healthy, happy relationship, and perhaps causes you to work much harder at trying to make a dysfunctional situation work than your partner is willing to do \u2014 i.e., low self-esteem and/or [codependency. ](http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/co-dependency) Added to the cultural fantasy of \u201cfalling in love\u201d with someone when we\u2019re pretty much fresh into adulthood and then staying with them for the rest of our lives, this sounds like you\u2019ve given yourself a prison sentence \u2014 but the good news is that you hold the only key to your own cell. I didn\u2019t meet the Keeper Husband until after three other long-term relationships, including two abusive marriages, when was in my late 40\u2019s and had two teenagers. If I\u2019ve learned anything from all of this, *it\u2019s to see relationships as opportunities to fine-tune what works for us and what doesn\u2019t, what we want and what we don\u2019t want.* I chose to learn from each relationship until I finally reached the point of realizing I deserved far better, then set high standards and committed to myself that I wasn\u2019t going to settle for less. And I didn\u2019t waver, when I met a man with big enough red flags I said no thanks. The second wusband wasn\u2019t as bad as the first one (*which was the height of my improved standards the first time around*, now looking back I can hardly believe it) and I upgraded again \u2014 by a LOT. The path to having truly happy, *healthy* relationships isn\u2019t for sissies, but it\u2019s completely doable. It takes a willingness to face the reality of what isn\u2019t working for us in our current relationship, identifying what we grew up with that\u2019s causing it, having the motivation to do something about it and the faith that it can be done. An excellent start is the book Getting The Love You Want by Harville Hendrix. The whole first part is about how we develop emotional wounds in childhood that cause us to be the most attracted to certain types of people when we grow up (IMO the reasons are equally complicated and elegant.) The second part is exercises designed to help us identify exactly what those patterns are, along with a dialogue process to enable us to have a completely different kind of conversation with our partners when those emotional wounds get triggered during the course of the relationship, *which isn\u2019t only unavoidable but a necessarily part of the healing process.* DH and I have both spent our fair share of time in therapy individually and together, to help us work on identifying and healing the underlying emotional issues that caused us both to choose toxic relationships in the past, and which were getting in the way of us creating something different this time around. It\u2019s a lot of work, and digging through all the sh*t from my past definitely isn\u2019t the most fun I\u2019ve ever had, but **omg is the pay-off ever worth it**, for each of us personally and for us as a couple. I really hope you\u2019ve been at least somewhat inspired and can see this as a possibility for yourself. We\u2019re talking about the entire rest of your life here, so *how do you want to feel about it when you\u2019re looking back at the end?* Equally important, what kind of role model do you want to be for your future children? Why not someone who doesn\u2019t give up on healing and happiness despite a truly crappy childhood, like the kind of role model my children have literally thanked me for being?<furbaby-mom>: Thank you. I know it'll be tough but I need to move on. I already know he's not going to change. I just need to stick with my decision and not go back to him every time he says he misses me.<Anonymous0212>: If you can identify and start shifting the underlying issue at all, that may help.<furbaby-mom>: Thank you. It's nice to get an opinion from another point of view. I'm gonna work on it.<Anonymous0212>: I heard an analogy once, that we can keep popping the balloons or we can open the hand that\u2019s holding them.

It may seem shallow on the surface but I think it's a symptom of deeper problems, that your partner does not care about his health, nor about being attractive for you, nor his own self-image. He should get counseling, then both of you as a couple.<throwaway19999767>: I have been thinking about whether I\u2019d be better off on my own. I\u2019m not a fitness freak but I\u2019d be mortified if I was like that and I\u2019d be working super hard to be the best I could be. I feel like he takes it for granted that I put on lingerie and cut my hair for him when he doesn\u2019t even use a treadmill... But I love more than that about him, so I\u2019ll consider the counseling. Thank you kind stranger.<Magameme>: I wouldn't throw away what you have. If he is honestly a good man and you love him I wouldn't give up on him. As you get older you there will be less options and more people will have baggage. Unfortunately you are in your sexual prime and his was over 10 years ago (scientifically). I think the question is what do you want? A guaranteed loving marriage with a good man and shitty sex or good sex with the rest up in the air. Ten years from now the sex will be less important and 10 more after that and you'd rather be sleeping. I think with the right motivation he'd be able to lose it.<coastalshelves>: This is such bad advice. People don't stop having sex at 40 or 50. OP is only 31, her life isn't over.<Magameme>: You think breaking off a 10 year marriage that is otherwise a good one is a better option? Really?<coastalshelves>: She feels taken for granted and sex is an important part of the relationship to her. So it doesn't sound like the marriage is that good.<houston_oilers>: This is just garbage Reddit bullshit advice.<coastalshelves>: I personally think life's too short to stay with someone you don't want to have sex with when you're only 30 years old. I'm not saying everyone has to feel the same.<schmeggplant>: Agreed. She could have 70 years left. She's clearly done (and is still doing) everything she can to make this work, why should it be on her to settle and suffer if he's not willing to work with her?<TheBrownWelsh>: &gt; She could have 70 years left. I'm not saying they should break up over weight gain, but that fact you stated is a big reason to bring it up. Why would you want to stay with someone who might drop dead *from their own poor choices* at a time when it would be really hard to start over? This is one of the main reasons I'm trying to get back in shape in my mid-30s; I don't want to leave my wife and child high &amp; dry because I was too content to drink and eat and be lazy. I was perfectly happy with myself until our kid showed up, but now I'm terrified of dying early.<schmeggplant>: Agreed. Your 30s are a pretty important time for everyone, but especially for women. If OP wants a family (presumably with an equally involved and capable partner) this is really a critical time to address whether her husband fits that role and can be there for her or their future children in the longrun.

So, here's my situation - I'm 37m, single dad. My sister is 35, her husband is 38. My sister can be hard to get along with - she tends to be really demanding. She used to do this with me until I shut it down, she doesn't try anymore, but she is really demanding with her husband and her husband is intentionally hard to get along with. A typical scene: Last week, their kid had a birthday party. My sister worked her butt off, her husband stood around not helping, claiming that if he helped, then whatever he did wrong would be his fault. He spent the whole party bitching about my sister. My sister spent the whole party running around and making cutting remarks about him not helping. This was all in front of tons of people - it was fucking embarrassing. Another situation that might help illustrate - we all went to a theme park last year. They were miserable and fighting the whole time. I took my kids home, 3 hours away, about 1/2 way through the trip because they were making us all miserable. Since then, I've refused to go on any trips with them. About 3 months ago, my sister told me that he broke down a bathroom door trying to get to her. I confronted him about this (tactfully.) He told me how he really loved my sister but it was hard to get along with her, and that he broke down the door because she threatened to hurt herself (an empty threat that I knew immediately was for drama, and I think he did too, but still.) I talked to him that day about how he wanted to be perceived, if he really wanted to be this guy who was impatient and pissy all the time. I suggested anger management, and I told him that I took an online anger management class online once and that it really helped me. We ended our conversation telling each other that we love and appreciate each other. They're a lawyer and a schoolteacher. They're well educated. I'm a psychologist. Just some background info. Today my sister tells me that while they were on vacation with my mom, her husband cussed everyone out and then took my sisters car and drove 3 hours home, stranding her with my mom. Apparently last night, he got pissed about something and started driving erratically and almost hit someone with the car. So basically, after a few months reprieve, he's back to being a total dick. I told my sister this morning that I had suggested anger management, she asked me to suggest it again. The problem is, I don't think it's my place. I think they're at the point now where if they can't get along for 2 days on vacation, there needs to be some intervention. Professional. Not me, because I'm biased. How do you guys deal with your siblings marital bullshit? I don't want my sister's husband to think that I'm going to come after him and try to talk it out every time he throws a hissy fit. I wish he would just grow up. But I've got a history of failed relationships also, I'm no expert. Do you get involved? I didn't even witness these events, but when I told my sister that I didn't think he respected me enough to listen to me, that I wasn't getting involved, she says 'yeah, no one is.' You know, as if I'm expected to. TL;DR: Sister wants me to jump in on her relationship issues, I don't feel it's my place.<mr1347>: Something has to give. From the looks of it both your sister and her husband are displaying toxic behavior that requires immediate attention. Problem is both think they are right and the other is in the wrong. Even if you did get involved nothing would improve unless they are both willing to work together. It also seems like it's easier for you to excuse your sister's behavior because it's familiar but the husband's behavior seems less acceptable because you are not used to it. Here's my advice: do not involve yourself further, encourage both to seek help on their own and together as couple. Wash your hands of this mess and walk away.<TheL0nePonderer>: Thanks. My sister is a character, she has a great heart, but her lawyer training sort of awakened a beast that was already there - she has no tact, she says shit without considering the implications, etc. I don't know if she does this because when at work, she has to rein that in and be tactful and thoughtful, and she just doesn't want to do it outside of work, but she's the boss, in every situation, for sure. Hell, she's MY boss, but the 'power dynamic' is a little skewed there because I'm still her older, wiser brother. I don't excuse her behavior, I just feel like his behavior is frustrating her constantly. She DOES bear the brunt of all the work as well as moneymaking in the household. He still makes no effort with the kids, to the point that my sister won't leave the kids home without my 17 year old being there (which is a little dramatic, her husband can handle it, but it's how my sister feels.) His attitude is horrible, and in my opinion, he doesn't realize what he has, a wife and kids who love him and want the best for him. But I imagine that's hard to see if you're constantly being berated or nothing's ever good enough. Add to that the reality that his dad is a southern preacher, he was raised in a 'the man's the boss' outlook, and now her being the primary breadwinner is emasculating for him. Meanwhile, I'm a single dad, I spend every moment with my kids and have raised them by myself most their lives, I take care of his kids more than HE does - I don't think I'm exactly what he sees as a role model or someone to respect 'as a man.' I do recognize my bias, and I do call her out when she's clearly being the issue. I think you're right, I need to resist the request to get involved, her husband knows I'm here if he wants to talk.", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 2.3333333333}

Am I incapable of love? Hey, idk if this is appropriate on this page but here goes nothing... I (21 F) have never been in a relationship and sometimes I think I should be worried. I change from \u201cI don\u2019t need a man, I\u2019m independent\u201d to \u201cI want a boyfriend, am I incapable of love\u201d nearly every week. I have been \u201cin a thing\u201d with a couple of guys in my life, I nearly properly dated two of them, but in the end I left them and broke it off for one reason or another. The most recent was last year and we went on a number of dates but I broke it off bc he gave me too many red flags (homophobia, sexism, and racism to name a few). When I broke it off I haven\u2019t even let him kiss me yet only hug. Sometimes I think I\u2019m too picky, both with looks and personality. I think my brain actively looks for red flags and as soon as I find one I want to get out of there. I also think I\u2019m partially \u201cdamaged goods\u201d. I didn\u2019t let that guy kiss me bc the last guy I kissed and ended up sleeping with \u201cstealthed\u201d me and made me worry I had an STI for months. The only other guy I slept with in my life was a few years before that and he kept hitting me up, only for me to find out he got a girlfriend towards the end of us hanging out, I cut it off instantly. I think a mixture of these two experiences, and the fact that my parents have been in a manipulative, verbally abusive, and controlling relationship my whole life and are STILL together, have caused me to have some issues with getting into a relationship and letting people into my life. I also think I could be just too self-conscious. With my body, with my lack of sexual experience, or with my (self perceived) trash kissing skills. I sometimes think this may not be the case though as when I was thinner I still felt like this, when I was more sexually experienced (e.g didn\u2019t have a two year sexual hiatus), I still felt like this... One thing for sure is I know I\u2019m NOT asexual, I feel like this is easy to figure out for me and I liked sex with guys, I like sex and feeling sexy etc. so I think that answers that. Sometimes though, I worry if maybe I\u2019m aromantic.... I don\u2019t know for sure, I definitely like the cute convos and lovey-dovey shit that leads up to a relationship, but I never let it get any further than that. I am not good at being open both physically and emotionally, I am not good at physical affection, I don\u2019t even like to be hugged most of the time. As frustrating and confusing as this all is, I still want to be in a relationship sometimes, and I still want to be loved and someone to show me physical affection. So I can maybe learn to reciprocate it. What\u2019s wrong with me. Am I damaged goods or am I incapable of romantic love. Is my stupid brain self sabotaging everything bc I\u2019ve been hurt before and don\u2019t want to be hurt again. I don\u2019t know. All I know is people mention to me that it\u2019s weird I\u2019ve never been in a relationship, mostly my family. Luckily for me most of the time I\u2019m fine with being alone for the time being, but not forever. And as I get older I worry it may end up being forever...<kaatie80>: It sounds more like you've learned that high walls are necessary to stay safe. I don't think you're incapable of love. Plus, homophobia and all that other stuff are totally valid reasons not to be with someone.<PsychWarrior02>: Thank you \u2665\ufe0f maybe I need to reduce my walls a little but not too much as to let red flags slide :)<kaatie80>: That sounds like a good idea :) It can be hard to find the right level of boundary to have.

I responded that I thought they would look great on her and she proceeded to go off on me saying that she is not cheap or a whore and she doesn't like the pressure to be something she is not. To clarify, the panties were not extremely risque. They were a heart back, low rise thong. &amp;#x200B; We talked when I got home and she insinuated that the panties may not even be for her. She has never once not trusted me and I am not sure where the distrust is coming from. The conversation did not go far as we were both upset and did not want to get into a fight. &amp;#x200B; I am very confused about her response. We have a healthy sex life and I have no idea what I did wrong by trying to get her something sexy. I have never worried about infidelity but her response was very out of the ordinary. Should I be worried about her response? Could it be an inkling of something bigger or did I just miss the mark in getting her a thong?<missSpiffy2>: Could it be the fact that you found these panties on gonewild presumably on another girl? Idk, I'd be a little offended too.<canitakemybraoffyet>: And all it would make me think was that gonewild girl looked SO hot in those panties it made you buy them. That's all I'd be thinking while wearing them. How hot you find some other chick. Bleh, that feeling is the exact opposite of sexy.<raburner>: So interesting. As a dude, if my gf bought me something she saw on another guy and liked it, I'd be thinking \"Sweet! New \\[item\\]!\"<canitakemybraoffyet>: So if your gf was watching porn, and saw some cock holder that looked just SO good on that porn star's giant cock that she had to buy it and try to get you to wear it, despite that being totally out of character and not your style at all, you wouldn't think AT ALL that she's trying to use you to fulfill a fantasy about that other guy?<DoobsandStuff>: It's a thong... a cock holder isn't even in the same ball park. thongs or lingerie are advertised everyday and seen by men everywhere.<canitakemybraoffyet>: I mean, it's an item worn on another dude's naked genitalia who made it look so appealing to your girlfriend while she was jerking off to that dude wearing that item, that she spent the time to search it out on the internet and buy it. Pretty identical scenario imo. And idk about you but I don't get heart cutout thongs advertised to me daily lmao, that's something you buy in a sex shop, not target.<DoobsandStuff>: Not at all. Cock holders are not something the average man wears everyday. Thongs are something women wear everyday, a lot of women do. It's not even remotely a good comparison. Plus, thongs are advertised openly. Just found one on Victorias Secret. Easily google-able<canitakemybraoffyet>: Okay, let's go with a speedo. I dated a guy who wore that style undies daily, so does that make it a good comparison? They're SUPER sexual and basically an elevated cock holder haha. SO, if your gf was jacking off to some giant dick online, and his giant cock and perfect body in that speedo enticed her to scour the internet for THAT EXACT PAIR and buy them for you in a hope you'd start wearing it like the porn star that stuck with her so much, you'd be 100% not insecure about that in the slightest?<quartersnacksdeluxe>: Lots of presumptions in this argument. &gt; giant cock &gt; perfect body &gt; porn star that stuck with her so much &gt; 100% not insecure Sure. Maybe a few % insecure.

Totally normal and typical of the average woman?<quartersnacksdeluxe>: Well, if they are at the top, I agree that many people had to find them attractive enough to upvote. But I do not think they are abnormally attractive. I do not think the analogy is there, if that is what you are getting at. Was there is a comment where OP explains he was sorting by top, or browsing by top? If gf was browsing ladyboners and saw some underwear she thought would look good on me, I would not be insecure. I think that is a more realistic comparison. Top post or not, even.<canitakemybraoffyet>: Okay, now imagine you open some mail to find a type of underwear that you'd be EXTREMELY uncomfortable wearing, like a super-tight speedo ouch. Only to find out that your gf saw some dude wear them while jacking off on ladyboners and got so turned on by his package in them she bought them so you could start dressing like him, too. That would just, not faze you in the tiniest? Even if it wouldn't, you can't sympathize that to a lot of people, that would sting?<quartersnacksdeluxe>: You have a bad habit of asking questions in a way that seems like you a presupposing. It sounds like you are much more puritan than me. I also do not know why you are trying to convince me that I would be insecure when I am clearly saying I would not be. I also can understand that other people get insecure about things. I am just pointing out that you do this: &gt; person: i wouldn\u2019t get upset if person did x &gt; you: x, but actually x plus other more extreme variants wouldn\u2019t upset you???<canitakemybraoffyet>: Hahahaha I'm sorry, I thought we were talking about OP and trying to help him gain perspective on his wife's thoughts, not yours. <OP>: What's up with my wife? <Person>: Well, maybe this is what she's thinking. <You>: No, that's not at all what I think. <Person>: Right, but can't you imagine how OPs wife might think that? <You>: But.... But no because that's not what I personally think. <Person>: okay, but imagine it like this. Now can you maybe understand how someone could think that way. <You>: THATS NOT WHAT I THINK Geeezie petes. Are you this self centered about everything in your life?<quartersnacksdeluxe>: You were asking me whether or not I would be insecure.

We had a trip planned for this upcoming week to go to Spain and I was going to ask her to marry me - she was well aware this was going to happen. She always told me there was nothing she wanted more. She tells me she was drunk and it \u201cjust happened\u201d. I\u2019m so hurt right now. She\u2019s said how sorry she is many times, and I believe her, but I feel so betrayed. We\u2019ve had a great relationship up to this point, I\u2019ve loved every minute of it. To add to it she tells me before that how she confided in him that she was scared of spending the rest of her life with someone and how she was unsure about our relationship. This hurts me to my core to think that someone I wanted to spend forever with could do this to me. Out of all the women I\u2019ve ever dated she was the one I was least worried about this happening with. She tells me that it was the biggest mistake she\u2019s ever made and how she regrets it, I just don\u2019t know if I can move on.

Thats fucking real advice that someone who lived through it would give<SirNarwhal>: No, it's really not, and I can say this from someone who's lived through this situation in their friend circle multiple times. It's a childish and emotional reaction and shows a complete and total lack of maturity especially to resort as low as calling her a whore for literally sharing a connection with someone she had shared a connection with before in a moment of weakness. If you can't handle that shit, you're not ready for marriage and being there in sickness and health.<sharkeisha_n0>: No, if you\u2018re gonna still hang out and kiss your ex, you arent ready to be married. Sickness and health doesnt include adultery. Your friend circle must be full of doormats, because my friends will not hesitate to use the word \u201ewhore\u201c when dumping a cheating SO. In our 30s. Only a fool would trust her ever again. Guess i see where you and your friends stand on the topic<SirNarwhal>: Actually, I didn't comment on it one way or the other with how my friend circle handed it, just commented on the maturity level. Y'all might be in your 30s, but you're definitely not mature. Both parties involved in this aren't ready for marriage and also in current culture it's utterly bizarre to see kissing as cheating deserving of vitriol when that should be reserved for full on intentionally emotional cheating that usually ends in directly wanting to hurt their partner and also includes full sexual contact of some sort. This isn't high school, this is a relationship with someone OP presumably cared about and had feelings for and instead of talking to her like a normal rational human would, he instead resorted to calling her a whore for being a complex human being as well and switched all of the focus on me me me instead of, \"Why would she feel this way, was it intentional, is she actually remorseful, did she intend to hurt me?\" and so on. Also that right there is why I believe this entire post is fake, but that's another point entirely.<sharkeisha_n0>: So yeah, you and your friends are doormats. You think this kind of shit is an accident? You are a naive bunch. You can keep writing a book to me as a reply, but there is nothing immature about having a 0 tolerance policy towards your wife\u2018s tongue being in another man\u2018s mouth, and whore is a totally fitting insult<SirNarwhal>: That's uh... not being a doormat at all. I'm saying that by having such an intense and anger driven response is a massive overreaction and incredibly detrimental to how literally anyone with a semblance of maturity responds to a situation.<sharkeisha_n0>: Yes, that is being a doormat. When someone betrays you, people of principle tend to feel resentment. Doormats will make excuses for the offending party, and forgive. You can try to link that to \u201ematurity\u201c if you want. Whatever. I think it\u2018s immature to stay w someone obviously untrustworthy, like OP\u2018s whore wife.

I understood you fine. Your friends wives act like whores and you sympathize w them. Doormat. Not hard to last 10 years when you have no spine. If i ever get married, you can bet my wife\u2018s tongue will stay out of her ex\u2018s m\u00f6uth... or she\u2018ll be the ex.

Got it<SirNarwhal>: OP\u2019s situation involves bf/gf situation and that\u2019s what it\u2019s been with my friends. Learn to read ya fucking 6 year old. Or are you just gonna respond by calling me a doormat and acting macho yet again when you\u2019re the one extremely uncomfortable in your own skin. Seriously just stop fucking responding and go actually live your life since you have the societal skills of a fucking invalid.<sharkeisha_n0>: So you're married, but your friends are unmarried, but you're all doormats. There. Fixed. This is based on your acceptance of \"moments of weakness\" and your aversion to the word \"whore\" when it is totally appropriate. Enjoy your probably shit marriage, if you are advising OP to eat shit like you have grown accustomed to, you doormat<SirNarwhal>: Thanks for the laugh and the reminder that most people in this sub are 16 year olds that have never had any relationship with anyone ever let alone a friendship. None of us are doormats, in many situations the couples broke up, but they didn't resort to name calling, they talked things out like normal rational fucking adults. Also, my marriage is amazing and literally everyone that meets me and my wife tells us that we're their ideal relationship. Why? *Because we fucking communicate and aren't emotionally stunted sad excuses of human beings like you.*<sharkeisha_n0>: Sure, pal. You can call me names because I'm calling you out for your doormat mindset and thats mature.... but if your wife kissed another man, you'd be \"mature\" and swallow it. You even broke out the italics! Sure, pal. I almost believe you are saying that to try to convince me and not yourself that you're not a doormat lol enjoy eating shit in your \"ideal\" marriage you doormat hahahhaha<SirNarwhal>: Actually, we've dabbled in an open relationship and she literally kissed other men in front of me (and I other women in front of her) and I didn't give a flying fuck at all, nor did she, so uh, where's your doormat argument bullshit now? Again, this all completely goes back to immaturity, which you have in droves.<sharkeisha_n0>: Lol what a doormat, you're even proud of sharing your wife w other men. your advice that OP's wife isn't a whore makes a ton more sense now!<SirNarwhal>: You really are something special; I never said anything regarding either of those, all I said was to *communicate* and that jumping to calling someone you love a whore is not *mature* because *it's not*. I can go on all fucking day if you'd like re-writing this to you in terms a 2 year old would understand since that's about where you're at now. You're in your terrible twos throwing a terrible tantrum.<sharkeisha_n0>: Yeah I bet you do have all day in your ideal marriage. Is it someone else's turn with your wife tonight? Hahahha only a doormat like you could possibly hold the stance you do. After 10 years, no wonder. Eating shit must be an acquired taste", "num_messages": 26, "avg_score": 694.3076923077}

I\u2019m scared that he is not giving him a proper amount of food. Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9zbd5/i_15f_found_out_my_stepdad_34_is_only_feeding_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app \u2014\u2014\u2014 Since I got a lot of advice saying I should contact a third party, I will. I\u2019m planning on talking to a counselor on Monday about this for further consultation. Other comments said that the counselor may call CPS and since I\u2019m afraid, a counselor will be the best source of help. I\u2019m also planning on taking care of my brother for the rest of the weekend. My stepdad usually takes my brother with him when he gets home, since my little brother rushes to him. I\u2019ll make sure to listen to his car pulling up, and take my brother in my room so he won\u2019t be able to to run to my stepdad, since my little brother can\u2019t open doors yet. Also, my stepdad takes care of my bro exclusively since that is his biological son, my bro is technically my halfbrother but I refer to him as just by brother. This morning, I fed my brother two bowls of noodle soup and water. I\u2019m planning on giving him beans and tortillas for lunch, and other solid foods, and water as a drink, since that\u2019s what is healthiest for him. My brother is well fed for the time being. I\u2019ll keep urging my mom to do something. Until I talk to a counselor and my mom is still unconcerned, I\u2019ll continue to make sure I take care of and feed my brother exclusively while my mom is away at work, since she usually feeds my brother well. Thanks for all of you guys advice. \u2665\ufe0f _mini update:_ I talked to my mom right now, and she said she talked to my stepdad about this the last time I told her (yesterday). I thought she was unconcerned, but I was wrong. I know she is telling the truth because today I noticed my stepdad was feeding my brother solid foods, I saw a dirty shirt of my brother\u2019s on the drying machine shortly after my stepdad returned to his room with my bro after being in the kitchen. I also saw no PediaSure bottles. All seems to be resolved!! :) To clear things up, I decided to opt for giving my bro prepared meals in the fridge instead to solve this problem, but it seemed to have been unnecessary since my stepdad gave him food on his own.<Bowsermama>: Wanted to add, if you are concerned about him eating while your stepdad has him since it seems like he is just heating up the bottles of Pediasure, you could also premake some food for him, like tortillas and beans and leave it on a plate in the fridge. That way you can mention to your stepdad, hey I left lunch for \\*2yo\\* so all you have to do is heat it up for him. Maybe he is just lazy?<turtleterrace12>: Yes, my stepdad is lazy. My mom has noticed that my stepdad only gives my bro PediaSure, and has said the same thing. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the only thing my stepdad feeds my bro as I\u2019ve mentioned in my previous comments etc, since he also gets junk food from the gas station/take out food from mom\u2019s workplace, so he might also be sharing that with him too. I\u2019m not sure how much food my bro is getting though, so I\u2019m a little worried, and It\u2019s still unhealthy either way. I\u2019ll make sure to take your suggestion, and hopefully the problem is resolved this way instead of taking bigger measures. Thank you. :)<xxshidoshi>: You should really confront your stepdad and ask if he feeds your little bro and what he feeds him. No point contacting cps if your stupid 34 yr old stepdad doesn\u2019t know (even tho he should)<turtleterrace12>: Ok, I\u2019ll confront him. I\u2019m sort of afraid to do so (social anxiety) but I will. I feel like my stepdad probably isn\u2019t aware of what he is doing, and is not surprising since he is not well educated. My mom told me he dropped out of school around at the end of elementary school. <xxshidoshi>: Ummmmmmm definitely then. While you\u2019re at it tell your mum (who is being an idiot - no offence) to educate the father of her son <turtleterrace12>: I\u2019ve told my mom twice. But I\u2019ll tell her again later today this time, and provide her with some research so she\u2019ll be convinced, and hopefully this will get her concerned. Also, you\u2019ve mentioned to take a picture of the bottles, and here it is: <https>://imgur.com/a/WKmHH1f My mom told me that some of the bottles in the sink might be from the day before. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af<xxshidoshi>: Imagine being a father and thinking this is okay<goalstopper28>: Yeah, I'm years away from even thinking of having a kid and this seems like a no brainer to me.

On the way to breakfast, the topic of bisexuality came up. Now, I've always considered myself bisexual, but I've never been open about it. I tend to speak in really ambiguous, vague terms when it comes to my sexuality (like saying \"my future partner\" or \"the person I'll marry\" instead of gendered terms), and just don't really talk about it with anyone. It's weird because a lot of people just seem to sense my sexuality, like some sort of bisexual gaydar, and as a result I've never really come out to anyone- the people who know just guessed. &amp;#x200B; So, when the topic of bisexuality came up in conversation, I was pretty supportive as you could probably imagine. I didn't let on immediately that I considered myself bisexual, I kind of wanted to hear what he had to say. He said, \"I understand being gay or straight, but bisexuality doesn't exist. It's just a fetish.\" I got quiet. I asked him what lead him to this conclusion. He said \"you don't see any bisexual old people.\" I disagreed with him, citing that you often can't tell if someone's bisexual right away, especially if they're married. They kind of have to tell you or talk about their dating history. I pulled up a list of famous bisexual people and read off some of the bigger names, focusing on people who were from previous generations. Oscar Wilde, Malcolm X, David Bowie, Grace Jones, Marlene Dietrich, Virginia Woolf, etc. I mean, these are people who embraced their sexuality in a time period where it really wasn't common. He brushed this off, saying \"Well, if you're famous and you come out once, even if you're just going through a phase, people will label you with that forever\". I mean... these people all had a lengthy history of relationships with men and women. Alright, I guess Oscar Wilde's relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas was an elaborate publicity stunt. &amp;#x200B; Throughout my life, I've heard \"bisexuality is just a phase\" and \"it's just some trendy thing\" and it makes me doubt myself more and more. My parents have even told me that a bisexual person would not stay married for long, and would not attend the wedding of someone openly bisexual. I'm still grappling with my own self-acceptance of my sexuality. I've only dated men so far because it's the most comfortable for me. I don't have to be nervous about what my parents or friends will think, even though I *know* that that they'd come around and be okay with it eventually if I started dating a woman. I know it's completely irrational but I've just been scared to death of confronting it. With men, I'm really confident and smooth, but with the ladies, it's like my voice just gives out when I stammer that I like their hair. In recent years, I've become more accepting of my feelings, and have become more open to setting dating apps to both sexes, but I'm still so nervous around and intimidated by women (in a romantic sense) and the idea of actually giving myself permission to explore this part of myself that I've never found the strength to push myself in that direction. There's always just that dumb little part of my brain that parrots the disparaging things I've heard about bisexuality just being a phase that holds me back. Again, I'm improving and slowly gaining the courage to be myself, it's just something I've been working on. Because it's something that I've been grappling with behind closed doors, I'd rather figure shit out internally before I come out loud and proud to absolutely everyone, and that included my boyfriend. It wasn't that I kept this a secret, but the topic had never come up before now. By the way, I don't want to make it seem like my biggest issue is with my sexuality- it's a really small part of me, but it's still something I've consistently thought about and struggled with. &amp;#x200B; We got to the breakfast shop, and I let it slip that I identify as bisexual. I rarely even say that out loud, so you could imagine that it was quite monumental for me to reveal that to someone I cared about quite a lot. I told him all of the above, then explained that this sort of rhetoric is hurtful to me, because it brings me a few steps back on this personal journey. I even mentioned that after every relationship I've ever been in, I always swore to myself that the next one would be a woman, but I was never able to grow a pair and actually make it happen, because I was just so damn irrationally scared. He shrugged and said, \"well, that's probably because you're just straight\". I immediately burst into inconsolable tears. It was like absolutely everything that has ever been said to me regarding my sexuality and every hurt feeling I had about it just came out in a wave of emotions. He apologized profusely, but I just sobbed and sobbed because in this vulnerable moment of courage about this thing that I'd been so scared to confront had just been completely and totally invalidated. This was the first time I had actually formally come out to anyone, and it was shut down. This was a moment where I just needed to be heard by the person I love, and it didn't happen. Much later, when I felt I had calmed down enough to properly articulate myself, I explained again how I felt invalidated, and why I had cried so hard when he said that to me. He apologized for making me feel that way. I asked him if he still maintained the opinion that he'd had earlier, and he told me \"yes, I still think bisexuality is a phase\". &amp;#x200B; I don't know what to do or say. Obviously, bisexuality isn't my entire personality, but it's still a part of who I am. How can I talk with him about this? What do I do moving forward? Does anyone have advice? [deleted]: He has different opinions. Who cares? Does it really matter?<WolvesKeepYouWarm>: What the fuck? It totally matters if someone you love writes off something that affects your very being. [deleted]: I don\u2019t think it affects her very being. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s her identity. I think it just is.<WolvesKeepYouWarm>: It doesn\u2019t have to be her whole identity but it\u2019s part of who she is, and that qualifies as something that just \u201cis\u201d and exists. Could you be around someone you care deeply for who constantly dismisses a feeling you have? It would be terribly difficult and annoying [deleted]: I guess it just doesn\u2019t compute to me because I feel like sexuality is a spectrum and everyone is bisexual to a degree. What is it that makes OP so sure and rigid in her identity as bisexual? We know she hasn\u2019t dated any women, has she kissed them? Or anything? Or does she just find some attractive. There\u2019s plenty of men I find attractive, doesn\u2019t mean I want to fuck em or identify as bisexual <WolvesKeepYouWarm>: I totally agree with this, but the key is she does want to have sex and/or have a intimate relationship with women. I find lots of women attractive, honestly moreso than men on a day to day, but I don\u2019t want to fuck them or date them. That is the difference. And there exist SO many people who are straight that can\u2019t even comprehend finding the same sex remotely attractive so it might be more difficult for you to understand how struggling it can be to be told \u201cit\u2019s probably just a phase.\u201d No, she likes women full stop. She doesn\u2019t have to have a sexual encounter to prove it. [deleted]: I guess I can\u2019t. When my wife told me she thought she was slightly bi sexual I said \u201cyeah tits are great huh?\u201d I think in some ways the need to identify and label everything, genders, sexuality (hereto, homo, pansexual, demisexual, bisexual) leads to issues like this. Because now it can\u2019t be that OP is a woman who finds women sexually attractive, now she\u2019s \u201cbisexual,\u201d and it\u2019s a thing. I think everyone should just do whatever they want<WolvesKeepYouWarm>: I agree but we are not at that level of awareness socially and likely will not be there for a long time.", "num_messages": 9, "avg_score": 0.0}

I\u2019ve come to cherishing her and getting over protective about the simplest things, I\u2019m always there for her I make sure she\u2019s alright, check up on her from time to time but she recently friend zoned me but I still care for her the way I used to, I don\u2019t care if we\u2019re just friends I fucking well love her.

You\u2019ve put her on such a high pedestal and I\u2019m sure she knows as well that she has to make pretty much zero effort to get your attention. <Edit>: I\u2019m not an advocate of ghosting, but to \u201cget out\u201d of the friendzone when you can\u2019t really is pretty simple.. stop talking to her and initiating everything.<davidrip155>: Fairs, I\u2019ve had friends say the same thing, Ive always been open about my feelings I don\u2019t care what people think I was only coming to reddit to see if they were right. And now I know they basically are but I still don\u2019t understand how I can let her go I forgot to add a lot of details about all this especially the fact that I owe her because she got me through a hard time in my life.<Hiurawego>: I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s a bad person, and she obviously has a very fine line with communicating emotions. She\u2019s fine talking about you and your thoughts, but has difficulties communicating about herself, and that\u2019s a red flag for me in any relationship. If she can\u2019t communicate how she\u2019s feeling right now, what happens when you do something that\u2019ll upset her down the road in the relationship but she can\u2019t communicate that with you?<davidrip155>: Now that I think about it, she only talks to me about stuff upsetting her not to do with me, she was mad at me the other day and I could tell she kept saying \u201coh no we\u2019re fine\u201d that resulted in us not talking for a couple days and her messaging me because she wanted to keep are friendship alive. My friend (her ex) showed me his and her dms and she would say she was fine to him then I would compare mine and she would say how mad she was at him. In the long run that ended there relationship completely, and I feel bad because it\u2019s my fault I told him that she was crying the other day and got me to look after her why the fuck are you not helping your her boyfriend for fuck sake.<Hiurawego>: Show that you actually care. I\u2019m not sure if you do. But like I said, you need to seriously communicate your emotions and show her that you care and that you want to be there for her. Only say it if you mean it. When you listen to her, don\u2019t have your phone out or have anything else on your mind besides her<davidrip155>: I do care, I\u2019m not rude I don\u2019t have my phone out when I\u2019m having a conversation that can be seen as disrespectful, also she\u2019s the only thing I can keep my mind on. I think the biggest problem is I get very very fucking anxious and jealous I don\u2019t know my mental health is screwed, she did help that\u2019s probably the reason I\u2019ve grown to love her so much having the feeling that someone actually cared about me but now my mental health has just gotten worse littered with jealousy and insecurity.<Hiurawego>: I\u2019ve given you my answer several times: communicate ALL of this to her and see what happens. Open and honest communication will resolve the issue. Be warned that sometimes \u201cresolving\u201d doesn\u2019t lead to the desired outcome though<davidrip155>: Yes I understand this has really helped to be honest sorry for taking your time<Hiurawego>: Don\u2019t worry about it bro.

We had our ups and downs but we were pretty stable and happy. We would see each other nearly every day and travel frequently. About a week ago, something.. changed. For the bad. We began to have really bad fights over the smallest things. For example, I have a bad habit of tossing things onto my bed or in my car. She would get overly mad and start acting really weird. I wouldn't talk to her for a couple days because she was so furious with me. After a couple of days, she would calm down and apologize. This went on for about a week (3 fights in total) and finally, we had the fight to end all fights over TEXT!

The counselor told her I was bad for her and that she needed to break up with me (Sounds like this sub lol). &amp;#x200B; She blew up over text on me telling me I was terrible, acted like a women and I was a generally horrible person.

We had sex actually pretty soon when we decided to be together. And I would not call it sexual assault, I just consider that this other guy really didn't respect the limits that I established. Anyways, since he is my friend I was able to talk to him about the incident and he blamed everything on him and told me that it was not he's intention to hurt me. I wanted to get the Plan B to be extra secure nothing will happen to me. I am pretty paranoid of getting pregnant, so I would have gotten it anyway. The fact is that I did not enjoy being with this other guy, I felt kind of forced and I didn't have the best of times. I think it's my fault at the end", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 1.3333333333}

I setup video chats with her tonight and tomorrow night and to visit her on the 5th. I\u2019m having a hard time figuring out how to handle the situation. How to reassure her that I didn\u2019t disappear because I didn\u2019t love her. That I missed her as though a piece of myself was gone. For backstory her mother and I went through a terribly messy divorce. She moved back in with her mom about two hours away after a knockdown drag out fight. She quit her job working for the state after the birth of our second child. Afterward she did everything she could to drive me away from the children. Not showing up to pickups at the half way point. Refusing to drive to the half way point. Refusing to let me take my son prior to him being 3. Requiring me to drive the full four hours and \u201cbuild\u201d a relationship with my son while not allowing me to take him. While often having to work weekends myself it made having a relationship with them extremely difficult. I\u2019m pushing hard now, I\u2019ve already missed out on a large chunk of her childhood. I don\u2019t know my son at all. It gives me a headache just thinking about any of this. How do I build a relationship with this girl and possibly overcome brainwashing her mother has pushed on her? TL;dr today I tackle a mountain because my daughter needs to know I love her.<mutema>: Why didn't you get custody sorted out during the divorce? I wouldn't blame her if she looked at you sideways to be honest and 3 years is a bloody long time. She'll be a different person from when she was 6. Get your shit together and get something in place so that you can spend time with your kids. Whatever is going on between you and your ex should not affect the children in the way it is. If you must go through the courts then do so, but if you show up saying you ain't seen the kids in such a long time, even the courts could look at you sideways. <Needhardadvice117>: The custody was sorted out. She just refused to meet at times and wouldn\u2019t drive to the half way point.<mutema>: Then you might need to hit up r/legaladvice to see what your options are in regards to enforcing the agreed set up and what repercussions your ex could face for not complying but you have to be committed and do what you are supposed to do. Document things so that you have to something to show to the courts and your kids. If you let it go another 3 years then everyone concerned could just see it as if you have up or weren't interested enough. Fight your children. <Needhardadvice117>: It wasn\u2019t like I just didn\u2019t care to go see them. In the three years I was away I lost my home. All vehicles broke down and became useless scrap. I was homeless and jobless for a period. It took a lot of work but I built myself back up and crawled out of that hole. I will for sure fight for my kids. I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t mean physically fight them\ud83d\ude02. That surely would not help. But I may swing by legal advice and make sure there\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve missed legally.<mutema>: Ye, knock them kids out. Kidding. The struggle is real and it's hard out there that's understandable. That you went through such trouble within those three years is a bit if vital information to miss out tho bro. I assumed you were living it up on a beach in the Seychelles instead of fighting for them kids. It sounds like you are in a better place or getting there. Hope things work out for you and your daughter. If you can, set up a date when you can go out there and see her as soon as possible and spend some quality time with her. For as much trouble there's been between you and your ex and however terrible she may think you are, there was once a point where she found you good enough to settle down and have kids with. Try and talk to her to put your differences aside. If you can't, then just be cordial with one another not for your sales but for your children. <Needhardadvice117>: I wish mate. She has some very deep seated issues. After the Better part of decade with her she seems to be a puppet to her mother. I have no doubt many nasty things have been said about me to my children. It who they are. I wouldn\u2019t blame you for thinking I was on a beach somewhere. I have an older child 15 here where I live whom I still have a very good relationship with. My family encouraged me to keep a strong relationship with him.

She\u2019s always been a calm, \u201cmake love not war\u201d kinda person and very kind to everyone. This is completely out of character and I\u2019m still not sure if she was trolling or not. Yesterday evening we were sitting in the car and she was talking to some guy from her internship. She sounded heated and they were clearly arguing over something. When she hung up she said that he was an asshole, a douchebag etc...then she started calling him a \u201cdirty ass Jew\u201d. I was shocked to say the least and didn\u2019t even know what to say, it came out of nowhere. She said that all Jews are \u201cextremely arrogant\u201d and that they disgust her. For the record, we never discussed our religious backgrounds. Neither of us are religious (she\u2019s Middle Eastern) so that\u2019s just not something we ever brought up. She continued saying that you can\u2019t trust Jews, that they\u2019re all \u201crats\u201d and that she\u2019d rather die than associate with someone \u201cso corrupt\u201d. I asked her if that\u2019s how she really feels and she said yes of course. I still haven\u2019t told her that I\u2019m Jewish, I\u2019m not even sure how she will react when I do tell her. Should I even bother? It sucks because she\u2019s an amazing girl and I\u2019m ridiculously attracted to her but had no clue she was like this.

Break it, you're better off finding someone else who actually likes you for you and won't hate you for your ethnic/religious background.<keyuh>: Although the existence of Israel has exacerbated the issue, hatred of Jews in the Middle East is something that has been going on long before Jews returned there.<AppropriateOkra>: &gt; long before Jews returned there. You should know Jews have been living there for thousands of years, and thousands of year longer than arabs or muslims ever existed. Not all Jews are white/european and half of Israeli Jews have middle eastern backgrounds[ because the middle east kicked 95% of their Jews out after Israel was re-created.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-marks-exodus-of-jews-from-arab-countries/)<keyuh>: I do know that, *but* there was still rampant antisemitism throughout most of those times. In a lot of middle Eastern countries Jews were second class citizens in every sense of the word.<AppropriateOkra>: sure but I don't see the relevance. I'm just saying \"Jews *returned*\" is mis;eading at best because Jews as a whole never left.<keyuh>: I think we're on the same page but going at it from different angles. By returned I simply meant in the sense of a nation, I am fully aware that Jews never left *fully*. My point was that even while there, they were still treated poorly in certain countries.<AppropriateOkra>: &gt;By returned I simply meant in the sense of a nation OK I understand. A lot of people on reddit don't know middle eastern Jews exist and/or like to push a false narrative that European Jewish CoLoNiZeRs colonized the middle east (Israel) so I just wanted to clarify that Jews have always been there. &gt;My point was that even while there, they were still treated poorly in certain countries. definitely<neurotchick>: Yeah Jews have been in the Middle East longer than Muslims have. Doesn\u2019t mean Israel isn\u2019t a disgusting and horrifying country that should not exist.<AppropriateOkra>: &gt;Doesn\u2019t mean Israel isn\u2019t a disgusting and horrifying country that should not exist. No it doesn't mean that, *but* Israel definitely isn't. You're thinking of their neighbors who ethnically cleansed their Jews, violently kill their own people, have Islamic dictatorships, oppress their LGBT population and other minorities, etc. You know, the countries you most likely turn a blind eye to.<neurotchick>: I do sometimes wonder why progress regarding the occupation of Palestine is so slow. Then I speak to people who are as horrifyingly ignorant as you, and it makes sense. But progress is happening, slowly but surely, mostly by young people with no place in their heart for war. I imagine things will change very quickly once your generation dies off. I can\u2019t wait for that day. Until then, suck on some pork sausages.<AppropriateOkra>: Aww, the anti-semite is upset that I didn't drink the same kool-aid. Things will get better for you if you just stick with the therapy.<neurotchick>: Anti-semite? Where did you get that from? Anti-zionism isnt the same as anti-semitism.<AppropriateOkra>: Your irrational hatred of Israel paired with this little comment made it clear &gt; pork sausages.

Help?<EDIT1>: I AM (25M). Terribly sorry for the confusion on the title. New here and I realise I can't edit post titles. Well shit. <EDIT2>: UPDATE. I called her up in the afternoon. Here's the link to the conversation over phone - <https>://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bf50cr/update_i_25m_not_f_went_out_to_the_beach_with_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share Long one. I am new here, and I have been suggested by my friends to ask the good people of Reddit to provide their opinions. PLEASE read through this because I really need your help here. So, I have been seeing this girl (26F) for the last one month, and we have been hanging out at different places and having great conversations. Since today (Good Friday) happens to be a holiday, we went out last evening to a book fair, then had dinner at a pub and chilled out at the beach till almost 4:45 in the morning. We had amazing conversations all throughout this time and she took the lead on quite a few occasions to ask really thoughtful questions that pushed me to think further, and I am a sucker for conversations that demand usage of my intellect. Now, the original plan was to see the sunrise at the beach, have breakfast and go back to our respective homes. She said she was feeling a little uncomfortable coming over, and I respect that - unless I hear a yes, I assume it's a no. Safety and consent are paramount. However, at the pub, earlier last night, she lost a bet and asked me for a dare. I suck at doing things when I'm placed on a spot, so I came up with a silly dare that she herself said was too easy. So I amped up the challenge (while expecting fully well to hear her say no) by saying that the loser has to visit the winner's place. To my surprise, she agreed. I still thought that, by the time it's morning and we have breakfast at the beach, she will change her mind at we'll go back to our place as usual. But that is not what happened. We left the beach around 4:45 AM and came back to my place. My flatmates weren't home and I was surprised to see that. We watched comedy clips and music videos on YouTube, looked at each other's personality test results (she's INFJ and I'm ENFJ). One thing led to another and we were kissing and making out in my room. We started undressing each other when she said that it's her first time (having sex). That threw me off a bit and I could only muster an \"okay\", which I followed up with, \"We will take it slow, but if at any time you're uncomfortable with any of this, we stop.\" She was too tight down there and her legs were shaking from anxiety, which is when I decided to stop and pull out (didn't go in much in the first place). We cuddled and talked for a bit. Then made out a little more, cuddled and just lay there in bed to rest, after not sleeping for a whole night. She said that I was really good in bed and that she's sorry for being a mood spoiler - the latter wasn't true for me and we were discussing how she would go back home soon after. Called a cab for her so she could leave, and she was telling me (as we waited for the cab to arrive) that she would talk about this with her work team so they know we're 'together' now. I'm like, \"If you think that's necessary for you, go ahead.\" I come back to sleep. After a couple hours, I wake up to a message that says, \"Hey, I have a feeling (and I think I am right) that last night - the plan to go to your place, which was empty (and I think you\u2019d known that), the conversation - was manipulated. And it was overwhelming because you seemed to know exactly what you were doing and to what extent, which purged negative feelings instead of positive which I think should be the case when it comes to these things. I am sorry if I led you on to this, it was not intentional. I know you will understand when I say I don\u2019t want to continue this in any way. Take care of yourself.\" Now I had no clue my flatmates wouldn't come and I don't share the kind of relationship with them where they tell me where they're going or if they're coming back. And at no point did I force her to come to my place or be physical either. Also, I kept making jokes about how surprising it is that she's actually coming to my place (when we were coming back) because I was genuinely surprised on one hand and I also wanted to break the discomfort in her mind if there was any. I understand that a lot of this would have felt really fast for her, since it's her first time, and I see that she's coming from an emotionally turbulent state that I saw on her face when we were at my place. I have dropped a message apologizing nonetheless, adding that there wasn't any manipulation involved at all - and that it is understandable where she is coming from, but it would be best to talk about this with me instead of coming to a conclusion by looking at things from a particular lens. What do you guys suggest I do here?<walkingceberus>: I wonder if alcohol is the factor here. If she was really drunk, she could easily feel you took a kind of advantage of the situation. And given that you were drinking, I think this is it.<karmapolice042>: Hey, great point here. So we were chilling at the beach when we were still drunk (mildly, both of us, and I asked) and stayed there for almost 5 hours and then took a train back to my place that was another 1 hour. We were not under the influence of alcohol at all. I know because I asked if she was drunk, back in the beach itself right before leaving and she said that the effects had worn off. <EDIT>: We had one beer (the smallest glass) and 330ml of Long Island Ice Tea. That's it, if anybody is wondering.<walkingceberus>: Ok. Well my take on this is filling in some gaps, because as someone else said, we only have your version here. You say she was disoriented. You say she shook with anxiety. I'd say it must have been obvious to you earlier than when you had sex with her that she was uncomfortable and anxious. If she was obviously vulnerable and you persisted, she's going to feel used.<karmapolice042>: Thanks again for this perspective. It makes sense to try and see it from her lens, which I have been constantly trying. I am waiting for her to wake up, read the messages and reply. While we were having sex, I repeatedly mentioned that the moment she feels uncomfortable, we stop. And I did. <EDIT>: Also, I stopped the moment she was shaking. IMMEDIATELY. Nada. She kept apologizing for being a spoilsport and I was cuddling and reassuring her that it's fine and that she needs to be comfortable too and that's all that matters.<walkingceberus>: Perhaps - but if, as it sounds to me, you were very aware that she was uncomfortable, it should never have happened. Yes she's an adult, but we each have a duty of care to one another. I think you prioritised your desire to have sex over any niggling feelings you had that she didn't really want to, and the asking her those questions was a salve to your conscience, rather than a genuine effort to ensure her welfare. I also suspect that you are not really interested in her perspective - I think you are more interested in smoothing this over. You really need to look hard at yourself here, imo.<Alec_Ich>: This guy literally said \"if at any point you're uncomfortable we will stop\". What the fuck more did he need to do. Stop trying to blame this guy when it was just two consenting adults having sex<walkingceberus>: She was tembling with fear ffs.<Alec_Ich>: Being nervous for your first time having sex isn't uncommon (maybe one day you can experience this too). If she was really \"trembling with fear\" she could have asked him to stop.<walkingceberus>: Not if she was afraid. My legs have only trembled with fear twice in my life, and once was due to rape. I am not saying he raped her - I don't believe from this that he did. But do I think he took advantage? Yes.<SlowlyDying->: You just said you were raped that\u2019s terrible and I feel for you but do you not think your own experience is clouding your \u201cadvice\u201d here? It takes two to tango and blaming this all on him takes away any agency she has during this.<walkingceberus>: I think everyone has read that and automatically dismissed anything I have to say. Which isn't healthy or in the spirit of things. Yes, I was - 15 years ago. This is not about that.<SlowlyDying->: No, it was read and notes and only brought up when in your string of comments you kept projecting on to OP and that little detail is the root of the projection. Again all the empathy for what happened but it\u2019s not right to project that onto a person you don\u2019t even know. Hope your understanding where I\u2019m coming from<walkingceberus>: I do but I think if you read all my responses to him you'd see that, as I said in one comment to him, I was erring on the side of caution. I acknowledged that I cannot know definitively. And that it's a grey area and she shoulders some responsibility<risquealt>: You cannot know definitively, but you are still assuming that her events are true by even accusing him of being manipulative. Erring on the side of caution is not still tarring and feathering but with a pinch of restraint. You are totally projecting in taking a biased perspective based on your own experiences, and painting the OP based on how you imagine it went.<walkingceberus>: But you are going completely the other way. So how are you and I different.<risquealt>: I infer information from the story, and it's adding up. You are inferring information not from the story, and reaching a conclusion that can't be supported. [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/comments/bexqy2/i\\_25f\\_went\\_out\\_to\\_the\\_beach\\_with\\_a\\_friend\\_26f\\_won/el9bkhr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bexqy2/i_25f_went_out_to_the_beach_with_a_friend_26f_won/el9bkhr/) He said that he stopped as soon as she was shaking. He took the cues that you said that he missed. Technically, she never said no, but he went above and beyond in trying to detect that she was uncomfortable. If she didn't want sex, she should have said no earlier, and stuck to it. Not say yes, and go along with it, assuming that someone will jump in and read her mind. Then decide that the scenario that she agreed to was a little TOO perfect, and thus the entire thing was orchestrated by him, so she doesn't have to reconcile her morals, which is at the heart of the whole issue. This is a way for her to back out of all responsibility. &amp;#x200B; I get it, she can change her mind, and feel pressured in the moment to continue. That's not his fault that she gave expectations, and felt compelled to uphold them, because the pressure wasn't there when she agreed to the dare. They called it off, and talked it out. That's a no harm, no foul, not a crime.<walkingceberus>: I don't agree. You are not trying to imagine how this actually played out - you are basically defending yourself in this situation instead.<risquealt>: You can feel free to disagree, I am imagining how it played out. I am not imagining how you think it played out. I'd argue that you are defending yourself as well - from her perspective.<karmapolice042>: So I spoke with her over the phone.

Those friendships have greatly matured and those events aren't ever discussed anymore. It's in the past for all parties involved. As far as our friendships go, it's as if it never even happened. When I was in my early 20s I didn't see sex as something that was romantic or exclusive to partners in a relationship. It was an act that had no meaning whatsoever, especially between people not in relationships. I never dreamed that those decisions I made would impact my future marriage. These sexual acts occurred because it was available and it was only experimentation. I came out of it knowing that I was completely straight. When I met my wife I didn't tell her about this, because I was afraid of her reaction. I also didn't want her to leave me over this when we were still dating. This snowballed into what it is now and years had passed. I thought it would be best for her to know about the experimentation because I felt bad for the lie. She is very hurt by this, especially since they were also at our wedding and they're still our friends. She says it's something we could resolve but we don't know how to go about it. How do we get past this lie? How big is this obstacle in terms of marriage?<cowsuke>: Jesus fucking christ. she's hurt because people you had sex with once or twice were at your wedding? and you both grew as people and remained friends? what the fuck is wrong with your wife? you did nothing wrong. you are doing nothing wrong. your sexual life before entering into a relationship with your wife is none of her concern. you are not cheating on her. so you need to ask her why this bothers her. her feelings are valid, but punishing you or making you feel like you did anything wrong is not valid. this is a \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" situation<Needadvice3334>: It's not exactly what I did before we got together, it's the lie involved. She has asked me a few times before if I still have any contact with anyone I've had sex with before we met. I said no. She definitely isn't punishing me. She's just hurt, which I understand.<cowsuke>: ohhh. I see now that it's about lying previously. sorry for missing that. I suppose all you can do is explain your reason for lying, own up to the fact that lying was wrong, and agree not to lie in the future. the ball is in her court to decide if she wants to stay married to someone who lies to her.<Needadvice3334>: I don't lie to her. This was one thing and we're going to work through it. With the exception of this, we have a great marriage. We're definitely best friends.", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 0.8}

So my bf and I got into a full on brawl a while ago. He gave me a black eye, choked me, threw my car keys and cellphone down the hill to where they were unretrievable and then pretty much locked me in his house. I was yelling and screaming for the neighbors to hear and hopefully call the cops, but nobody came. This was all terrifying and traumatic, I had never been in a situation like this before. I didn't know what to do. The worst part was that I was pregnant and mid-fight I had this overwhelming feeling that I was going to lose the baby-which I did. During the fight I had also made the absolute decision not to have a baby with this man, so I'm kind of OK with how it happened (naturally vs medically induced). Because I didn't have my keys and my phone, I couldn't even leave, and he lives in the middle of nowhere so I had no other option than to just sit crying on the couch. He calmed down after about an hour of fighting/ yelling in my face and threatening me if I moved. Of course when he calmed down he tried to apologize, but he knew I wasn't going to hear it. I had to stay the night, because it was dark and in the morning I woke up and scoured the hill for my keys. I left as soon as I got them. All this being said he is borderline, has anger issues (obviously) and is an addict. I told my dad about everything that happened and he obviously isn't allowed anywhere near my house anymore. Ive told him that I haven't forgiven him and we broke up, BUT I still talk to him. I feel bad for him for some reason because he's really going through it. Is this a common thing to feel? and can someone give me advice on maybe how to cut it off completely? because every time I talk to him it just gives me a headache and I dont think were ever going to be able to go back to how things were when times were good.Were both hanging on to that idea. I've been trying because I am really attracted to him and he could be a GREAT person and S/O, he just has way too much he needs to work on. <awko_pando>: Cut this man out of your life. Please. If he's okay with laying hands on you once, there's a huge chance he'll do it again. You are putting yourself in so much danger by not removing him from your life. <_cerealism>: thats what my dad said. especially with me being pregnant. and he wanted a kid too, I didn't really. and he still put hands on me. He is dangerous and thats why ive been drawing it out...because I don't want him to fly off the rails. Im trying to figure out the easiest softest way to do this...but if I can't figure it out soon im just going to go the blunt route and tell him I can't talk to him anymore, block him, and essentially ghost him. <awko_pando>: Get a restraining order. I understand that you don't want him to totally freak out but drawing it out is just as dangerous. Make sure you're staying with people that won't let him near you. But for the love of God, get him out of your life as soon as possible <_cerealism>: oh a restraining order. I completely forgot those existed. Thats a good idea, thank you. I live at my parents, and they know whatsup, but he does know where I live, obviously. He's a complete wild card so anything can happen at anytime. which is scary. But I'll definitely try and be blunt about us not talking anymore at all, and if he still won't leave me alone ill get the restraining order as a last ditch effort. <awko_pando>: I would honestly suggest getting one regardless. A restraining order will ensure that there are legal repercussions should he try anything. I would strongly recommend that when you're filing for one mentioning that you're very concerned for your own safety along with your family's, the local police department may be able to provide some protection for you when you break the news. <_cerealism>: good to know. thank you so much for all this information. wish me luck &lt;3", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 2.2857142857}

You might have overreacted on the body count. 16 nowadays is not considered a lot by most - I would think it's too much, but others won't. It would be a minus point in a rosy picture. However he did two things wrong for me: - compare someone else favourably to you : even if his ex was more open about kinks that is information you neverrrrrr reveal period. Don't talk to people about the lists you make in you head. It kills your self-esteem to hear someone is better than you in any sort of way in the sack. I think it's normal you felt uncomfortable about sex after that. - react negatively when you said you didn't feel like it anymore. Instead of trying to get to the bottom he accused you of doing this to spite him. You don't owe the dude sex. Don't want to, don't do it. If you think your partner withholds sex as punishment, you're going to have a bad time.

That if I was open about someone being better or someone doing something he doesn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t care if I talked about it with him.<crosswalk_zebra>: Until you mention that you had an ex with a massive penis that made you cum instantly lol. That's bulllshit. I guarantee you he has little pieces of ego that are sore as well on which you should not tread. The 13 to 16 might have to do with shame, or he simply forgot a few people because it's not that important to him. Regardless, it is to you.

When I showed my acceptance letter to my parents they were so, so, so proud and happy. My family is poor, to say the least. Neither of my parents went to college. They\u2019ve sacrificed A LOT to ensure that I didn\u2019t need to work during high school so I could focus on studying. They told me that I should go to the Ivy. But here is where it gets complicated. Mom got sick last month and Dad had to take on additional shifts at work to offset the loss of her paycheck. I was also accepted into a state university in my city, and I\u2019m strongly considering going there instead because then I can work part-time and help take care of Mom. Guys what do I do?

I know Harvard does this. If they didn\u2019t they\u2019d only have incredibly wealthy people &amp; Ivy Leagues already have a huge slant towards that and realized it was an issue.

So back in December, my ex-girlfriend broke up with me. It was a very brutal breakup, considering it was my first relationship, and it has taken me a very long time to get over her. I'll start with a little backstory of our relationship. Her and I both lived in the same house on a very small college campus last semester. She had recently just broken up with her boyfriend at the beginning of the year and a few weeks later, her and I started dating. Right off the bat, things were not very good. To sum up some of the things that she did during the relationship: She cut our first date short so she could go get drunk, would flirt with other guys in order to get weed, would insult me and then pass it off like it was a joke, constantly flirted with multiple guys over text, never prioritized me, tried to pressure me into having sex earlier than I wanted, potentially cheated on me, and just in general did not treat me well at all. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, the dust has settled and I have had no contact with her since the day we have broken up. I looked at my own flaws throughout the relationship and began fixing what I needed to fix. I started by building up my self-confidence by going to the gym and meeting new friends. Despite not making direct contact with my ex, about a month or two ago, she spread this rumor that I called her a whore when I never did. She even got her friend to harass me over text message. On top of this, she also made out with my past roommate, two other guys, and had sex with a guy all in one night. Over the past few weeks, I noticed that she seems to have turned a corner. I see her around campus with some of the people from the house and she seems fine now. Also, some of the guys that I have kept in contact with at the house don't seem to have a problem with her anymore. &amp;#x200B; I really liked this girl and wish that things could work out between her and I. I have kept in contact with some of the people who also stayed at the house and one of them said that she is still just the way she is, constantly parties and stuff like that. I know it sounds crazy, but I want to make amends with her and try to start things fresh. It hurts to hear about all the partying and hooking up that she does and makes me feel as if I should start doing that to get her attention. What should I do? Please help me.<MundaneTension>: \u201cMakes me feel like I should start doing that to get her attention\u201d. Yes, hookup with other girls and focus on your studies. High value men are ambitious and focused on their pursuits I.e. school. High value men also have many options with women and have an abundance mentality they aren\u2019t afraid of their gf\u2019s leaving because they know they can easily find another. You need to be high value and I can tell from your post you were too nice with this girl which is why she walked all over you. Don\u2019t be a \u201cnice guy\u201d be assertive in a loving but dominant way with women about your wants needs.<elderchaos2324>: Do you think if I acted more assertive she would have done anything differently? I don't think that's the case. Still wouldn't have changed the behavior she had during our relationship that wasn't directed toward me.<MundaneTension>: \u201cRight off the bat she cut our date short to drink\u201d getting upset over this is needy your attitude should have been \u201cno problem I have other things to do as well\u201d \u201cShe would flirt with other guys to get weed\u201d Getting jealous shows insecurity which is extremely unattractive. Have the confidence not to be threatened by other men. \u201cTried to pressure me into having sex before I was ready\u201d This one does not even compute with me, like you didn\u2019t wanna fuck her right off the bat?<elderchaos2324>: 1. I never mentioned anything to her after she cut our date short. 2. She was secretly flirting with guys to get weed, I found out about it after the fact, so I wasn't really insecure. 3. Yeah, I'm a virgin so she said, \"I completely understand and we'll take it slow.\" Meanwhile, she would still attempt to push me in that direction and would get upset if I was nervous. Also it's not like I didn't want to have sex with her. So all three of your points make no sense to me. How exactly are her problems a sense of my insecurity? I agree that I am insecure, but isn't she giving me valid reasons to be if she pulls shit like that? I don't know man, maybe you're just not really understanding it<MundaneTension>: I don\u2019t think you get what I\u2019m saying. She disrespects you because she thinks you are weak and her attraction is low. There has to be a reason for this and I\u2019d guess you are projecting insecurity, maybe I\u2019m wrong. Regardless If you wanna know how to get her back it\u2019s by letting her come to you. Making positive changes to your appearance and actively having sex with other hot women is the best way to accomplish this. That\u2019s what your asking right?<elderchaos2324>: Yeah, I get what you are saying. I understand that she walked all over me, but I knew her enough before we started dating (as well as heard enough about her after we broke up) to realize that her flaws go deeper than just me being insecure. What I was trying to ask was that I was thinking of restablishing contact with her and was wondering if it was a good idea despite what happened before and based off of what others have told me about her.<MundaneTension>: If you reach out to her you are continuing to show her that you need her and are more invested in her than she is you. Improving yourself, seeing other women, &amp; Letting her come to you is the strongest course of action you can take. You need to start taking the strongest course of action with women. I\u2019m not attacking you just trying to help.<elderchaos2324>: No I completely understand. But how else can I even reattract her attention? I've been going to the gym and improving myself for months on end and she won't even come up to me at all.<MundaneTension>: You didn\u2019t say how long y\u2019all dated but if you had a meaningful relationship of some time she will come back on her on accord could be days, could be months, could me years I\u2019ve seen it all. You could speed things up by seeing other girls &amp; maybe posting to your social media if she\u2019s still into you this may get some attraction points for you. If you wanna reach out go ahead she may take you back but she\u2019ll definitely have the upperhand on you and her \u201ctoxic\u201d behavior will likely continue.<elderchaos2324>: Ok sounds good. I have a question for you. Do you believe that her behavior is toxic? The only reason I believe that she is a toxic person is not only because she acted like this while we were dating, but also beforehand and afterwards. I know, I made a mistake in dating someone who acted bad beforehand, but what do you think.<MundaneTension>: I hesitate to classify anyone as toxic. Ppl are just ppl who sometimes make mistakes. I don\u2019t think your ex is bad from what you\u2019ve written it just sounds like your both inexperienced when it comes to relationships. Your 19 &amp; only been with her if I were you I\u2019d start seeing other women &amp; buildup my sexual experience with other women &amp; from now on when dealing with women ask yourself what the strongest course of action you can take is and do it.<elderchaos2324>: So you don't think flirting with other guys while in a relationship, treating me like garbage for three months, potentially cheating on me, on top of everything else isn't bad? Is that a joke or something? Look I understand people make mistakes, but what about making the same consistent mistakes? I've talked to plenty of other people who wholeheartedly agree that she is toxic.<MundaneTension>: I think that she was flirting with other guys because you were not treating her the right way which is understandable since your young and this is your first relationship.<elderchaos2324>: Man I wish I could explain the whole relationship, but I cant. You can believe me if you want to or not, but I was extremely nice to my ex, the only problem I had was insecurity issues. I treated her very well, always complimented her, took her out on dates, etc. She even told me she felt like she was living in a movie because her previous boyfriend never did anything nice for her! Her last boyfriend sucked!! I think that's where the disconnect is between you and I.<MundaneTension>: \u201c I was extremely nice to my ex, I had insecurity issues. I treated her well, took her on dates, etc. she even told me she felt like she was living in a movie because her previous boyfriend never did anything nice for her\u201d This is exactly what I mean! You were too nice to her and put her on a pedestal which gave her the impression she was better than you which is why she treated you like trash, In real life you do not want to emulate toxic movies like \u201cHitch\u201d in real life you want to emulate ppl like James Bond with women.", "num_messages": 16, "avg_score": 1.0}

He is the type most people would rather avoid. His drinking and smoking pot are a major problem imo. I'm sure you're not the only one suffering. His children are taking it the hardest. Im truly sorry for them imo his smooth talks doesn't polish his other flaws. I understand that no one is perfect but honestly speaking, this guy doesn't seem good tome at all but thats just my opinion and youre here for an advice on how to patch things up and not to end it all. On top of all his addiction problems, he's a narcissist which isnt something to just ignore. Even if his addiction problems go away, him being narcissist might bite you but i hope it doesnt If you have talked about this before, then you should probably bring it up again. You should push him to the edge so he has to decide what to drop and what to keep. You're at the losing end here... you have to face the consequences and probably even regret all these years. You are the one who is in pain due to his actions... he prob doesnt even care. Your first priority should be to stop him from smoking and drinking. If you can get your hands on his weed and alcohol then you should confiscate them all and throw them in the trash. He's to choose between you and his addictions. I can understand him not to want to work hard but what does he want to live on ESP if you move in with him. I can understand him not wanting to lend money which will most defiantly be spent on more weed or alcohol. He's just worried if he can buy enough weed or alcohol for tomorrow The fact that the only thing driving your relationship rn is sex is pretty sad and is a red flag imo and ontop of that he doesnt appreciate you for your love and efforts. You should resist your urge to have sex for a while. When his lust kicks up, he'll turn to you. That's the best time for you to strike. I understand you dont to break up with him even after all these poor qualities of him but is it alright for you to stay in this relationship?Ask yourself if you'd feel okay thinking about all this 10 years from now. You dont know maybe theres someone out there who is far better that you deserve I'd like to add that his situation rn is effecting you more than it does to him. Everyone has their own world they want to keep clean and beautiful. You arent responsible if his world is falling [apart. **YOU**](https://apart.YOU) **ARENT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HE DOES** <TLDR>: force him to choose between you and his addiction. That is the first step to solve all this problems<road_kill9>: Damn it took me an hour to write this. But its time well spent. Sometimes people want a third party to just tell them straight to break up. Most people think that option doesnt exist or its sad or maybe worry about what the other side would go through. What he goes through isnt your fault. Its all his fault for making mistakes. You are responsible to take care of your world. Cause who will be taking care of it if you are trying to fix others'.

So. Problem #1: your would-be girl is a addict. That's where that is. Either she will seek help, the court will force her to get help (should you decide to call CPS on her to try to help those kids into a possibly better environment), or she'll find her death at the bottom of a pill bottle. And you can't make her seek help. She has to seek it on her own. Problem #2: this is an abusive relationship. She is your abuser. This is not safe for you and is sure as shit not safe for the kids. Problem #3: you are enabling her. By staying, you are telling her that it's okay to treat people like this. It's okay to treat herself like this. Bottom line is she needs that come-to-Jesus moment and she hasn't had it yet. Nor is it guaranteed to happen at all. My suggestion: walk away. That's not a healthy relationship. She's not a healthy person. You are trying to get your life on track after being branded a sex offender. Dating her is not how to do that. <Oncemore89>: I know she is an addict, and she knows it as well. We\u2019ve had long discussions about it, and it really all boils down to her saying that she will better herself and change her life, but it has to be on her time. And I understand that, and there\u2019s nothing I can do to help the situation other than to be there for her and to provide support mentally. The drugs aside, she is a great mother. I\u2019m not holding her up on a pedestal, but she goes to great lengths for her children and does try to be as active and involved in their life the best she can. It\u2019s just her demons sink their talons deeper and deeper into her at times, and that\u2019s when everything is at it\u2019s worst. Your third point has been the most impactful sentence I\u2019ve thought about in a minute. I\u2019ve mulled it over in my head a million times, and I agree. It\u2019s just, so many people have given up on her, and life hasn\u2019t been kind to her as well. When I\u2019ve told her I will still be here to pick her up and dust her off, I want to remain true to that. But I just don\u2019t want to be taken advantage of in that sense. I\u2019m trying to do what I can to distance myself from her. But fuck, even after everything good and bad. She was not only the person i am in love with, but also my best friend. She\u2019s almost like my addiction.<lisa_lili>: A) when she says she'll get better on her own time, she's really saying that she'll do it later. Which is addict speak for \"I don't want to\". I know. I'm fluent. I've literally said that before. B) You can not simply say \"drugs aside\". That's like pretending that the drugs aren't a problem. They are a problem. Those children will grow up remembering what it was like to have an addict as a mother. A mother who was so busy chasing her own high that she's overdone it a couple times. What if she died? Where would her kids be then? Now, I don't know her or her parenting style but if she's more concerned about her high than her 4 year old, I think something is wrong. C) You, sir, have a savior complex. Welcome to the club. We have cake and coffee on Wednesdays. Lol. No, but seriously. You want to save her. But you can't. She has to save herself. You are addicted to the idea of being her savior. But you aren't saving her. She's still using. She's still abusing you. She's still going down a path that doesn't end well for anyone involved. Plus, that wanting to stay true to her no matter what she does business? It's martyrdom. In my experience, this practice works never. You want to be the one to help her but in the end, all you end up being is a doormat she can use to get her next fix or make sure her kids are taken care of. So she doesn't have to take responsibility. D) when you refer to someone as your addiction, you become a part of the problem. I had a person as an addiction once. I had to cut her out, cold turkey, in order to regain some semblance of independence back in my life. One of my better decisions. I was able to focus on myself, which I desperately needed. I'm just saying...It's a dangerous road, enabling an addict. I'd walk away.", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 1.0}

So I\u2019ve become pretty close with all of their wives. We have parties and everything together and all of our kids are like cousins. The wives are really sweet and we talk and carpool and baby sit for each other if we need. So one of the girls texted me that she found out there\u2019s apparently this apartment all the guys split up the rent for and go there whenever to get away from their wives and lie about going on work trips. I know that sounds really fucking bad but there is no way she\u2019s lying, she\u2019s not like that. I know she\u2019s telling the truth. And he does go on work trips and all that pretty frequently. But I always thought he was actually going for work. I feel so fucking dumb and confused and I just wanna call him up but I know I have to be smarter than that. He\u2019s on a trip or whatever right now and I don\u2019t wanna text him where he can take a couple hours to come up with an answer, I need to confront him in person This has me so fucked up, I can\u2019t even explain the emotions I\u2019m going through right now. I have no fucking idea what to do. I am a house wife and I don\u2019t have anything to do with the finances. He has a good paying job and I have a credit card and whatever I want, he\u2019ll tell me if we can afford it or not and sometimes we talk about our savings but we really don\u2019t have money problems so there\u2019s no reason to talk about it in depth like that. So I had no idea about him paying for this apartment. And I know they\u2019re not doing anything innocent there. The most innocent thing they\u2019re probably doing is some gambling and lying about leaving for work and just relaxing together. Worst thing is having affairs. Cheating once and making a mistake, I can deal with. I know they bring girls there, there would be no other reason to rent out a fucking apartment just to hang out. I feel so confused and nasty and I don\u2019t know what to do or how to bring it up. And if it\u2019s true, what the fuck am I gonna do??? I didnt even finish my bachelors, we met when I was 18 and then we got married and I dropped out when I was pregnant. And we have two children, our daughter is 6 and the baby is 2. I am trying to think of some innocent explanation, that she made a mistake or something I have no idea but I don\u2019t know what to think. My hands are shaking and I feel this anxiety in my chest like I\u2019m gonna have a heart attack or throw up and I couldn\u2019t sleep last night and this is too much for me to handle And I don\u2019t know how to ask him. I am thinking of slyly bringing it up but I\u2019m not slick enough for that, when he comes home on Monday I know I\u2019m just gonna start crying. And if it\u2019s not true, accusing him straight up is gonna be so bad and he\u2019s gonna feel like shit that I don\u2019t trust him or something How do I ask him??? <CrownRoyal_>: I'm not going to jump to worst case here, because while it is a possibility, it's not a guarantee and even if some are cheating, it doesn't mean he is. Now what I'm about to say isn't me defending his actions, even if there is no infidelity, it is immature and breaches your trust..... Frankly, a cheap apartment with buddies when you have little kids makes sense to me. After a week of staying with my brother and his 2 &amp; 6 year old, I needed a vacation. A place (I imagine a man cave) to hide out for a few days to get away from the kids, and just watch TV, have a few drinks, play some video games.... etc could be really nice. <grimreapersdtr>: Most women need vacation from toddlers, but never ever get them. Men father children also, so why do they get the luxury of vacations from fatherhood and marriage? <CrownRoyal_>: Where did I suggest it's okay or deserved? I'm just saying why I think they could have done it, without it being for cheating like most people are suggesting. That's all. It's absolutely wrong to lie to your spouse, it's completely selfish to put yourself above them and I think anyone doing so is a neglectful parent and/or spouse. <grimreapersdtr>: You said having a hidey hole to shirk responsibilities \u201cmakes sense to you\u201d for a man to do. No, it does not make sense. <CrownRoyal_>: I think it makes sense for anyone to do, you are the one that made this about gender, not me. <grimreapersdtr>: No, it doesn\u2019t make sense. <CrownRoyal_>: If it's too complex for you to understand, that's a you problem. Because it's pretty fucking simple.<grimreapersdtr>: Don\u2019t insult my intelligence.<CrownRoyal_>: Perhaps you should show you have some intelligence then.<grimreapersdtr>: Hello? Did I name call you? It\u2019s against the sub rules to do that to another poster.<CrownRoyal_>: Not directly, but you sure have implied a great deal about me, including me being sexist. Which is extremely ironic after glancing at your post history.<grimreapersdtr>: I speak from experience. Meanwhile, endless posters will stick up for the guy regardless of how outrageous his behavior truly is. And much of the world is exactly the same, which is why OP needs to watch her back and be on her guard.<CrownRoyal_>: None of which I ever disagreed with, in fact I stated lying was wrong and immature. Then, even after I clarified what I meant you still made it about gender, which it never was. Maybe you should stop trying to read between the lines and interpreting things based on nothing but your own experience. Those guys are doing something horrible, yes. But you painting every man with the same brush because of your experience, is also pretty fucking horrible.<grimreapersdtr>: &gt;Frankly, a cheap apartment with buddies when you have little kids makes sense to me. \"Buddies\" is a term that implies men. My experience is based on the experiences of many others. Men with large incomes, mobile jobs, and SAH wives often pull cr@p like this, it's not a new phenomenon. They have no fear of their wives retaliating, because they know their wives have limited access to money. Sometimes they make the money accounts completely inaccessible. My father did it to my mother. Numerous other people I've known went through the same nightmare. Then there's the mistress and prostitutes, hotel rooms, or secret apartment on the side. It's so common that it's practically cliche.<CrownRoyal_>: And every woman I've dated has slept around, I guess that makes all women cheaters, right? But, that's the difference between you and I, I'm not stupid enough to paint everyone with the same brush.<grimreapersdtr>: I'm not stupid, nor am I painting everyone with the same brush. Or is it your default mode to name call women you disagree with? Perhaps if you weren't a hockey player, you wouldn't be dating groupies. That being said, I'm sure road mistresses and roadie girlfriends are A-OK when wifey is away.<CrownRoyal_>: Well for one I'm not a hockey player. I've never cheated on a significant other. I only call people stupid that show they are, and continually making assumptions about people is absolute stupidity. Maybe you should take a look in the mirror.<grimreapersdtr>: You are still name calling. That's nice. Perhaps if you didn't resort to that, your ex-girlfriends wouldn't have gotten fed up with you and cheated on you. You're assuming this guy is innocent, and that she is being hysterical on some level. If the tables were turned, would you say the same?<CrownRoyal_>: I never assumed anything. It's like you haven't read a word and just want to bitch and blame men for everything. And you wonder why I have the low opinion of you that I do.... But I'm done wasting my time on someone as ignorant and narrow minded as you.<grimreapersdtr>: You can't deal with not having the last word in an argument with a woman. You resort to name calling.

Gonna try to make this as short as possible, but it\u2019s hard to cap a 5 year relationship into a short blurb. Here it goes.... my bf (44) and I (37) have been together 5 years and living together for nearly 2. When we met, things could not have been more perfect. I had never experienced a love or relationship like what we had. Prior to us moving in together, he lost his job and could no longer pay his rent and other bills. He moved into the small place I shared with my 2 children (18&amp;10). We never discussed any kind of payment for this and he did not contribute. He found a job and we decided to get a larger place together. To give you a little background, I am a professional with a 4 year degree and work 2 high paying jobs. He doesn\u2019t have a profession, per se, and has always just gotten by. So, we move into a much more expensive place and again we do not discuss finances. I always got the impression that he was intimidated that I made so much more money than him so it was a hard subject to broach. I take full responsibility in this. An adult discussion covering any bills and splitting of those bills should have been had prior to us moving into this place. But they didn\u2019t and here we are. I have been paying 95% of all of the household bills. I am constantly stressed over money. This house we are in would be a breeze to afford if he contributed. I ask for help and don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck and quite honestly I make too much money for that to be happening. We fight constantly. For me, it always seems to wrap back around to this money issue. Not to completely throw him under the bus here. I have not always been the easiest person to live with. Up until very recently, I was suffering from crippling depression, my kids are not the most responsible (mostly due to lax parenting on my part), didn\u2019t have chores, and my partner and I share a very different idea of the definition of clean. However, we went to counseling for a short time. I quit because of my depression and not liking the counselor. But I have been doing much better with my depression after starting medication a few months ago. I\u2019ve also implemented a chore system for my kids and continue to make efforts to make the changes he would like to see in me and these changes are, quite frankly, changes I need to make for myself anyway. However, I am still paying all the household bills. When we would ugly fight before, I would tell him to get out. The house and all of the bills are in my name. He says it\u2019s because of this that he doesn\u2019t pay any bills. I know that he makes significantly less than I do. But does that negate him from helping? While we never had a discussion about bills, I never in a million years thought I would be paying for everything myself. We continue to fight and makeup. On this roller coaster for months. The problem I\u2019m having is that when we are not fighting, things couldn\u2019t be better. We have a great time. We share everything with each other. But when we fight it\u2019s ugly. He takes low blows and constantly goes after what I\u2019m most insecure about. Today after a particularly ugly fight, he was going away for the weekend with his buddy. Things got out of hand (not physically) but the cops were called. We both gave our sides of the story. I said I wanted him out permanently. The cops basically said I couldn\u2019t do that. I would have to go thru the eviction process. That takes a minimum of 21 days. I plan to go file those papers ASAP. My question is do I cut my losses or use this 3 weeks to try to salvage what we have? I was considering make a few more counseling sessions to see what happens. See where he\u2019s at. But in reality can a relationship survive such ugliness? With each fight becoming uglier and uglier I find it harder to trust what he says to me when we aren\u2019t fighting. Because it flips so easily for him like a switch. I\u2019m so confused. So hurt. Sorry for such a long post. Im open to any advice you all might have. Thanks. <wifey0987654>: Why would you want to work on it? Haven't you actually been working on it already and it has produced changes in you, but none in him? I mean, what in the world are you getting out of this relationship? Is he a good \"stepfather\" of some kind to your kids? He doesn't seem like a good partner to you. Does he do all the maintenance on cars and home? What is his contribution? Is it worth enough for you to quit fighting and accept his reality? &amp;#x200B; Also, I don't understand why you have to \"evict\" him when he never pays rent???<sooooooolost>: You bring up a lot of great points. He is pretty much the only father my little one has known. I severed my childrens\u2019 father\u2019s rights years ago. He used to do maintenance on the house and yard and cars, but has not done much of anything for months. He says because of how our relationship is going. The only reason I think that we could try to work on it is because of how happy we were prior to all of this. Wondering if we can find that again or it\u2019s just done. As for the eviction stuff, I thought I could just get him out and that would be that. Cops today told me that it doesn\u2019t matter whether his name is on anything or not. This has been his home for 2 years and we\u2019ve basically entered into a verbal agreement of this also being his home. I don\u2019t understand it all. But hoping the court can clear some of this up. <wifey0987654>: How are your kids going to feel if their only other male role model is out of their life for good? I don't know their ages or how they actually feel about him, but that is important. Although equally important is all the fighting all the time- that can't be good for anyone.

People cheat, it happens, it\u2019s just sex and for the most part physical. How many times does someone (outside of a relationship), hook up with someone and then never talk to them again. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s planned out with the intent to hurt someone, it\u2019s often spontaneous, especially for girls who have much more opportunities for this kind of thing, and it can definitely be a mistake. I\u2019ve cheated on people and also been cheated on, in both instances we were madly in love<hw0000>: I don't think you can compare \"being single and hookup \" and \" having a partner but hookup\". If you are single and you have needs sure you can hookup with no emotions. But when you have a partner, you hook up with them if you have needs. But hookup with someone else with no emotions and knowing it's wrong ? Doesnt make sense. Why pay the cost when there's no reason to?<OnSumGShit>: It\u2019s a mistake, it happens. I\u2019m not gonna rewrite my post again. People make all sorts of excuses for it Bc their ego wont let it go. If your gf cheats on you then begs for you back, like hello she obviously wants to be with you and knows she messed up. Not \u201cshe just wants a provider\u201d, those guys have been reading too much PUA bullshit or red pill.<willgo-waggins>: There is right and wrong on both counts. While I agree that just because something happens it\u2019s not the ending of the emotion for the primary person, I really think that if you want to choose to be in that kind of relationship (poly, swinger or what have you - I don\u2019t like labels) then it need to be something that both partners agree to not one person thinking you are exclusive and the other having a tilt whenever the mood strikes. I have know a huge number of very successful swinger relationships that are very tight close and living but they enjoy variety when it comes to their sex life. I don\u2019t know a lot of poly people so I am not as sure about that because I see a lot of third wheel type complaints with that group.<OnSumGShit>: I\u2019m not poly at all, but I could move past my partner cheating on me given the right circumstances. It\u2019s human nature, and it\u2019s extremely unlikely for someone to not stray from you ever. Something like my gf kissing someone would probably be a minor issue given it was a one off thing with some random guy at a club/concert she\u2019ll never see again etc. but then you have the guys who can\u2019t trust/believe their partner and think a kiss = sex because of \u201cThe Cheaters Script\u201d or some bullshit. I saw a guy on here recently who was upset and wanted to end it because his girlfriend had drunkenly kissed another *girl*. The typical Reddit choir chimed in and agreed it was \u201ccheating\u201d and told him to dump her ASAP. That one really blew my mind and I had a bit of a chuckle \ud83d\ude06<sandman7767>: I always love the argument \"it's human nature\" as if the point of civilizing to rise above our animal instincts is moot. Yes temptation is a very real thing, and many times the reason cheating happens in the moment. But acknowledging temptation, and removing yourself from it is an important part of being in a relationship, the key part that cheaters lack.<OnSumGShit>: The funny thing is that *is* our animal instinct.

I commute over to his city on the weekends and we\u2019re at a good rhythm and I love seeing him at the end of the week. Last week he asked me to stick around the house for an alarm installation, part of the install was a doorbell with a camera so I had to download an app that ties in to a camera. Which means that this week I was getting notifications when he was coming and leaving the house with video attached. Two things before I continue: (1) I love this man very man and he loves me but we\u2019d always agreed we weren\u2019t going to last forever and we take it Day by day. And (2) we used to go to bed at 8 routinely, and have only started going out in the last few months. He\u2019s normally a total homebody and doesn\u2019t have a social circle of any sort right now. Tuesday he didn\u2019t get home until 1:30 in the morning. For someone his age, and his personality type, I thought this was highly unusual. But I let it go, I know there\u2019s a local bar he\u2019s become fond of so it\u2019s not out of the question for him to have just lost track of time. But then it happened tonight. It\u2019s now 5AM where I live and he hasn\u2019t come home, the system is alarmed as away and he left at about 6:30PM yesterday. I don\u2019t know whether to be worried for his safety or start making some real exit plans. I could use a sanity check. How do I approach this conversation with him if he HAS been disappearing overnight? Is it even a discussion? TLDR newly installed house security system says boyfriend hasn\u2019t been home yet tonight.<sonicrack>: Call him to check up on him. Does he not know you get notifications when he's exiting or entering the house since he knows you downloaded the app?<23232347428>: I wasn\u2019t signed in before this weekend so it\u2019s possible it\u2019s slipped his mind that I\u2019d signed in. I\u2019d called around 10PM last night to chat and he didn\u2019t pick up. I texted around 3 or 4 too and he hasn\u2019t responded yet.<sonicrack>: Is that like him to not pick up the phone. If that happened to my gf I would be quite concerned but I also have a friend that it's more odd to pick up the phone than not to.<23232347428>: I just realized he\u2019d texted goodnight at midnight. Normally he wakes up in the middle of the night so I would have assumed he\u2019d texted me goodnight then, but at least he\u2019s... he must be okay because he\u2019s texted me while he was still \u201cout\u201d and while he was \u201cout\u201d way past when he\u2019d normally be so wherever he is... maybe he\u2019s okay.<sonicrack>: I'm not saying it's likely but it might be a possibility that for some reason you weren't notified when he came back. Anyway try to get some sleep and check what happened tomorrow. Also please let me know I'm invested Try not to worry to much :)<23232347428>: Thanks. No sleep happening now, on my way to a morning appointment! The phone gives me notifications but also shows when the system is alarmed for away or disarmed. The doorbell camera automatically records when the motion detector is activated. Again if this is a one off but Tuesday being way later than usual with no explanation is what\u2019s making me think there\u2019s something I\u2019m missing here about him.<sonicrack>: I hope you are used to functioning without much sleep and that nothing important is happening with him<23232347428>: Thanks friend.", "num_messages": 9, "avg_score": 3.3333333333}

Our companies were partners, so, I\u2019d see her at work events. I always thought she was pretty hot (so did everyone else I worked with), but, she had a boyfriend at the time when I met her. I find out through social media that they broke up. I knew that other men would ask her out, so, I didn\u2019t want to take any chances and totally went for it and asked her out. We\u2019ve been together ever since and she\u2019s just as I had always imagined. Her personality matches her looks. She\u2019s a great person, is loving, supportive, and it\u2019s safe to say that I\u2019m in love with her. We were out to dinner with friends last weekend and she and her best friend something that has been bothering all this week: <Friend>: At least you\u2019re done with the whole old, rich guy dating thing! <GF>: I know, right? It feels good to just be in a normal relationship. It got to me pretty bad. When we got home, I was honest and asked her about the convo her and her friend had. My GF didn\u2019t hesitate to be honest. Her most recent ex she was on-and-off with for almost four years (I knew this). During the time they first broke up, she had decided to \u201clive carefree\u201d and \u201cenjoy her youth\u201d and began dating rich, older men. Some of these men were even older than her dad. Yes, she was younger than some of these men\u2019s kids too. They were clients at her old job (she previously worked in luxury real estate). She was just trying to have fun. I thanked her for her honesty. Now, her most recent ex was actually a \u201cnormal\u201d guy. Around her age and had a decent job. So, it took me by surprise because I never even thought about her being with older men. While I do appreciate the honesty, it has been bothering me all week. I keep thinking that I dated a sugar baby. She can tell my mood has been down all week and has been asking if it\u2019s because of her dating history. I tell her \u201cno\u201d because I feel like I\u2019m overreacting and I need to get over it. Am I overreacting though? Anyone have advice? <TLDR>: My GF used to date rich, older men and it\u2019s bothering me.<middleagedlothario>: Sugar Babies are just paid escorts who gets gifts, trips, parties and such instead of just cash. So she was an escort sleeping with older guys for fun and a lavish lifestyle. Up to you if you find it acceptable.<SpeakInMyPms>: She didn't say she was a sugar baby, though. *He's* equating dating old rich dudes to being a sugar baby/escort.<Midnightproxxima>: I'd say most don't fuck old rich men simply because they'rr attracted to them. It happens but those relationships are usually more transactional.<SpeakInMyPms>: You'd be surprised by how many women are attracted to older men. Wealth and success are just the sprinkles which make it spark.<middleagedlothario>: Wealth and success are the attraction in most cases, others are daddy issues. You don\u2019t see young women chasing poor middle aged men.<SpeakInMyPms>: Maybe you don't lmao<middleagedlothario>: Why do you say that?<SpeakInMyPms>: Eh? What needs elaboration?<middleagedlothario>: Your comment. Maybe I don\u2019t what?<SpeakInMyPms>: &gt;You don\u2019t see young women chasing poor middle aged men. Maybe you don't see this.<middleagedlothario>: No I don\u2019t. I see young women chasing older successful wealthy men often. I\u2019m in my forties, single and well off. I can attract women under 25 all the time by displaying my wealth and success, but they always want something- trips, help with bills or college funds, gifts, etc. When I was using on-line sites I was swamped with young women until I changed my profile and because an average 40 year old guy without a lot of money- the drop off in interest was immense in that age group, however the interest by women over 30 jumped immensely. So in my experience, young girls equate older guys with money and a more lavish lifestyle to party with.<SpeakInMyPms>: Well obviously, on a dating site these qualities need to be amplified to compete with the hundreds to thousands of profiles in one area.

We are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator. About two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc. So off we got to the GP, who gives us a consult to a Rheumatologist. Come to find out, she has rheumatoid arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment. Fast forward to a month ago, when our North Texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed. She woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were HUGE, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages. And even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring. So, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring. So, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from Ireland and custom designed, and have words in Gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of \"repair\", and they were designed and made......17 years ago. She was absolutely GUTTED. I assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell, to her, it was. Begin Sherlock Holmes Mode. I googled until I couldn't google anymore. I was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age. I searched some more. I finally found his personal Facebook page, and I message him, and wait......and wait...... I finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her Da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago. I express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry. I go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc. She tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened. Fast forward a couple of weeks. I get a message on Facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler. She explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and MOLDS in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm. She sent pictures, and I confirmed that YES - THOSE ARE OUR RINGS! She said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address. I open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures. OF OUR RINGS. She went ahead and had her BROTHER, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge. I asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and I was allowed to keep my old one. She told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands. I asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive. Our \"New\" Wedding Bands will be here Thursday. Trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has NO IDEA any of this took place. \\*Edit - I rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her I was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed. The absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to NOT tell her as we tell each other EVERYTHING. So now I not only need to figure out HOW to do this, but NOT to spill the beans until then. (Our friends nicknamed us Mickey and Mallory as well as Marshall and Lilly from \"How I Met Your Mother\", because we literally tell each other everything) \\*Edit 2 - I thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where I actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (VA Nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so ALWAYS goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when I originally proposed, I waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....\"waited\".....am thinking of a repeat. \\*Edit 3 - And to those of you saying \"I\" am awesome, not in the slightest. SHE is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends. She is the reason I breathe, and supported all of us when I went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career. She is my hero. I wake up every day to earn her all over again. This was one small thing I was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why I have a heartbeat. And I don't give a good flying f\\* at a rolling donut if I seem sappy. If a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one. TL;DR Wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, I went Hardy Boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.

I am on a mobile phone writing this and this is my first ever post, so I apologise for any typos/confusion I may cause, thanks everyone So i recently met this girl through a female friend (known the girl now for nearly a month) and I think she's great, I'm conflicted with whether I should allow myself to like her but i feel she's... different. As I got to know her she reveals she has had alot of bad experiences with relationships with both male and female (so she is bi - this does not bother me at all) Fast forward to present day: I've gone clubbing with her a few times, we've kissed (only when drunk) held eachother while dancing, had a great time, met up multiple times and so on. Now a bit about me, I've had only one girlfriend and I'm personally looking for a serious relationship yet from what i see most guys don't, they just want to as you could say \"fuck and chuck\" which honestly disgusts me, id love nothing more than to have a girl i can love, cherish and be with and make happy. i personally am depressed and take medication for it, life in general is really tough for me and the more I get hurt looking for love, the worse it gets and I know being able to love and having a significant other would make me feel... complete and a reason to I guess keep going Enough about me; back on track. As I speak to this girl i discover she is like me, never goes out, speaks to hardly anyone (supposedly), she hasn't said she's depressed but from how she acts and from what she tells me it maybe a reality. I'm not sure if this matters but i think she's absolutely gorgeous and I'm tempted to really start trying to maybe make something from it... But here is where it gets weird. So i keep asking to hangout, meetup etc, eventually she agrees and comes to my house But I know she's very uncomfortable with this due to her past experiences so i take her to a nearby restaurant/pub from where I live. We walk up together and go there and it is just the 2 of us. Long story short it is going great, we keep ordering drinks and we talk and talk and talk and I'm having a great time and she is too... then she starts asking me sexual questions... What are your kinks? What is your favourite sex position? Then lowkey dirty talk starts, we make sexual jokes towards one another etc and it gets weirder from there. She asks me to sit next to her, i do... she then puts her phone in my face to reveal a literal naked picture of her entire ass... at this point I'm speechless and ofcourse turned on but im thinking to myself... What does she want? What is she trying to tell me? I try to be careful as I've recently started talking to this girl but as im thinking she asks me if I want to see more... i say \"It's up to you I wouldn't be complaining\" and then straight away I am shown a picture of her full frontal body which is her tits, stomach etc... at this point I'm just confused as to what's going on and without warning I'm shown a FINAL picture which was a literal picture of her naked vagina... What?!?! (This is my first time experiencing this situation) So we dirty talk and she keeps telling me how she's horny and related things... fast forward and we go out clubbing, get a little bit touchy feely but thats all, the next day she feels sick as she's drunk so much, i tell her how i feel sorry for her and that I wish I could cheer her up and make her feel better and that I'm there for her (because she also kept saying how she's super embarrassed about how drunk she had gotten) and then... she simply says \"I'm not sleeping with you\" and then ignores me for the entirety of the day... I could not believe she said this it hit me like a tonne of bricks... I haven't even told this girl i might LIKE her let alone wanting to have sex!! ! I got really upset with her and explained how I'm not like that and I want a relationship etc After she said this she did not reply for the rest of the day and the following day she just said how she was \"sorry\"... That's it. Help!? I have no idea what to do, this happened a few days ago and since then we've talked on the phone, messaged like normal and even dirty talked a tiny bit on text (insinuated by her, like with the nudes) The thing is she tells me she \"really appreciates what i say\" and how she is \"greatful for it\" it just sounds all weird like she's trying to friendzone me despite there being nothing to friendzone... I believe she's scared due to again her past experiences and doesn't want to risk anything to do with her feelings.... yet she also tells me how she hates talking on the phone yet the last time we did (lastnight) we spoke for over an hour and all she does is laugh and we talk so damn easily... she even mentioned this herself. It is important to point out how she will have really low moods, to a point where like today she said she \"didn't feel like talking\" and id have to leave her alone... or how she would always say how she doesn't get why i care about her and how nobody cares about her and how i dont know the \"real\" her as i tell her she's a good person and she disagrees... <RECAP>: started speaking to a girl, began to like her, she's very weird, unusual but not like most girls (or is she?) - met her, she then showed me her FULL nudes in person then told me she won't sleep with me the next day randomly for no reason (DESPITE me not even mentioning having sex with her, she doesn't even know I like her...) I don't know what I'm asking for from you guys, just some advice... any advice... thank you! If there is any questions or confusion I'll try to reply and respond as quick as i can<ALeaf_OnThe_Wind>: Dude she\u2019s a ho with serious issues. She likes the attention you giver her but she doesn\u2019t like you. She probably has a couple other guys she\u2019s doing the exact same thing to. My advice- ignore her back. Be aloof. Do not give her any attention to feed off. One of two things will happen 1. Your time with her ends and you are free of drama. 2. (Which is what I suspect will happen) she won\u2019t be able to handle being ignored and try even harder to get your attention. Play your cards right and you can get her to fuck you. Boom. Good luck dude<SamEntity>: I get what you mean, its a really tricky game, I'll see how it goes, I'm supposed to be going out with her this weekend so hopefully something comes of it<ALeaf_OnThe_Wind>: Don\u2019t hang out with her this weekend. Say something came up and you are busy<SamEntity>: Do you reckon? Howcome?<ALeaf_OnThe_Wind>: Dude she just wants attention, she\u2019s playing you.<SamEntity>: Maybe... she's just told me she went out lastnight and ended up sleeping with her ex's mate... She said she'd rather be with someone yet I'm literally the answer she's looking for when it comes to a guy But she doesn't see it? Idk what to do<ALeaf_OnThe_Wind>: Ugh dude. Ima give you a wake up call. THIS PERSON IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. She\u2019s sleeping around with lots of different guys but she isn\u2019t sleeping with you. She likes your attention and she knows she can get it for free because you will still be around even if she doesn\u2019t fuck you. It does not matter if you are the guy she\u2019s looking for because some girls think they want something but their actions peak much louder than words. This female is not worth your time. Seriously. Ignore her. Cancel your plans with her, tell her you are busy. Worst case you lose contact with her, best case she responds to the ignoring and you get laid but do not I repeat DO NOT give her any more attention. She is not WORTHY. There. Now you know what to do. Whether you actually do it or not is up to you, best of luck mis amigo<SamEntity>: Okay, thank you very much it means alot you taking the time to tell me this, have a good rest of your day", "num_messages": 9, "avg_score": 1.2222222222}

And with herpes, don't assume that you're safe just because there's no visible outbreak - asymptomatic shedding is totally a thing. <Edit>: Looked it up.

He told me he was exhausted as his medical course was leaving him tired and with less energy to want sex as regularly. He had been avoiding talking to me all week and finally we sat down today because I told him his change is attitude was very hurtful as he was ignoring me. He had told me at that time that he was shocked that I was fine with him sleeping with another woman, and he repeated this. He would never be ok vice versa. I said that I feel completely secure in our relationship and knew that he was committed to me, so that was why him being sexual with another woman one off did not upset me. He said that he had no idea that I was into this kind of lifestyle, and I explained I wasn't and only intended to do this once. He even asked me if I felt unfulfilled sexually or whether I was coming out as bisexual and also into women. It is neither and I told him this repeatedly. I asked if he still had doubts about our future together and he remained quiet. I told him that his silence made me feel that he didn't want me anymore and he said he felt that he couldn't give me what I wanted, and it was worrying for him how different our views on sex and boundaries were. He said that he felt I would eventually start resenting him if he didn't try what I wanted, but if he did try it, he would be extremely uncomfortable and that he was totally monogamous. I told him that I was monogamous as well and that he was completely misunderstanding why I wanted it in the first place. It was more about ensuring that he doesn't lose interest any further in sex, and that something new might help us with that. After an hour long discussion, he couldn't say he still wanted to be with me. He said the key thing was that he was busier now than ever in his foundation course, which one has to do following the completion of the primarymedical degree in our country, and that he was only going to be even busier going forward, with greater workload and long hours. He said if I was unhappy now, things would be worse over time. He said this was not just about the threesome, but my reasons reflected a much larger problem in our relationship regarding my dissatisfaction about our sex life, possibly amount of time together, and views on intimacy and boundaries. He said it was better that we accepted this rather than settle down together with problems resurfacing again later. He said he couldn't continue the relationship, which left me absolutely devastated. He said that he would have to move out when our rental agreement period came to an end (we both pay towards it). We've been together for 6 years. This is two months from now so I repeatedly asked him to reconsider and not break up. Maybe take a break and take time to decide rather than rush into making a decision. He reluctantly agreed to this. So I have a couple of months to set things right again. How do I do this? TLDR My boyfriend nearly broke up with me today because I asked for a threesome following issues with our sex life, as his workload is increasing, and he fears he will have even less time for me. He is also worried about difference in values and boundaries. He plans to move out in two months when our rental agreement ends. How do I change his mind in these two months? We're on a break currently. <think-spot>: Don't, this guy seems really....dramatic and naive. Something really turns me off about how he's handled this. I can't agree with most of the responses you've gotten on here. I didn't know people so young are so uptight about sex and talking about it. Dam!!!! &amp;#x200B;<bd9597>: The strange thing is that he's in fact a very practical, rational and open minded man on most issues. He's usually straightforward and there's never been drama in our relationship. I don't know why he's been so different in handling this particular issue. It's very unlike him. <think-spot>: Was he raised by religious or conservative parents? I really think you should be considering your future with him too. He's hurting you, and for what?? I've been in and out of the dating world, monogamously and non-monogamously. The responses you're getting on here sound like bible bangers. Maybe that's offensive, but hey, they're trying to shame you for this and it boggles my mind. In my ADULT world, the only people who would react to your suggestion in such a way is someone who is very religious, or very naive and never was exposed to sexual experimentation. Do you want to cater to his sensitivity, or have a relationship with someone you can talk about anything with? I just cannot fathom someone in their 20s being so uptight. Unless you've been brainwashed. &amp;#x200B;<bd9597>: No, his family is not conservative or religious. He himself is agnostic. I have pretty much always been able to open up to him and talk about anything. Also wanted to add that he's not even uptight or vanilla in bed generally. He's always happy to experiment with me and try out new things. It's just that in the past, nothing in bed involved other people.<think-spot>: I am at a loss here. I guess I've surrounded myself with sexually open minded people who wouldn't flinch at your idea. His reaction would shock me. I don't think giving it a month to \"see\" how it goes is okay. That sounds like he's controlling the entire situation when this is a simple discussion to move on from. Unlike most posters here I understand this was not something you feel the \"need\" to do, or would even be disappointed at him saying no. I'm willing to bet he started having second thoughts before this and didn't communicate them to you. If he was fully in love with you, this would not be a deal breaker. UNLESS, he was really religious and it was way out of his ways of living. &amp;#x200B;<bd9597>: He wanted to break up immediately. I was the one who asked him to reconsider and take a break instead, to which he agreed. Our rental agreement ends in two months and he intends to move out. Before this threesome conversation came up, nothing in his attitude and behaviour suggested that he was having second thoughts. He seemed as committed as he was for all these years. Just that sexual intimacy was affected and it was gradually getting worse but he said he's exhausted from his foundation course.<think-spot>: well, maybe during your break you can detach from him. How committed could he have been if that's what drives him away so fast?<bd9597>: Committed enough for him to assure me on many occasions that we would marry after his foundation course was done. That is what hurts the most. I don't think, or actually, I know that I cannot detach myself from him easily, and definitely not while we live together. I don't want to break up at all but nothing has changed since the break conversation.<think-spot>: I'm sorry, I know it's easy for people to just tell you to break it off. You have to be mentally ready, and since this was so unexpected, I can see being really confused and conflicted. I do think you should stand up for yourself. Don't you want to know why he's made such a dramatic decision over something you thought he might actually be happy about? After 6 years, how he could just throw it all away? It's not like you did anything intentional to hurt him. <bd9597>: Yes, it was unexpected and I'm still shocked. It is also hurtful that he doesn't want to talk much. We have barely spoken for the past couple of days. I do want to understand his reasons a bit better than I do now, but for that he needs to open up to me once again. I don't know what to do or say that will make him open up to me again. We still live in the same house but it's incredibly lonely because his attitude towards me has completely changed.<pinepplegone>: &gt; I do want to understand his reasons a bit better than I do now, That is not true. He was very clear in explaining his reasons and many, many redditors tried to explain them to you. The truth is, you will never understand his reasons because they lead to a place you don't want to go. You don't want to listen to him at all, you want him to listen to you and pretend that he doesn't see you differently. <bd9597>: I don't want him to misunderstand me or my reasons. I don't know if he fully understands them even now. That's why I want him to listen to me.<maythefoxbwu>: \ud83e\udd26 Didn't he already listen to you? I thought you already told him your reasons? Why wouldn't he understand them? He's a smart guy right? Your reasons aren't complicated. Have you considered that he does fully understand your reasons? There is a strong chance that he understands your reasons better than you do. It isn't like you have something new to tell him do you unless you have manufactured something that you think sounds better? Neither repeating what you already said nor coming up with a new explanation are going to make any positive impact at all. In the first case, he will have already heard it and already made a decision with it in mind and in the second case, he'll just think you are fabricating a new story/excuse to try to exculpate yourself so he will come back to you.<bd9597>: Yes, but he wonders if I'm interested in exploring this as a lifestyle choice, which I do not. I tried to convince him over the weekend, but he wasn't convinced. Yes, he is a smart guy, but he isn't trying to understand where I was coming from. He's also under a lot of stress these days, which affects how he reacts and deals with issues.<maythefoxbwu>: Did he not try at all to understand? Did he ask you questions or give you a chance to explain? I don't understand either what you wanted. But then you may have explained things to him that you didn't state here because it is personal. But if you told him the same things, then I can understand why he doesn't understand or didn't take it the way you wanted him to because it isn't making sense to me either. If you thought you might like to explore this once, how do you know you wouldn't like it as a lifestyle choice? Maybe you would do it once and like it. And it would seem somebody already likes something to be interested in doing it at all. That is true about stress. <bd9597>: Yes, mostly what I posted here. He thought about it but didn't seem convinced. I wouldn't want polyamory as a lifestyle choice because I don't want him/us to involve others in a romantic relationship with us. That is also why I would not want to try a threesome more than once. It can get complicated. I managed to convince him to go for dinner with me tomorrow but I don't know if it'll lead to anything or make him open up more. <maythefoxbwu>: This might be difficult to talk about at dinner depending on whether anyone can hear your conversation. He might be uncomfortable if your conversation is audible. Try to gauge how he feels about that and how much privacy you have. Possibly, you might want to see if over dinner you can just get him to agree to talk to you elsewhere more private even if it is just sit in the car and talk somewhere before you go home.<Sawe651>: This is what I was thinking reading the comment. Would it not be better to use this opportunity to make dinner at home and talk there? If he's embarrassed and uncomfortable with this threesome talk, he certainly wouldn't want to discuss your views on them in a public place.<maythefoxbwu>: Yes, she'll have to be careful about how many people are around at dinner. I would likely not bring up the main issue at all. Better to try to enjoy the time together and try to get an agreement to talk about things after dinner in the car or at a park or something. I think a change of scene from the house might be good but I don't know really what would be best as far as that goes.<bd9597>: Yes, I know it's not the best place to talk openly about this and he wouldn't appreciate it if I did. But I just want him to talk and communicate in general. At the moment, we don't have that at all. I would prefer to talk about this at home preferably, after we get back from dinner.<maythefoxbwu>: That is smart. Have a nice, relaxed dinner out.<bd9597>: Thank you. Going in a couple of hours.<maythefoxbwu>: Wow! I hope you have a nice time.<bd9597>: Thank you. He's had a long, tiring week again, so hopefully he'll enjoy having some time out, too.<maythefoxbwu>: How did dinner go? I figure you two might be having a late night and you probably aren't on reddit at all tonight but you'll get this tomorrow or something like that.<bd9597>: It went ok, thank you. We didn't talk about anything major during the evening out. It was mostly just small talk and things from work, etc. It felt good to go out together despite everything that's happened. I did not expect things to just suddenly be fine between us, but it was much better than spending the whole week with him being distant and barely talking at home. We only talked about our problems again after we got back home. He said that he had not made his decision overnight. He had thought about it for days and he had come to the conclusion that we were not compatible and had had issues building up over time. He said that the threesome request was indicative of dissatisfaction and frustration building over a period of time. We don't spend as much time together now as we did when we first got together and moved in together. I had on a few occasions said things that he felt were signs of unhappiness in the relationship. Just things about not having much time together, about him being preoccupied with his training 24/7 when we did have time together, etc. I feel he took them into account more than he needed to, as we sometimes say things when we're a little frustrated, didn't mean I was resenting him or not happy being with him. But he felt like I had done it much more since his foundation programme began, and he didn't blame me. He understood, but that he couldn't give me what I wanted in terms of time, attention, etc. He said that my frustration was clear to him even before the problems about less sexual intimacy came up. He felt it went beyond sexual intimacy, and had affected our relationship. I had made a few comments when he sometimes cancelled plans with me because something came up for his training and he said I'd told him very clearly that I didn't feel like a priority in his life. I didn't even mean these comments, just said them in the moment, but he took them seriously. He said he spent nearly all the time that he had off with me, to plan things with me and ensuring that he showed me how much he cared, but I had seemed less and less happy over time and sometimes snapped at him. He said at times, he, too, didn't feel understood or appreciated by me, and he had said so, but I had done nothing about it. It's true that he did say so a few times, but this was during arguments and didn't come up again, so I paid less attention to them than if he'd initiated a conversation with me to discuss what he felt was lacking on my part. He also asked me why, after clearly telling me that he was exhausted and fatigued from training, would I even think that he had lost interest in me or tired of me. I told him it was something that worried me and he'd not responded to efforts from me to initiate things. I was slightly insecure that it was because it might have got boring after 6 years and he might have wanted to try something different. He said it was out of question that he would even consider bringing anyone, man or woman, into the bedroom with us, and it was of great concern to him that I thought it was ok to be casually inviting people to sleep with us. I told him my reasons that I've previously mentioned on here, and he said he was surprised how different our views on sexual boundaries were, and he had reservations about being with someone who could take this approach to sexual intimacy in a long term relationship. He asked me if it really was just for him. Same thing about whether I was interested in women as well. It wasn't about being into women for me but I admitted that it was something that sounded exciting and fun to me, and I didn't see it as a big issue unless we frequently brought people into our relationship. He said he sensed this and appreciated my honesty, but it reinforced his decision. He felt that we had somehow lost some of the emotional connection that we'd had in our years together because of how our lives and careers were shaping up, but now he realized our values were different, too. He said that he simply couldn't see how our relationship could be any better off in the future when he knew he'd only get busier and busier. He said that he knew I wasn't really getting what I wanted from a relationship, and that if it was already causing issues, he couldn't see how it would make sense to settle down together. <maythefoxbwu>: I was thinking about him saying things during arguments. I usually take very seriously the things people say when they are angry. A lot of truth comes out when somebody is too mad to filter what they are saying. My SO has said some awful things to me during arguments. He claims that he was only saying them to hurt my feelings but I have a hard time believing that. I guess it is possible some people will lie and come up with untrue horrible things to say just to cause pain to the other person because they are feeling mad but I don't know. I tend to think people's true ideas come out at those times. In any case, your boyfriend doesn't seem the type to say things that he doesn't mean, angry or not.<bd9597>: Yeah, I wish I'd picked up on that. As in, I didn't realise he was feeling this distance between us emotionally, or that he was really feeling underappreciated. I say several things when I'm angry that I didn't necessarily mean, but he took them seriously.<maythefoxbwu>: Are you sure you don't mean those things? Maybe you did mean them but didn't mean to say them. I say things during fights sometimes but it is always things that I do think sometimes but usually am good at not saying. Especially things about his mother. I think those things quite often... but when I am angry, I've actually said them a couple times. I've thought those things about a thousand times and only said them maybe twice when we were fighting. I've also thought things I've somehow managed not to ever say like she is really, really stupid. Damned but that woman is stupid. <bd9597>: I think things come out sounding much worse when I say them when I'm angry or arguing. So yes, there were times that I found it difficult to adjust to him being busy all day and then being called back unexpectedly at night, for instance. We ended up having a disagreement and I said things that I regret because I added to the stress he was under. But since then, I think I have coped better with the pressure and stress that has come with his foundation programme. I did not expect it to be worse than when he was in his primary medical degree, but now I know better.<maythefoxbwu>: So it isn't that you didn't mean them. They were things that were bothering you. It is better for you to admit that you meant it otherwise it is gaslighting. At least if you are straight forward about how you feel, then somebody can trust where you are coming from. And if you yourself are conscious of how you feel, you can work through it better. So later you could decide that you can accept and cope with his busy schedule and let him know that you are ok with it or else come to a compromise with him or something. Honesty is really important when working through things with somebody and that starts with honesty with yourself. So if you really meant the things you said at the time that you said them, you have to recognize that. If you pretend to yourself that you didn't mean it when you did, he'll pick up on that. It is really hard on a relationship when people aren't very direct about things because it feels like all sorts of things are lurking in the shadows and that everything is built of quicksand. Like it seems to me that you really did mean it when you complained about him being too busy for you. But then you turned around and claimed to him that you didn't really mean it. That is really frustrating to somebody when they are trying to talk about things in a relationship. Nothing makes me more angry or distrustful of my SO than when he says something to me when he is angry then he claims he didn't mean it. It makes me feel totally gaslighted. I am still pissed that he does that. I have to not think about that right now or I'll go start a fight, seriously. It makes you feel crazy when somebody does that. <bd9597>: I thought about this... I didn't mean them sometimes and they were a bit like a rant, and sometimes they sounded far worse than how I would have said things had I been calmer or if I'd said them while having a discussion. <maythefoxbwu>: Did you tell him that you didn't mean it later? <bd9597>: Yes, sometimes. But he said the other day that I said some of these things more than once, and he didn't see why I would repeat them if I did not mean them. <maythefoxbwu>: What if you really did mean them? What if you aren't being honest with yourself?<bd9597>: I didn't mean them. If I had any problem with him about something that needed to be resolved, I would bring it up with him when we weren't arguing.<maythefoxbwu>: What were yesterday and this morning like? Hopefully less awkward around the house since you guys started communicating again.<bd9597>: Yesterday and today were better. Less awkward and we are communicating a bit more. He has started looking for accommodation. Saw him looking at and replying to ads on an accomodation website yesterday.<maythefoxbwu>: I hope that you can stay on friendly terms after he moves out. He might not want to talk much at first. But you were friends for all these years and it is hard to lose a friend. Do you plan to keep living in your place? Or will you move as well? Your rent will double unless you get a roommate.<bd9597>: Yes, I'd like to be on good terms with him and continue to be friends with him. He's likely to move somewhere close by as he wants to continue to be in the area. I'm going to look for a housemate. Going to ask friends if they know anyone who's looking as there are always a large number of people looking in this city. I'm also making an ad to put out on a house/flat share website. It shouldn't be difficult to find a housemate. I have considered moving out, too, but if find a housemate, it should be fine. I have nearly two months as well.<Sawe651>: If he needs to remain in the area, why don't you move out instead?<maythefoxbwu>: He might not want to sign a new lease. If they have been there a long time, whichever of them stays should request a three month or six month lease anyway since this is likely to be a period of transition for both of them. I would ask for a shorter lease and see what the landlord says.<Sawe651>: She said in a previous post that the only reason he's moving is that he is the one breaking up, so he feels it would be wrong to ask her to go.<maythefoxbwu>: I did read that. He might have some additional reasons too. I wonder if she asked if he would want to stay if she moved instead. That might be a good question for him. Although it seems like she prefers to stay there and get a roommate.<bd9597>: We had that conversation the first time he told me he wanted to break up. He said he would stay if I didn't want to live here and if I preferred to move elsewhere, but that if I wanted to continue living here, then he will move.<maythefoxbwu>: That was nice of him.", "num_messages": 47, "avg_score": 4.1489361702}

She isn't the most horrible person in the world, but she needs to work on herself, and her partner deserves a chance to choose whether or not he wants that in his life.

Reddit may be majority male but you have no way of knowing the demographics(regular users) of any particular sub. Further I never said *anything* that could be considered being biased here. <keepthethe>: Obviously I haven't been keeping stats on this sub but it's kind of clear that women's issues aren't very well understood? And I'm pretty sure mostly everyone is aware that reddit is fairly male dominated. I've seen multiple posts on this sub and subs like it where a woman is clearly in a physically/mentally/sexually abusive relationship and the top comments are telling her how she can fix her relationship and a few comments down is finally someone being like, \"yo, youre in an abusive relationship, here are some resources for you.\" And sometimes that comment isn't there at all. If that isn't a sign that what happens to women isn't taken seriously then idk what is. I'm not saying it NEVER happens where the top comment is someone being genuinely helpful to an abused woman... but I've seen lots of posts where that just isn't the case. Maybe I misinterpreted desmedt's comment and they were saying they regularly come to the defense of unfaithful women, but that seemed like more of a blanket comment about the sub. It's not black in white comments of people straight up saying, \" women are dumb sluts so who cares\", it's an undertone. <rj2029x>: This happens to both genders though. There are plenty of posts where men are being abused and the top comments are \"happy wife, happy life\", \"maybe there's something she needs but doesn't know how to communicate it\", \"why do you keep making her mad\", \"ask her what she needs to be happy then do it\", or some variation. Yet that isn't causing me to say, \"I normally defend men on this sub\" because I don't. I look at situations and individuals, try to put myself on both sides, then give a response. Having a blanket defense policy for either gender is counter-productive and not the point of this sub. No one is proving the OC's point by saying this. What they are doing is saying that **people can be shitty** and gender is irrelevant in that.<keepthethe>: Except I was talking about women and gender is certainly not irrelevant. Women are much more likely to be abused. Of course women can be shitty, that\u2019s not the point. You are being purposefully obtuse. They said they\u2019re extra protective of women and were immediately questioned and then when I explained my own opinion you try to come to in with this \u201cone race, the human race\u201d type of thing. It\u2019s totally off base. <rj2029x>: Now you're being purposefully obtuse. I supported the fact that blanket defending one gender or another is not a healthy or beneficial way to participate in an advice sub. Each situation is unique and coming up with some seat of the pants statement like 'reddit is mostly guys that hate women' does not make it true. Nor does it justify a stance of \"automatically\" defending women. People are people and if advice is going to be given then the usual best practice is to come at the situation from a neutral position, read the situation, process the situation, and advise from there. Not jump into a post with your shield out and ready to defend women based on a misguided and unproven idea that people are somehow targeting or mistreating them any more than any other gender.<keepthethe>: Honestly you just don\u2019t want to listen. You\u2019re so busy putting words in my mouth you can\u2019t take a minute to understand where I\u2019m coming from. \u201cPeople are people\u201d yeah I guess there are no distinguished groups huh?

He apologized, and said he'd stop, but he did tell me to stop overthinking things. sigh. He said he'd stop if i stop making fun of HIS appearance - because i told him to shave. is telling someone to shave, shower after they havent in days mean? i try my best to be so nice to him about his hygeine and i dont even complain if he hasnt brushed his teeh or hasnt showered in days. hygiene and making fun of how someone wears their hair is different to me? i have no idea where else to go with this conversation. i dont feel like its done or resolved but i can tell he wants it to be over. this happens any time i bring something up. he always turns it onto something else and the main focus of the conversation is gone. I've really contemplated even making a post about this, but it's been bugging me. Weve been together since October 2017. Last weekend my boyfriend came to visit (he lives close to where home is, but im away at school rn). He doesn't like my hair much and I know this, but each time he sees me I feel like the remarks are getting more frequent and blunt, therefore more hurtful. I have long, curly auburn red hair, and i shave the sides. ive been doing this since September. When he was here, we planned to go to breakfast the next morning. Well, the entire morning he kept making remarks saying he didnt want to go anywhere if i had my hair up (you cant tell it's shaved when it's down). He went on with this for a while. He was still in bed and he had me put his hair into a shitty man bun as a joke. However, when we were in the bathroom about to leave, he said he wasn't going to take his hair down because he knows he looks ugly and he was trying to get at me for not wearing my hair the way he likes, so i cried. Just some tears, but i didnt wanna look at him. He never apologized for making me cry or feel like shit, and it seems like he just wanted to push the blame off of himself. He told me I'm a big baby about it. honestly that shit wouldnt bug me if anyone else had said it, but thats my boyfriend, so it just really hurts. There's a lot of shitty things that i let him get away with but if i try to talk about anything personal to his appearance or hygiene or the way he treats me, he just gets really defensive, says he doesn't wanna talk about it and avoids consequences as if it wasnt his fault or not something he should be punished over. Besides that, he's always shitting on things that I'm interested in (such as music, video games, etc) so i don't like to share much of that with him. our daily conversation is lackluster. it feels hard to talk to him about things like this, because i dont know how to properly bring it up? i always get shut down when i do. idk, i love him, but lately i feel strained and unappreciated. TLDR; my boyfriend says increasingly blunt and hurtful things about my hair and made me cry. Is this kind of shit normal in a longer relationship? Its my first serious relationship. I shouldn't think the teasing makes someone feel awful lmfao. how do i approach this as a conversation with him?<Steve138>: This guy is a dick to you. Plain and simple. Why continue to open yourself up to somebody who just shuts you down? You deserve so much better.<Polymelus>: thats a great question lmao. i could go on and on about the shit that he does but i dont say anything about. honestly i just need to talk to him or leave and i cant bring myself to do either.<hampri>: Just saw your edit, this dude goes days without brushing his teeth and showering??<Polymelus>: lol he's usually good about brushing his teeth but yeah he doesn't shower much. its a little off putting if he's with me for the weekend and doesnt shower the entire time. i try to say stuff about it but tbh im really just way too nice about it", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 7.0}

Is it normal, or am I just overanalyzing things. She text me different, usually with less funny pictures and more meaningful statements. Here's the kicker though. He calls her cutie. He's told me in person that he's interested in her. He calls her cutie over text. Now, obviously I can't just outright tell her anything, Because then she'll know I caught a glance. She said I love you to him in person, while we were holding hands, so I guess it's normal. I'm just trying to get some other opinions. Edit One: Wow, thanks everyone, seriously. I talked to her just before we left school, we ride separate buses. She was very quiet, and spoke very softly, which usually means she's distressed. I told her how it would feel if it was a girl best friend calling me cutie. She agreed with me, I think. I told her how uncomfortable it makes me, that he is very clearly into her and the whole \"I love you\" thing. She has some extracurriculars, so I won't hear from her until around 4:45. Thanks everyone, so much. I'll let you all know what went down. Edit Two: Nothing yet from her, but I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, because her phone battery is straight booty. If I don't hear from her this evening, assume all has gone wrong. Edit Three: So, being 17, I have a momma to talk to. So, that's exactly what I did. I went driving with her, I've got to get those permit hours in somehow, and she and I both agreed to just let it ride for a day, see what she does, don't pressure her. However, come Monday, I will confront the guy who is the troublemaker. Obviously, I won't fight him, but he needs to explain himself and his actions. Thank you all for the continual support, I love you all. Edit Four: Alright guys, here's the stunning conclusion to this saga. He called me, and apologized. He didn't know it was an issue, because apparently flirting with someone in a relationship isn't an obvious problem. He said \"It may have been bad\", but it most certainly was, he didn't get away with that. The girl is feeling much better now, so all things considered, we have come out of this stronger than we were going into it. Thank you all, even the \"You're 17 shut up fag\" comments. I love you all unconditionally. Night y'all.<Bedtimeshine>: Your gonna learn the hard way not to commit to girls with male best friends. You want the advice of an experienced man twice your age? Keep it casual, let her do what she wants, invest elsewhere.... sports, school, lifting weights, and other girls.<Two_Ton_Twenty_one>: I'm a woman (32), I've had a male best friend for 20+ years. The vast majority of my close friends are men, I have only a small number of close female friends (4 including my sister). I am currently in a long-term relationship (~7 years), we are extremely close and very happy, and it has never once been an issue. I am about to be a groomsmaid in my male best friend's upcoming wedding, and I will be hosting the baby shower for his soon-to-be-wife in June. Also, he and I tell each other we love one another, because we are like family, and we have been like family for a long time. We are not sexually attracted to one another. I wouldn't sleep with him under any circumstance, because it's just not like that. In fact, I wouldn't sleep with any of my close male friends *because it is not like that.* Women and men can absolutely be friends without it being weird or sexual. I've been doing it my whole life.<Bedtimeshine>: Do me a favor. Text each and every one of these guys and ask if they\u2019d like to get sexual. Your phone will blowing up with them falling all over themselves at the offer. Because it IS like that... always has been, always will be. And you ARE the exception to the rule.<Two_Ton_Twenty_one>: If I did that, they would be VERY creeped out, and rightly so. All of these people have had over a decade to make a move on me if they were interested, so I'm pretty sure if they wanted to make a pass at me, it would have happened a long, long time ago. I'm not denying that sometimes someone who you see purely as a friend ends up wanting more, and that can be a little awkward. But that's not the norm, and most friendships don't go that route. Even if it does happen, if your friendship is solid enough, you can get past it with an adjustment period. There is absolutely nothing unique about me. There is no fucking way I am an exception to ANY rule. Sounds like you got burned by a girl hooking up with some dude who she said was just a friend. That's a lying issue on her part, man, not a friendship between men and women issue.<Bedtimeshine>: I\u2019m willing to bet you do it right though. I bet you aren\u2019t texting these dudes non stop, your not flirting with them, you\u2019re not talking about sex, your not \u201cventing\u201d about your man and they arent disparaging him either, they aren\u2019t just your friends one on one... they are friends of the relationship, there no sexual history between you and any of those guys, and your transparent. Sound about right? And I\u2019d argue that most male female friendships DO go that route. Overwhelmingly so.<Two_Ton_Twenty_one>: My best friend and I talk or text just about every day. I've been texting with him all morning because he and his soon to be wife just got some good ultrasound pics of their little one. And no, there is some romantic history with some of these people. Most of them I have never been romantically involved with, but a few (3 out of 12) of my closest, most cherished friendships actually started out as romantic. We just figured out pretty quickly that we were much better friends than romantic partners. Those friendships had a brief period of adjustment after the relationship ended, but as time passed, they ended up fine. They are all in relationships with other people and some are having kids. I know their partners. We all get along. I had dinner with one of them (alone, I invited my SO but he declined, he's an introvert) two nights ago because he and his gf of 2 years broke up and he is having a rough time and needed a sympathetic ear. No weirdness happened. As far as venting goes, I don't have anything to vent about. Seriously. My SO and I are about as close as you can get and we are extremely happy. We just bought a house together. My best friend vents to me sometimes about his fiancee (they bicker a bit but nothing serious, her pregnancy hormones are going a little crazy) and we absolutely have had thousands of conversations about sex, but in the context of whatever relationship either of us was in at the time, it was NOT about sex with each other. No topic has ever been \"weird\" for us to discuss, for whatever reason we just arent like that. I've always been up front with any potential partners about my male friends. I've always just said, \"hey, almost all of my very close friends are men. I'm not attracted to them, they aren't attracted to me. We've been friends for many years. If that's not something you can be ok with then we'll go our separate ways and no hard feelings. But I will not stop talking to these people, and if you start getting jealous over these purely platonic friendships, we will have problems. I don't want to be in a relationship with any of them, I want to be in a relationship with you. So if you're cool with that, let's move forward. If not, thanks for the lovely times.\" I don't feel like this is unique. The few female friends I have all have similar situations and handle things the same way.<Bedtimeshine>: I\u2019m sorry my friend, but this is EXTREMELY unique. The are the exception to the rule of how male female interaction plays out.<Two_Ton_Twenty_one>: So I'm supposed to believe that I and all the women I am close with are some sort of unicorn colony? There is just nothing unusual about me. I'm a run-of-the-mill nerdy scientist. I have a tiny purse dog. My favorite color is hot pink. I paint my toenails. I'm pretty \"regular.\"<derkapitan>: Maybe yeah... That sounds a bit off-putting to me.<Two_Ton_Twenty_one>: It just seems incredibly unlikely that somehow I am this super different woman from alllll the other women on the planet. Also, what's off putting? My tiny dog?<derkapitan>: Hard to say, the only evidence I have to the contrary is my circle of friends and family. Example: My sister 10 years older than me and is a social animal. She's a wonderful person and has definitely helped me have, what I think is, a good view on feminism and woman's rights. She's a high profile make-up artist, makes enormous amounts of money. Spent most of her career in New York City. She's had thousands of guy friends, clients, boyfriends. Some of which stayed very close friends. Until she settled down and got married...When I was dating girls and ran into the usual issues about trust and anxiety about guy or girl friends her advice to me was \"They just don't work most of the time, especially if it makes your SO uncomfortable. She said there's almost always a tension there, not for her but for them. That it's very rare to have a true BFF guy friend(or vice versa for me) . She said out of the thousands of people she's knows or known, she has one. One that she and her husband are comfortable friends with. He's a world traveling millionaire whom she treats like a pen pal. I don't know everything, or claim to be right here. Just my 2 cents. Guy friends for my long term girlfriend still make me uncomfortable, especially ex's but I trust her. If she ever started getting more friendly than an occasional text. I'd definitely have an issue. Just as I know she'd feel the same way if I suddenly started spending time with my ex's or made a bunch of female friends. Who knows though that would be out of character for both of us. All I'm saying is maybe your situation is unique. More and more I'm realizing the impact of sample sizes. Even if your whole city is a certain way that still may not be statistically relevant in the big picture. I'm looking at you Donald Trump. Tiny dogs are rad.<Two_Ton_Twenty_one>: That's actually a really good point you make about it possibly being a regional thing. I'm on the west coast, so maybe it's just more culturally accepted here. You raise a good point. But my original point still remains that if these friendships are working out for at least some percentage of the population, it is unfair to say that none of them ever work and that all of them are secretly jerking off to the thought of each other. Because that just cannot be the case if I, everyone I know, and my own SO operate this way. I am a scientist (Micro/Molecular Biologist) and the biologist in me just has a hard time thinking that I am somehow different from the vast majority of other female Homo sapiens.<derkapitan>: Not subject that can be over simplified imo. I don't think it's impossible. Just not a common thing.<Two_Ton_Twenty_one>: Sure, I get what you mean. The original guy that I commented to said that it's impossible, that it never works, there is no such thing as platonic friends between sexes, that everybody is secretly wanting to fuck each other, etc. My only point to him was that true platonic friendship not as uncommon as he thinks, and certainly not impossible.", "num_messages": 15, "avg_score": 686.3333333333}

I have been with my girlfriend for 7 years now, since school. Unfortunately her parents are Indian and are very strict which leads to us having to conceal our relationship. In these 7 years I can probably count with my hands how often we have seen each other in person over the weekend. We usually Skype but never meet in person because of her strict family who would disown her if they found out about us, perhaps worse. Even though we study in the same university and basically do everything together, it still puts a huge strain on our relationship. While she still lives with her parents, I live in a student house (a small building with many individual rooms and some common rooms). Every other weekend I go to visit my parents by train (living in Europe). I go on Friday afternoon and return to my student room Sunday afternoon. From my parents to my rooms it goes: train -&gt; change train -&gt; tram -&gt; walk-&gt; room. For the last half a year or so I have been taking the tram and walking with the same girl who lives in my building, who also happens to be there waiting for the tram at the same time on Sundays (we also talk throughout the week in the building. The talking just started in the tram and it became a small ritual for us to always take that tram and talk/walk together). I am a very monogamous person and in some aspects somewhat old fashioned. So I never really developed feelings towards anyone before or had intense sexual thoughts. I can acknowledged a girl as pretty but I wouldn't really care or stare. This girl is different though. I really like talking to her, we understand each other, she is adventurous and in a lot of ways the opposite of my girlfriend. For the first time ever, I even find myself thinking of her and my heart racing every time I see her. It got to the point where I am scheduling my life in such a way that I can be there to take the same tram as her. I find her really attractive and she has expressed feelings towards me too, so I know if I were to make a move I would be successful. When we first started talking I was happy because it's cool to meet new people, specially ones that like to talk and are open like her. But somewhere along the way it stopped being .... so innocent, for lack of a better definition. My girlfriend even knows I talk to her and we take the tram together and so on. I never tried to hide it. I also find myself disgusted by me for acting like this and having these feelings. A lot of questions have been in my mind lately: Should I stop talking to this girl? Is it normal to feel this way at some point for another woman? Can it be that my subconscious wants me to start a relationship with someone who doesn't have the \"parent\" problem? I should mention that lately my girlfriend (whom I still love very much) and I are really stressed because of her family and culture. Her parents/family are putting more and more pressure on her to get married (to someone they choose and of the same culture), being two broke students we don't have a lot of money to start a life together (my country is very expensive to live) and the whole secrecy thing really does a number on me.... But we have been together for 7 years now. Can it be that I am getting fed up NOW? After 7 years? &amp;#x200B; I am sorry if this is too long or if it is hard to follow. English is not my first language and I am quite confused with all these feelings and thoughts... I just don't know what I should do but I know I have to do something because I am struggling with myself over all of this. If someone needs more info on the matter I will gladly provide it but perhaps only tomorrow seeing that it's very late. &amp;#x200B; Thank you very much in advance<Beamer90>: If the situation with the parents bothers you talk with her.

We talked about it numerous times and we want to change it as soon as we have a degree and full time jobs (i work part-time). But I don't know if I can make it that long.

Nothing but there's just one way to find out and you have to find out now not years down the road. Tell her how you feel, tell her you can't do this anymore and that the hiding is over.

I\u2019ve been in a committed relationship for just about three years. I constantly worry about my future and make okay money. I can\u2019t see myself saving any significant amounts of money to afford a down payment and moving back in with my parents would help to free up expenditures to save for a down payment. I don\u2019t want to be in a position where I\u2019m doing this five years down the line. I sometimes have second thoughts about the fact that my partner and I moved in so early in, and this is one of the factors heavily contributing to my recent intrusive thoughts about ending the relationship. I\u2019ve been feeling this way for a while, and I feel it\u2019s unfair to both of us to keep going while having apprehensions. <English_Guy_>: 2 can live as cheaply as 1, I thought was the saying. Odd way to behave. Is your mind made up?<Downplayment>: Maybe it is, but I\u2019m unsure what Words im looking for from random strangers on reddit. It would be moving back in with my parents for free, so 4-5k difference yearly. Whom, along with my siblings, I believe I need the mental support and guidance from. I\u2019ve never been good at having many things on my plate, all I can manage currently is working and chores around the apartment end up eating most my free time. When I could be having rent paid for and meals provided most days. <English_Guy_>: That was my next question what random words would you like? 3 years, are you breaking up completely? I'm a bit confused as to what is the actual question here?<Downplayment>: I guess I have a lot going on that\u2019s contributing to my uneasiness surrounding the relationship. I\u2019ve had underlying doubt of the relationship for what I feel is an unhealthy amount of time. I think it\u2019s more internal existential problems than externally from the relationship, so I feel it\u2019s problems with myself not fixable relationship circumstances. I feel overcommitted I guess in my situation I\u2019ve never wanted to be fully committed before I have some semblance of career path etched out, which I don\u2019t. I just don\u2019t see a straight line between where we\u2019re at and marriage. First serious relationship, lost virginity to the gal. I haven\u2019t don\u2019t this before, both a serious relationship or ending one and it feels like the lack of experience clouds my judgement. <English_Guy_>: So is this more what is the point of this relationship? I'm still trying to decide what I want out of life such as career goals, my ideal women, morals, me! Is that your dilemma, you don't know what you what and your not sure you have tried enough things to be sure? <Downplayment>: To a degree, sounds selfish but I can hide my contemplations from all but myself. Sometimes feel like we jumped into this too hard too fast and here I am a few years later not really sure if we\u2019re the best for each other at this moment. I don\u2019t think she would agree, but equally so I feel Im holding her back from finding something and we\u2019re building an unhealthy codependency I\u2019ve been warning her I want to avoids <English_Guy_>: So really you think backing off, a cooling down is what is best? Like a trial separation.<Downplayment>: We\u2019ve been sailing the same ship for a while. We don\u2019t have our own independent lives, just slivers of that, and then this ship.

(Repost)<Edit>: been receiving a lot of nasty responses to this. I\u2019d like some more level-headed ones especially from people whose spouses are very emotional/dramatic/needy. Thanks. 32M] once called my wife [29F] A toxic person, a piece of sh*t and some other stuff after a heated argument. I had put some rules on her to contribute more financially (I admit, I was very angry at the time) afterward. We\u2019ve been married for a few months and had a 2 year relationship before we got married. She paid the bills and occasional groceries, but I wanted her to help more with the rent. I decided we need to split costs in percentages (they were in her favor because she earns less than me) because I wasn\u2019t happy with how much she was contributing. I didn\u2019t apologize for calling her names as I felt I was in my right because she wanted me to pay for her clothes that day indirectly. She didn\u2019t ask me to, but she was complaining to me about how expensive they were and I took it as an indirect jab as \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you suggest to pay for it\u201d. She denied it but I flipped and said this was toxic behavior. Especially cause I said sorry and she said my sorry wasn\u2019t \u201cgenuine\u201d. She became depressed after the argument and the rules I laid down, she stopped taking care of herself as much, she was having problems at work at the same time, that I knew at the time. She didn\u2019t cook and clean as much anymore and I resented the fact she wanted a cleaner to help in the weekends. She spiraled down more and kept demanding I apologize for the rules and the names I called her. I refused and kept my foot down. I wouldn\u2019t apologize to her in a 100 years because she kept asking me why I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t apologize just because I\u2019m asked to.She\u2019d cry a lot but I believe she was exaggerating. One day she flipped and kept yelling for me to get out of the house and she\u2019d call the police if I didn\u2019t . I didn\u2019t and I shoved her out of my way because she was standing and raising her voice in my face demanding an apology. She fell but I didn\u2019t check on her, because I think she was overdoing the whole fall to the ground. I was also offended she was threatening to call police. She ended up staying at her parents that night and after a while she called me crying to apologize and if I could come pick her up. I suppose I did but I started disliking her from that point onward. She became more and more depressed and I resented her even more. I was tired of all the crying, it seemed to be a ploy to get my attention in my eyes. I thought it was a bit overdone. I told her this and it made her feel worse. One day, she called me to tell me she passed out at work. She had been having troubles sleeping, back aches and the like, but I was cold on the phone. I thought she called me to make me feel guilty. she said she couldn\u2019t take it anymore and wanted a divorce. I remained cold when I got home. She was on the couch with tears i. Her eyes after resting at her parents house. She asked me why I was doing this to her and I answered it\u2019s good that she wants a divorce. She then completely flipped. Started shoving me and trying to remove me from the room, physically. She kept pushing me and kept standing in my face like a bully. She wanted me out of the house and ended up packing my stuff with me and she drove me to a hotel. I was done and filed for a divorce. I don\u2019t know how she was doing afterward but her laying her hands on me was the last straw. I saw how she could become when angry and didn\u2019t want anything to do with that anymore. I\u2019m a bit conflicted as she keeps telling me that she was genuinely depressed and miserable by my actions that led to her meltdown. She apologized, but I don\u2019t think what I did was so bad that she would flip that way. I think that\u2019s just the way she is and I honestly can\u2019t deal with it. I understand she loves me, but she is too dependent on me and asks for emotional support she should give herself, she can\u2019t just rely on me for that and the moment I can\u2019t give it throw a tantrum. Once she got upset with me because she was in the bedroom crying about an argument and I didn\u2019t check on her for at least 2 hours. It makes no sense to me to get upset about things like that. TL;DR: set rules for my wife to ensure more financial contribution and support, called her names and didn\u2019t apologize, she became depressed and physical. Am I really at fault or is just her personality. <startingover00>: You're not responsible for anyone else's reactions. However, in a committed relationship you are partially responsible for their feelings, which lead to their actions. Relationships have that way of blurring lines. You approached the situation wrong first of all. And I really don't want to be overtly offensive, but you were coming off as a complete ass in that post. No one cares if your needs are justified if you can't set that ego aside and work it out with your hurting wife. Revisit the issue after you've talked and gotten to a better place and rethink how you approached everything. You don't set rules on your partner, she's not your pet or child. I'm speaking from experience. I acted this way toward my ex bf of 6 years and, well, you see what the title implies. You've both got a chance to walk away from this happy and together.<yas1189>: Thanks for the response, appreciated. I know I can be blunt but I\u2019d rather be matter of fact than sugarcoat things.

At the end of the day you have to take care of yourself too, and if you\u2019re both not willing to put in the work it\u2019s a moot point. Maybe time to cut ties and move forward with a partner who is better suited to your emotional output. <yas1189>: What kind of personality would you think would fit mine? <needacoldshower>: It sounds like you are not on the same wavelength as her regarding emotional needs. All I know is what you\u2019ve posted/commented, but it sounds like she needs someone who is more hands on emotionally and you\u2019re not able to give her the amount she requires to be secure. I would think that you would be better suited to someone who is more logical and more independent when it comes to emotional support. <unsafeideas>: More \"logical\" person would dump him quick tho. More independent person would break after first attempt to \"put some rules on her\" or him \"keep foot down\". Emotionally independent person would figure out what he is doing to her before developing emotional ties to him.", "num_messages": 10, "avg_score": 1.3}

She's in this hot sorority so they do all of this weird, demeaning shit. It probably sounds nice, like a porno came to life or something. But honestly, these car washes, wet T shirt contests, bikini fashion shows. they bother me the shit out of me. She tries to justify it by saying it's for charity and she's helping hungry children but wtf I don't like it. I am not controlling or weird. I don't give a shit if she wears the skimpiest bikini, or wears a shirt with no bra and it starts raining. But the whole idea of purposely trying to get wet to show her boobs the most she can without taking her shirt off or flaunting around so guys get horny and bring more money or friends that will bring money is just too much like prostitution to me This sounds kinda fucked but her sorority has a separate \"fun\" snapchat that people have to pay for. Their official social medias are more pg and wholesome. Their fun snapchat shows their slutty shit (im sorry but its true) and that's how they're getting some of their money She is loyal to me but they are super close with one of the other frats and they do everything together. They partner up for charity drives and parties and vacations. And there's this one guy that she is always with. I couldn't go with her this spring break but I saw on their snap, they were all in the pool and she was on his shoulders and his head was like, right next to her pussy and he was holding her thighs and that makes me feel fucking weird. She insists that it's just platonic but it's hard that she's telling me one thing and I see other shit in the snaps. This all really bothers me and I've tried talking to her about it but she insists it's just fun and she's not cheating. I told her that I cannot deal with it and that we should break up but she starts crying and says she needs me and loves me and that I have to trust her because she's really not messing with other guys. I do love her so we stay together but she doesn't lay off on this stuff Recently, her sorority went out to a party and I am serious about my classes now so I don't go to every party and I find out a lot of shit from their fun snapchat. party was near the beach and they all went streaking. They recorded it and put it on snap and she showed her ass but she covered her nipples with her hands but cmon everyone already knows what it looks like from the wet t shirt shit, they can put 2 and 2 together and cut, copy, paste and have an image of her fully nude in their mind. that was too fucking far for me and I broke up with her but she went hysterical on me, crying and begging me not to and that she loves me, etc. I love her but it seems like she doesn't respect me or herself. and now all her \"sisters\" are talking shit about me on their finstas saying im a slut shamer and I don't respect women and Im an anti feminist and im fucking disgusting for not supporting her and letting her make her own choices? She keeps texting me and seeing me on campus and she wants to get back together. She saw me in the library and started crying and saying she missed me. it was the quiet study area so we went outside and talked and she is really messed up. I really do love her and miss her but this is too much so I told her it was over for real and she kept crying. I felt really fucking horrible for doing that but I couldn't deal with all that. They're planning a spring formal shit in school, something like prom, and she made this whole big \"promposal\" for me, it was a play off my favorite song and it was really sweet and she obviously put a lot of work into it so I accepted because it was in public and I didn't want to embarrass her but I don't know. was I overreacting about the streaking <KippleAlwaysWins>: Hey man, this is a tough situation. It can be hard to accept, but different people have different boundaries. The place she is in is outside your comfort zone for a partner. It doesn't matter if all her sisters say it's ok, it's not ok for someone you are dating. Sadly that means you need to find someone else to date. If she reels it in, she will feel left out. If you get back together, your're going to keep feeling like shit as she continues to do what she has been doing. It seems like your boundaries just aren't compatible. <throwaway128346part2>: Actually, I am getting some vibes from this post - that she may have cheated on him already. She's already broken his boundaries, so it's not too far of a stretch to say that she's already cheated with the frat bro. Also, the whole promposal sounds super manipulative, doing it in a public place so he can't say no. OP should run from this girl and her batshit crazy \"sisters\".<StraightNewspaper4>: I thought she may have cheated too but I don\u2019t really think so. Not trying to be conceited but she\u2019s pretty crazy about me, if she were cheating I thought she\u2019d just get over the break up And yeah the promposal was an awkward situation for me. She definitely took advantage of me, I didn\u2019t wanna embarrass her or anything but I could have easily said no but she knew I wouldn\u2019t do that to her <throwaway128346part2>: She 100% manipulated you with the promposal. Why not leave her dude? She's gonna be \"wild\" for the rest of college, she'll keep breaking boundaries to appease her sorority \"sisters\" and incite sexual excitement from the frat.", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 15.4}

It\u2019s hard to understand the kind of person he is without meeting him but this is the most genuine man I\u2019ve ever met in the world. When we first got together he showed me all of his old tinder messages and it was literally all memes. He has never been with anyone else and never showed interest in anyone else. But he also is new to the dating thing and doesn\u2019t really understand how it\u2019s supposed to be yet. He\u2019s completely drama free and never has bad intent so I know he isn\u2019t doing this on purpose. My guess is that he forgot we even talked about it at all because unless you make things really clear with him it\u2019ll fly right over his head. Not great with cues.<blueyedsoulxo>: Okay I relate to this comment a lot my boyfriend was the same, never had a girlfriend or anything and I literally had to teach him how one works. So I understand and in that case honestly talk to him about it again, I mean if you\u2019re sure he\u2019s not doing anything bad on it then that\u2019s fine! But id for sure mention it again just to be sure :) <RealRavioliJones>: Okay great I\u2019ll do that! He just isn\u2019t confrontational at all so it\u2019s sometimes a little harder to talk to him about more difficult things because of how rare we have to talk about that stuff.<blueyedsoulxo>: Yeah just bring it up in casual conversation maybe find a Tinder meme and laugh about it and ask if he still uses tinder to look/make them? Just be cool about it don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re patronising him if that makes sense <RealRavioliJones>: No I know he does. He\u2019s open about having one he wasn\u2019t hiding it. I just genuinely think he forgot that I said it was a bit uncomfortable for me because it was like a 30 second conversation. He doesn\u2019t have the best memory when something isn\u2019t said directly to him. And yeah that\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about. I don\u2019t know if he remembers I already mentioned it and I don\u2019t want to be controlling and I\u2019m just really trying to not worry too much about it.

How should I respond? I've mentioned to my girlfriend recently that I'm thinking of buying a new phone. My current one has a bunch of new cracks on the screen from dropping it and it's battery life is getting shorter everyday. I guess she must've mentioned it to her parents because yesterday, she invited me over to their place because her dad apparently had a surprise for me. I went over really nervous since her dad isn't a big fan of mine at all, but he actually gave the box for an iPhone XR. He said that he felt bad about us not getting along and he bought it for me as a peace offering. I didn't even know what to say. I opened up the box...and it was just full of rocks to make it seem heavier than it really was. There was no iPhone in it and the dad laughed and said that it was just the box for his XR that he got as a Christmas gift. My girlfriend looked just as shocked as me and she explained to me that she had no idea he was going to do this. I just threw the rocks onto the ground and yelled at her dad for being an asshole. He started yelling at me to leave and I did. This may seem like a harmless prank, but I know her dad. He doesn't like me at all given our recent history together and was doing this prank out of maliciousness. I'm thinking of how I should respond. Part of me wants to try and get him back with a prank of my own, or get revenge to some degree. What should I do?<eyebehold>: My favorite people in the world have this ability to laugh at a joke and brush things off like they don\u2019t matter. He loves his daughter and you are the guy that wants to do terrible things to her in his eyes. You wouldn\u2019t like you either if you were in his shoes. His joke is really pathetic but you should have seen it from a mile away. I\u2019ve never gotten a gift from a girlfriends Father ever and would never expect to. A meal paid for here and there but I\u2019ve always tried to return the favor if I could. Learn to let go of things, I know is probably embarrassing not to have the nicest things but it builds character and your girlfriend seems to be more interested in you and not your material things. Be happy for that. <intentamos_de_nuevo>: Jesus, you have a poor view of men. When I see my friends and family\u2019s loved ones, I don\u2019t see the guys as being there to do \u201chorrible things\u201d to women. That\u2019s not natural.<eyebehold>: If you don\u2019t start doing some things to your lady that her Pop would call horrible, she\u2019ll probably find a guy who will. Pull her hair, choke her when she climaxes (I\u2019m making assumptions here) call her some fucked up names, or do it in a not so discreet place. Women are just as perverted as men and the things we want to do, they often are game for, if you have the balls to try. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be angry or say \u201cthat\u2019s horrible\u201d to do to your daughter, if you had one. Simple expression and a bit of humor I was implying is all. This guy is young and probably Does not stop thinking about what he wants to do with his GF if he could, as most guys did at that age. I would try to articulate better if I wasn\u2019t more interested in doing things that would make my wife blush to talk about. Hope that helps you better understand my wording in the previous post. <intentamos_de_nuevo>: I am a woman. I have no desire for a guy to do those things to me. And don\u2019t do those things without consent.<eyebehold>: First, I apologize my humor is being taken the wrong way. What you like and other people are into is not to be taken as doing something without someone consent. Of course never do that! The kid is having a tough time with his gfs dad and made the mistake of yelling at the guy. The dad wasn\u2019t very nice about things but he wanted to see how this guy would react and he failed. It\u2019ll be a good lesson in life for him to process his feelings before reacting and making a bad situation worse. It\u2019s tough enough to want the approval from your gfs parents, let alone to have this type of conflict. I commend him in reaching out for advice, be it good or bad, it means he cares enough to better himself and the situation. If anything, he should probably suck it up and apologize to the father for calling him a name, say he didn\u2019t get the joke and was embarrassed. Having the heart to heart with her father is the best thing he can do from this point and if the dad wants to continue to be a jerk, that\u2019s on him but it will show that he is willing to be mature and attempt to earn the fathers respect <Lukaroast>: You made a good point, people are just nitpicking you in the Classic reddit style", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 16.4285714286}

For him it's marriage/children. Likely his perspective is a dog isn't as serious as children or marriage. If you lose a dog or have to break up and one person gets the dog, it's not as bad for some people as thinking about messing up a kid's life. He's 26 years old, he may know that you are the one he wants to marry or he may be unsure. Either way, he's young, and not ready to think about the permanancy that comes with marriage or kids. The good news is this means he treats marriage seriously. The bad news is it makes it harder to talk to him without scaring him. For you it's not as scary, but for him if he messes up he knows it will haunt him forever. Currently the risk of screwing things up is too high to see the future. It's like he's staring down the barrel of the gun and told that if he doesn't love you forever, he will be shot. It's not that he doesn't love you, but the future can be terrifying. What can help is stability, kindness, and love. You are ready, you know what you want, and want him to come along. If you continue to be with him and care for him, he will realize over time that the future doesn't need to be scary, because you'll be there with him. The longer your relationship lasts, the more he can get the other things holding him back figured out. It's all about love and time. What's the rush? You don't need to get married anytime soon do you?<BlueWolf2018>: No, nor do I want to get married or have kids within the next 5 years. I do a lot for us, like a lot lot. I make the most, I clean the house, cook the meals, and care for him and our pet. I\u2019m there when he calls, and drop everything when he needs me. He has thanked me countless times for giving him a life he always wanted. So for me, if he never sees it happening or thinks he wants to move on from me for whatever reason in the future it\u2019s a big risk for me emotionally. I\u2019m giving more than 100% of myself because it\u2019s I love him. I just want to make sure we\u2019re in the same mindset that this is our goal. We don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get there and we know it\u2019s not happening soon but we both want it WITH each other. Is that really hard to ask for?<paradoxium777>: It can be that hard to ask for. What makes you the most nervous? For me it's thinking something terrible has happened to my SO when they have no contact with me for 24 hours. For some this may be clingy, for me it calms my fears. When I get nervous, my mind goes into panic mode, imagining everything that could possibly have happened and can barely breathe. Whatever your panic spiral is put yourself in his shoes with those fears. Imagine that for your bf the future is his nervous panic attack. He is afraid of everything that could go wrong, so he can't focus on what is going right and will be good. He can only see the mistakes and what ruin they will cause you both. It isn't that he doesn't love you and it isn't that he is afraid of marrying you specifically. It's that thinking about it now makes it too real. He appreciates everything you do, he knows you are great to him, and love him. He just can't think about the future until he's ready, it's too scary. What you can do now that shouldn't be as scary is put a huge number out to lessen it and don't put yourself in the equation. Ask him \"What do you imagine for yourself when you're 80?\" If that's too scary, then figure out what he's focused on now. Is he finishing college, looking for a new job, or just getting used to the one he's in. You can't know plans he doesn't know, and his goals are so far off in his mind, it's as if they don't exist yet. You do a lot already, you know how much you're putting in and want to make sure it's worth the effort. So you love him, and he loves you, but he can't give you what you need right now. Ask yourself, can you wait until he's ready?<BlueWolf2018>: I understand. I\u2019ve been watching a few videos and they all conclude to something similar. I can wait for him to be ready. It would make me happy to know what I\u2019m waiting for though<paradoxium777>: You're waiting for him, as long as you both have love, everything will fall into place.<BlueWolf2018>: I feel bad I failed to look at like that.

How Do I Tell My Family? Fixed formatting and want to confirm I am looking into getting professional assistance later this week. Also sorry for the length, this is such a huge hit that I have to get everything out. Honestly I'm a bit shaken right now and not sure how to properly cope. The past day has really been tough. I am actually looking for advice on two different things: how/if to tell my family and how do I get past this. I think I just need to talk to people I just turned 29 last week and also moved into a new apartment to get closer to work. This was so exciting for me since I previously had an hour commute to work and now it is about 35 minutes. I actually had 2 dates lined up this weekend (Sat &amp; Sun), which I have cancelled/rescheduled due to the past day. Things were actually looking up for me. I've never had luck with women. I'm actually a virgin who only has had one girlfriend in my life. I've also haven't had many friends in my life, just a handful. Last night, I had the urge to actually go out and have some fun. The problem was I don't have friends to actually do that. I texted the few people I know and each came back that they were unable to go out. I should add that I have suffered from severe depression/anxiety for 17 years now. It has been incredibly rough and honestly I don't even know how I am still here. I tried 1 suicide attempt back in 2010 (car parked in garage), but family came home soon after I started the car. During this time, I used sports and gaming as coping mechanisms and overall it has worked well. I've spent hundreds of hours playing WoW and LoL while following every sport imaginable. However, my interest in gaming has gone away basically completely in the past couple weeks. Yesterday at around 7pm after all my friends said they were unable to go out, I had a panic attack, first one in a year. I looked at myself, 29, a year away from 30, no interests in the games I once played, very little friends, never was able to enjoy myself and have a fun time going out and at my age pretty much don't have a chance to do so. I had multiple dates planned, but honestly I don't even know what I'm looking for at this moment that this became just stress to me. I talked myself out of this panic attack, breathed a little bit and after an hour or so, was \"ok\". It's been something I've had to deal with for 17 years now, I knew the routine. However after about an hour, I started to analyze the situation and try to figure out why this has happened. How is it I came to arrive here? This is where the repressed memory came up. The memory actually came back to me last year (last panic attack) when I was watching a baseball game live in a different state by myself and just reading an article by former NBA player Keyon Dooling about a similar situation. At that time, I thought it was something I could sweep under the rug and not have it affect me going forward. Clearly I was wrong and now I know I need to get it off my chest. It's all a blur since I repressed it so long and I was younger then. Part of me tells myself that it wasn't rape and it wasn't a big deal, just a case of a young kid with hormones playing around. However, I know if I say that, I'm just trivializing it and I know everyone would tell me to not do that and that it was rape. I'm the baby of the family (me, my brother and my sister), so I always have felt a little weak and helpless. This was definitely during age 10-14. My brother would always boss me around. Have me get food for him, get pops for him, do this, do that, etc. And I just went along with it, I like feeling needed and (in a way) important. However, when I was 11/12 and he was 13/14, there were a couple incidents that played a huge role in my life, bigger than I could have possibly imagined until yesterday. Like I said, it was so long ago and I have repressed it so much that I don't know the specific details, but I just remember being in our basement together. I was either looking to do something I wanted or he just used the fact that he was bigger than me to do something. I remember having him tell me to put his penis in my mouth until it was hard (not sure if once or a couple times). I still remember pulling it out and him saying \"it's not hard yet\". He never had sex with me and he never made me \"finish\" him, so I don't know if I can call it rape, but part of me thinks so. When this came back to me, it lit a switch in my head of how I came to be the person I am that I don't like, why it was happening, and I just exploded into tears and haven't been able to stop. I believe it's the reason my depression came about around the same time, why I have never been able to maintain friendships or have a relationship, why I am incredibly shy, why I have never been able to love myself, and why it is happening now due to gaming. I'm just so lost My brother is a huge gamer and I have basically done everything he has done since then in terms of life and gaming and the trigger was my losing interest in gaming and making a decision on my own to not do something my brother does. Also since I moved, this is the first time I am living in a place where my brother hasn't stayed prior. I don't even know who I am as a person and what interests me now. After the situation, my brother was still his bossy self for a couple more years, but got better over time. Like I said, I have suffered from depression for 17 years now with ups and downs. I think once he noticed that, he stopped himself. I know I'll have to tell my family eventually, but my concern is with my brother (I know, I know, my first concern should be me. Not my brother). He has dealt with depression as well for the past 6 or so years as well and came close to killing himself and now he lives in a different state where he knows no one. If I tell my family, I worry that he will kill himself. I am at the point in life in age where I feel I am too old to go out and enjoy myself anymore , but I want to do so since I missed that in my life. I fear that I'll never love myself. I'm just completely lost. How do I tell my family? How do I move on? Tl; dr - My brother sexually assaulted me when we were teens. Repressed it for 17 years causing severe depression and defined who I am. Worried my brother will kill himself if I brought it up, but feel I have to get it off my chest and have no idea how or how to deal with this in my life going forward. <Sockhereye>: Recovered/repressed memories are almost always fake.

In the 80\u2019s there was not just a backlash to the gaslighting regarding abusive, there was a preponderance or therapists engaging in leading questions, and there\u2019s been a ton of research into the power of suggestion and implanting ideas of memory - it\u2019s effective. This person didn\u2019t have anyone trying to \u201cuncover\u201d this memory, they just remember of their own accord. That\u2019s a very different scenario.<Sockhereye>: It is not \"a secondary source article in a magazine\". It is literally the direct conclusion of the American Psychological Association as quoted by its official publication, as my post made clear. &gt;They literally do remember it. The conclusion isn't just applicable to memories recovered with the help of therapists. The conclusion is that there's no evidence that it's possible for a person to completely forget/repress a substantial, traumatic memory and then suddenly have it reemerge.<countryhopping>: You linked to an article in Psychology Today, not the actual peer reviewed article it\u2019s referencing. Thats the literal definition of a secondary source, where instead of presenting actual findings someone writes a story about it for a magazine or similar publication. One quote without the context of the study, many related studies, or general professional consensus is quite the opposite of a clear conclusion. Read the actual article before pontificating on its contents. <Sockhereye>: The particular statement that I quoted from the article is not referencing any study (one is referenced later in the article, but not in relation to the quote I provided), but rather refers to a general statement from the APA finding no evidence overall for *any* repressed memories, not just therapist-elicited ones (which is what it links, only mentioning the study specifically involving therapist-elicited memories much later in the article as a whole). That is, once again, it is literally the direct conclusion of the American Psychological Association on the matter as quoted by its official publication, as my post made clear. I swear to god the smug illiteracy on this site is fucking astounding. Maybe you should read and actually *understand* the article before spewing what you misapprehended its contents as next time, re\u200dtard.<countryhopping>: LOL. You are quite convinced you\u2019re a genius, resort to immediate name calling, &amp; call other people smug. You\u2019re really emotional and need to calm down. It\u2019s magazine publication does not give an in depth analysis of the studies themselves, you haven\u2019t even read them, and you\u2019re trying to armchair diagnose this person based on studies you haven\u2019t read and little understanding of what happened. And you\u2019re taking studies out of context &amp; purpose but go on about how you\u2019re very smart about things you haven\u2019t read. <Sockhereye>: &gt;It\u2019s magazine publication does not give an in depth analysis of the studies themselves That's because, once again per the official conclusion of the American Psychological Association (as quoted, once again, by its official publication, not a mere \"magazine\"), there *are no studies* providing any real solid empirical evidence of repressed memories to analyze. I'm not sure how clear I can make this to your incredibly unintelligent self. There are none of your magic studies that support your viewpoint that have been deemed worth looking at by the most important psychological institution in the world, and therefore your criticisms mean nothing. Are you too stupid to understand that? Do you not know what the APA is? If there were a worthwhile debate on the subject, with studies worth reading on either side, I think they'd know. I'm not trying to diagnose anyone. I'm simply telling them that their proposed diagnosis of themselves, according to the foremost body in the field of psychology, falls outside of the realm of possibility. And yes, by the way, you're still a re\u200dtard.", "num_messages": 10, "avg_score": 5.6}

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9g0n3/i_34m_just_discovered_the_real_side_of_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app So after I went home yesterday, I cooled down a bit and finally collected my guts to call her. I called her, she accepted my call and said \"What?\" I told her \"I'm sorry for overrea...\" and she dropped off the call. I texted her, \"I need the copy of my house keys back, I'm breaking up with you.\" She didn't respond. I got into my car went to her place, knocked at least ten times before storming off. I looked in the parking lot, her car wasn't there. So I texted her \"Where are you?\" ten minutes pass, no response. I drove back home and I noticed her car parked next to my house, I carelessly park my car, run inside the house and there I see her collecting all my shit (my laptop, my iPad...) that's when I tell her \"What are you doing?\" She tells me, \"I'm taking back what's mine.\" That's when I tried to grab the things off her arms before she screamed, \"Get off me.\" She started kicking me and ran out the house. I tell her to give my shit back or I will call the cops, she doesn't react to the warning, so I whip out my phone and dial the cops. She drove off with my: laptop, my work phone and my iPad. Cops arrive roughly 20 minutes later and I told them what happened and I tell them the location of her house. They sent off a cop to her house to collect the electronics. The cops start asking me questions like \"Is this the first time?\"..... 40 minutes later I got my stuff back. She has been put into a cell for eight hours and and she will have to attend court the following week. Now I'm contemplating why life always gives me the shit end of the stick. <Edit>: For everyone questioning of how she got arrested on the same day, she let the cops in and confessed what she has done.<CuckyMcCuckerCuck>: &gt;She has been put into a cell for eight hours and and she will have to attend court the following week.

The top answer is amazing, but you would have to be a fucking idiot not to realise how casually and *rampantly* sexist, transphobic, and racist reddit has become just generally. This is a fucking relationship thread for fucks sake lol and just *look* at it.<jouwhul>: Really?? Is it sexist to say that men commit an overwhelming majority of the violence in this world? Is it sexist to say that police deal with violent men all the time? That showing up to a call and expecting the man to be the aggressor is really truly inconceivable when all the data and all the lived experience of the officers says so, is sexist? So therefore believing the woman over the man and removing the usual physical threat by placing him in jail at worst, or ignoring his complaints at best, is sexist?

Please, help me live.<TL>:DR Been together for a dozen years, always thought he just didn\u2019t enjoy getting off. Incorrect. He prefers porn, almost exclusively. Now that it\u2019s out in the open, he hasn\u2019t made a concerted effort to rekindle our love... He knows I'll never leave because I truly do love the man. &amp;#x200B; I married my husband in 2011, we started dating early 2008. Sex and Intimacy were good in the beginning, no surprise there... but when we moved in together it started to taper off. Our newlywed year (about 2 years later) was still OK but it fell off a cliff shortly after. &amp;#x200B; My fault, right? I let myself go, right? OK, I can fix that\u2026 I lost weight, I was thinner than ever (size 6). Great, this has to work. Nope. He still had practically no interest in me. At the time, he was giving me plenty of love and affection, just very little sex. I came to the conclusion that he just didn\u2019t enjoy getting off. I was getting sweet back rubs every night, kind words every day and little gifts every once in a while... He loved me and it showed. He just didn\u2019t really care for sex. I can handle that. Not gonna lie, it was a bit of poetic justice; I\u2019ve *always* had a high libido. &amp;#x200B; I\u2019ve been living this truth since 2013. I\u2019ve pushed my own desires down so deep that I actually *forgot* about them. I\u2019m not kidding, I\u2019d **FORGOTTON** what my kinks/fantasies are. &amp;#x200B; From the beginning of our marriage, frankly before, I have been a doting partner. I\u2019m a trained chef and make daily meals. I do the laundry, all the shopping, all the cleaning. I don\u2019t buy expensive handbags; I still *happily* drive the car I drove before we were dating. I don\u2019t hold the remote, I don\u2019t ask undue questions. I don\u2019t expect anything in return. I am here for him; mind body and soul. &amp;#x200B; That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t do things for myself, I want to be clear. I have learned how to play piano, started (and failed) a business, built lasting friendships with our neighbors (IRL neighbors)\u2026 Just in the last 2 years. I have a couple of BFFs and a handful of other friends who I interact with on a regular basis. I grow a vegetable garden every year. I acquired a tractor for our land. I host several holiday meals every year... I could go on, you get the point. &amp;#x200B; The level of love and affection I\u2019ve received from him diminished over time until early 2018, when I finally spoke up. I didn\u2019t speak ambiguously, I said things like \u201cI need you to touch my body with your hands every day.\u201d Specific, direct, to the point. He\u2019ll try, he\u2019d say. It\u2019s hard to show affection, he\u2019d say. Ok. Try, that\u2019ll work. He didn\u2019t try. He did tell me that I needed to quit drinking, cut out restaurant dining, never smoke weed... I complied, fully. Enthusiastically; I don't believe I do these things excessively anyway.... He didn't quit drinking, of course. Nor did he assume any responsibility for cooking. I thought his requests/demands of me were silly but I was desperate for his love. I was starving for it. I wasn't even mad at his requests, honestly. I would have done *anything*. Full disclosure, I started to fear I was living with a closeted homosexual. I guess that's the only silver lining here, he's not gay. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f &amp;#x200B; In January of this year I discovered his porn directory. I assumed he watched porn occasionally; I certainly did. I had no idea that it was a daily (throughout-the-day) activity that he would masturbate to it multiple times per week; all but ignoring my needs. When I confronted him, it was my fault. \u201cI used to be ambitious\u201d he said. \u201cI used to be happy.\u201d That\u2019s all well and good, except, when he started this habit I WAS happy and I am STILL ambitious. &amp;#x200B; He\u2019s now admitted that his habit was a betrayal that had real consequences (concerns over brain chemistry, primarily). He\u2019s told me that he\u2019ll \u201ctry to be better\u201d but when I tell him HOW he can be better he ignores it. I send him links to articles, videos (even apps) that can help. I\u2019ve purchased card games that are supposed to foster intimacy. He only reads them if he can\u2019t find ANYTHING else he\u2019d prefer (fast cars, marine vessel tragedies, african swallows). He doesn\u2019t absorb anything in them. He\u2019s declined/ignored my request to play romantic games. &amp;#x200B; He claims he\u2019s trying to do research about how to rebuild trust and show me he loves me but that the only solutions he remembers aren\u2019t helpful. Not helpful how? \u201cYou should break up\u201d or \u201csome marriages only have sex once every 3 years.\u201d I have a hard time understanding how a search query on how to reconcile a betrayal renders such results. He\u2019s searching for exoneration instead of accepting responsibility. That\u2019s the only answer. &amp;#x200B; I can\u2019t see living without him but he\u2019s just not that into me, is he? I\u2019m 37, FML.<The_411>: So he says... trust but verify. It is unfortunate that things got to this point, because there are lots of men who are single who would pay attention to their significant other and enjoy interacting intimately. That\u2019s the rub. Many people get involved with people fall \u201cin-love\u201d with the version of person that is being portrayed to them and then when the facade crumbles they get stuck because they get paralyzed with fear about being single and dating. Sure dating can be hard but staying and hoping for things to change seems like a bigger long shot.<theoreticallyThrown>: I put all my eggs in this basket. If it falls, I have no more options. I will not date, I will adopt dogs.<typingbonbmybphone>: Can you elaborate a little bit on why?<theoreticallyThrown>: Yes. Because I'm loyal to a fault.<typingbonbmybphone>: Honestly, if I was your therapist, I'd feel like you were deflecting from the real issue. But, I'm not your therapist, so that's very admirable, I hope it works out for you.<grimreapersdtr>: Her partner sounds like a porn addict. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her being upset.<typingbonbmybphone>: I agree, she has every right to be upset about her relationship. I was asking her about \u201cIf it falls, I have no more options. I will not date, I will adopt dogs.\u201d A lot of times we are the architects of our own misery.<theoreticallyThrown>: I can't really explain it beyond loyalty. I took vows and while I could potentially break them to end this marriage, I don't think I could take vows again. That being the case, I wouldn't feel comfortable dating without the goal of marriage. Odd, maybe... possibly inaccurate. Certainly, at first, it would just be lots of one night stands and dogs. I am loyal AF, it's the hand I was dealt.<typingbonbmybphone>: I've spent a lot of time in the /r/deadbedroom community, and one of the things that's hard to grasp there is 'why stay'? It actually makes a lot of sense to me that the reason is \"this is my definition of myself as a person\" - maybe the definition is \"one monogamous marriage\" or \"married to this person\" or \"not giving up on someone I love\", or even \"I live with my mistakes / don't admit my mistakes\". What happened to me, though, is I eventually realized that *I need things*. I need affection, touch, and to feel wanted. For me, I can't be loyal if I can't be me. OP, for you, 'being me' can mean no more relationships, just dogs and the broad social network you seem to have cultivated, and that's great. I guess I would have just imagined that you'd focus less on \"loyalty\" as a reason for dogs and no more romance, and focused more on the \"I'm happy without it\".<theoreticallyThrown>: For clarity, I'm loyal to myself. I took vows, I can't break them twice. I don't even want to break them once....", "num_messages": 11, "avg_score": 2.7272727273}

When I checked one of her friends Snapchat story while they were away I found a short video of my girlfriend kissing one of the other girls at a party. I didn't really like seeing that but I thought nothing of it and I just blamed it on her being drunk. When she came back from the trip I talked to her and told her that it hurt me and I asked her if we could agree on not kissing others and stuff like that (esp. in the way that she did). She agreed reluctantly but told me it's different because it was a girl and a friend and not to overthink it. None the less we agreed on this. Just a couple hours later I received texts from 3 of her friends telling me to stop getting involved and to leave them alone and calling me all sorts of names. &amp;#x200B; Am I missing something here?

The gender doesn't matter it's cheating. Don't allow her to manipulate you in thinking otherwise. Show her the messages her \"friends\" sent you and ask her if she wants to continue being friends with people who don't respect your relationship. Her answer and actions afterwards will show you how much of a priority your relationship is to her.<Rackminster>: It seems to me that the girlfriend took what he said and immediately spun it as some kind of attack on her friends and cried to her friends about it, so her friends jumped in to defend her. Waving the friend's defense of her at her isn't going to solve anything. I think it's more likely that she's young, immature, and unwilling to see reason in personal boundaries. She won't think she did anything wrong, and is resentful of his interference in her good times.<sn00p3r>: If her having a good time means cheating there is no point in continuing this relationship. <EDIT>: Some people are having a hard time understanding this sentence so allow me to paraphrase it: If she has to cheat to have a good time there is no point in continuing this relationship.<Glatzigoblin>: What ? So if she kissed another man and had a good time it would also no be cheating cause it was fun ?

B) If you think just having a good time is cheating, you should end the relationship. I\u2019m pretty confident they meant A.<KittenCrusades>: My interpretation is the same.

Tl;dr: I\u2019ve turned down hookups from a very attractive girl because the timing and situation has been pretty awful every time so far, my sexuality has been questioned, and my closest buddies are giving me shit for it too. So I\u2019ve (20M) been hanging out with an absolute dime piece (20F) the last 2 weeks. We have been in the same nursing class for almost two years now, but in a sea of girls and very few males in the program, we have never ran into each other or talked until about 2 weeks ago as i mentioned. Every time we have hung out, she has made it very clear with body language, things she says, etc. that she really wants to hook up. We get along super well and i really do love hanging out with her. We\u2019ll make out and get handsy, but I don\u2019t let it get past that point mostly because the situations are pretty non-ideal. For example, first night we started talking at a nursing party, she was very drunk, on a whole different level than I was, so I kindly turned down her offer to Uber back to my place. She was very upset and was giving me a lot of shit like I had just done something socially appalling. I\u2019m not very good or super comfortable in new social situations, so this was very uncomfortable for me, but nothing ended up happening that night. She got her Uber home and gave me a ton of grief for it. 3 nights later, I get an \u201csos\u201d text from her at like 2am saying she wants to be picked up from the bars. I said, fuck it, I\u2019m not doing anything and don\u2019t need to be anywhere in the morning so i went and picked her up knowing she would be drunk and definitely wanted to fuck, but I could not do that in a million years and keep a clean conscience no matter how hot she is. We came back to my place for a while and talked and just hung out a little bit, and it was obvious she had an agenda but she was drunk and I was not, so a very bad look for me if anything ensued. She, again, got very offended and asked me if I was gay. Until that night, my sexuality had never been questioned and I really didn\u2019t know what to say. I told her I could either give her a ride home, I could get her an Uber, or she could just spend the night. She said I was \u201ctoo drunk\u201d to drive her home (I had been drinking much earlier in the night, but did not feel any affects from alcohol at this point). She ended up getting an Uber, and totally changed the way she was acting towards me when, in all reality, I just wanted her to get home safe. I confronted her about this the day after and she was extremely apologetic and admitted she was totally in the wrong and that challenging my sexuality just because I said no to her was completely uncalled for. I forgave her and moved on, people make really stupid mistakes while drunk, and it wasn\u2019t the end of the world. She invited me to her friends birthday party (which was last night), and I ended up going and got pretty drunk with her. I had a total blast the whole night meeting all of her friends (who are very cool and nice people) as well as other people at the party. She was making me take shots (i rarely drink hard alcohol, too many awful experiences with it) and do keg stands which was really fun but in the back of my head, i knew she wanted my better judgement to be out of the way for later in the night. We, again, made out a lot and were very handsy but I had shit to do early this morning (7:30am) and it was already really late (2:30am) by the time she was ready to come back to my place. Yes i was drunk, but turned her down again explaining that I had to get up early, and as much and i would love to take her home, the whole situation was not ideal and told her i would walk her home or get her an Uber. She then hit me with \u201care you sure you\u2019re not gay?\u201d I can\u2019t quite figure out what\u2019s so hard for her to take no as an answer without attacking me in response, I\u2019m assuming she never gets turned down as she is extremely attractive. I clarified that I\u2019m certainly not gay, and that i didn\u2019t want to have to deal with leaving a girl in my room in the morning as I had places to be. It was like a switched changed in her head as soon as she found out she wouldn\u2019t be spending the night at my place, and acted extremely salty towards me the for the following 30 minutes we spent at the party, but not without doing some ungodly things to me with her body in effort to change my mind. Long story short, her efforts did not produce the results she was hoping for, I was very sure that I would not be hooking up with her that night. I want to be clear on something, I fully intend to hook up with her when we are both willing and able, and I made sure she knew that, but still, the amount of grief I have been given time and time again when i turn her down is honestly disgusting. I confided in 3 of my closest buddies on the topic telling them that she has questioned my sexuality when I deny her, and I just get called a pussy or some other derogatory term or they say (direct quote) \u201care you sure you\u2019re not gay? I\u2019m just saying, she might not be wrong.\u201d I\u2019m not offended by all this shit I\u2019m getting from everyone around me, I do not feel personally attacked or anything along those lines, I just can\u2019t believe a guy saying no to a girl is so terribly interpreted in this day and age. Honestly I make decisions based on what I want, what i know is right, and what\u2019s good for me and others, and I do not understand why it\u2019s so difficult for people to see that. All the shit has not affected my decision making at all like I\u2019m still going to do what I want and should do, but like i said, I\u2019m perplexed by the ignorance of so many people my age. This whole situation has definitely made me reflect and maybe I am being too \u201cuptight\u201d and not allowing myself the fun that college can provide. What do y\u2019all think? Am I crazy for not accepting these offers to hook up with an extremely hot girl or am I doing the right thing considering the circumstances? Also, I have not yet confronted her about calling me gay a second time, I\u2019m not even sure if she remembers it. How would y\u2019all recommend going about it the second time as I have clearly failed the first time?<LilithMischievous>: Ur not crazy. Stay true to who you are, its completely okay. Men doesnt have to say yes to sex just cause theres a stereotype claiming so. Do ur thing man, fuck what everyone else thinks. As a woman, i dont think uve acted \u201dgay\u201d at all, but her ego is probably hurt as women tend to place alot of their self-worth based on their looks. So you turning her down hurts her/makes her insecure. So the question of u being gay or not sounds like a form of defence whether she is aware of it or not. Ciao.<SummertimeTriangle>: Didn\u2019t think about it that way, it just didn\u2019t cross my mind that she would take it personally because my reasons had nothing to do with how she looks. Oversight on my part, but the way she handled it is still concerning to me. Thanks for the insight, I\u2019ll try to navigate this whole thing will a little more nuance than just her being salty. Thank you!!<LilithMischievous>: No worries, best of luck :)", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 2.5}

When confronted, my girlfriend denies everything, but I know she is lying. &amp;#x200B; <Backstory>: My girlfriend, Ariel, and I have been together for almost two and a half years. We are both 22 and full time university students at different schools. In addition to school, I work full time, while she works part time. We both have social lives with connected friend groups. Despite both of our busy schedules, we always make time to see each other twice a week or talk once a day. Therefore the time we spend together, even with friends is really important to use. As we do not see each other as much as we would like too, trust is a big thing in our relationship. I trust that Ariel does not hide things from me and lie to me when we talk to each other. Now for the problem; two week ago, I was done with all of my mid-terms and all of my assignments. For the first time in a month I had a free Friday night where I could do what ever I wanted. I decided that I wanted to relax, smoke a joint and paint some Bob Ross., a perfect night. So I contacted my two stoner friends and my girlfriend to see if they wanted to join me. Unfortunately, both my girlfriend and my first friend was unable to because of work, but my second friend was. Let's call her Marie. Marie and I have been close friends for three years and is also close friends with Ariel. They have never had a problem and really liked each other. On Wednesday, Marie and I had our night planned. I would go to her house, smoke, paint and then watch the flat earth documentary on Netflix. I once again invited my girlfriend and asked her if she wanted to come, never hiding anything from her. Ariel told me once again that she could not and even said that it did not bother her that I was going alone. Cut to Friday, I show up at Marie's house. We eat, admire Bob Ross's skills and watch the documentary, all while high a kite. I pass out on the couch while Marie goes to sleep in her room. In the morning when I wake up, I am bombarded by a wall of text from my girlfriend asking where I was, who I was with, etc... Imagine the interrogation in the movie; The Dark Knight, with the joker, but worst. I immediately call her and explain where I was. She starts screaming at me saying that I am irresponsible and what I did last night was stupid. She believes I cheater on her and that I am hiding something from her. We spend an hours on the phone and I explain everything and assure her that nothing happened. Initially I assumed it was the stress of school that made her snap, so I let it go and told her that I would never sleep at Marie's house again. I apologize, get ready for work and leave it there. The next time we saw each other the subject popped up again. She didn't believe me that nothing happened.To prove to her I did not cheat, I showed her my text between Marie and I. (Just for context, I am clean as whistle, I can't even cheat on a test, yet alone my girlfriend). I explained to Ariel that she should trust me because I trust her. I was being completely open about the whole situation and never once lied or hid anything from her. I even told her that as a couple, we have to trust each other and not hide things from each other. She told me that she did trust me and that she over reacted and she too, would never react the same way again. With-in the day, I had already forgotten about our little fight and I thought it was the end of it. Now this is where the story gets weird, last night after class, I went to a bar with a group of school friends. At the bar, I saw Marie. So we talked caught up on what had happened in the last two weeks, and I could see something was not right. As I start questioning her, she tells me that the previous Monday, a week after my fight with Ariel, Ariel contacted Marie. She wanted to meet up with Marie and clear the air with what had happened. They go have lunch. When Marie goes to the bathroom, she leaves her phone on the table. When she comes back, Ariel is trying to get into said phone. When Marie sits back down, Ariel demands and \"commands\" her to open her phone so that she could read the conversation between Marie and I. Marie being scarred obliges and waits patiently while my girlfriend searches her phone. Then my girlfriend starts interrogating her and accusing her of deleting text between the two of us. At this point Marie had enough so she took her phone back, paid her bill and let. When I find this out I immediately apologize to Marie and say that I am sorry that she was put in the middle of this mess. I call my girlfriend to ask her if the story was true. As soon as I start asking questions, Ariel becomes extremely defensive and dismissive. She says that the catch up lunch never happened and that Marie is lying. But I know for a fact that the lunch happened because Marie showed me the conversation to organised the lunch. So my girlfriend is 100% lying to me and has completely ruin the trust I had with her and I really do not know if I will be able to regain that trust. &amp;#x200B; So here is my question, What should I do? I am completely torn. On the one had if i confront my girlfriend again she will once again be dismissive and lie to my face. If I do not talk to her about it and forget about everything, I would not be able to trust her anymore, which is a complete deal breaker for me. I tried everything to show her that I am honest with her and yet, she keeps lying to me. I have never once cheated on her or even thought about it. I am really confused and I do not know what to do. I have already been in a relationship with no trust and I really do not want it to happen again. &amp;#x200B;<wtfthecanuck>: Flip this back at her, how would she advise a friend whose SO had acted so poorly with a friend and then lied about it. <funkypotatoman>: I would prabably tell them to talk about it and try to work it out. <wtfthecanuck>: Not what you would say. But look her in the eye and ask her how she would act. Right now, it seems she's just batshit crazy", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 1.25}

You don't have a friend in her. She is manipulating you to stay with her. This is a toxic friendship. She is the one who needs help not you. She keeps going behind your back and breaking your trust. When you tried to end things, she manipulated you blaming you for her anxiety. That isn't your fault or responsibility. She needs to know how to take care of herself and not blame you for something that isn't your fault. I am so sorry you were assaulted, I hope you are doing okay. If you haven't seen a therapist I strongly recommend one, even if you don't think you need one. It helps to process things better and vent out issues without worrying they'll tell someone else. Patient privilege they won't. I strongly recommend cutting all ties and communication with this \"friend\" and finding friends who actually care about you enough to keep your secrets.<usernametakenzzz>: Thank you!

It was so awkward. She still wouldn't look at me. I finally got her to open up. I apologized to her for having seen what she saw. I asked her what she thinks she saw...... all she asked was why was BF hurting me?. I explained that BF and I were just wrestling and I was upset that I lost. Then she goes to ask why was I screaming then? (I was wishing lightening would strike me). I told her that I was mad cause I was losing. She bought it.. THANK GOD. Poor thing got freaked out because she thought BF was hurting me. I texted him and asked him to call me and apologize to me for 'hurting' me. He did and I put on speaker phone and he apologized. She felt so much better after that. She was back to her self again after that. We finished the movie and I gave her cough syrup and put her to bed. Disaster avoided! I did call and tell my parents. They were shocked. I haven't come out to them yet and they were unaware that my 'friend' was actually my BF that I've been seeing for a year. As for the sex part.... before they could yell, I apologized and promised them it won't happen again. AND I reminded them of the time I came home from school when I was 16 and caught them in the act on the kitchen island. That got me out of trouble. I wasn't grounded or noting. They did ask if they could meet him sometime next week (he also wants to apologize to them). Today was a good day. Saved my sister's childhood, came out to my parents, had sex- got caught and didn't get in trouble , and parents want to meet my BF. Lesson learned.
