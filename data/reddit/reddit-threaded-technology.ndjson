It popped up again as I went to upload this screenshot to Imgur, and it broke the site.<sime_vidas>: Switching to HTTPS should make it go away. Reddit supports it: https://reddit.com.<FriendlyDespot>: Yeah, this is a screenshot from my wife's computer. I use HTTPS on mine. On my computer I get the popups in embedded browsers that connect with HTTP by default, which breaks a bunch of applications and launchers in a bad way. I'm less interested in circumventing it than I am in having Comcast stop this practice. It's akin to having the USPS open your letters and insert service notices for mail delivery into your envelopes. It's totally improper.<ryankearney>: &gt; It's akin to having the USPS open your letters and insert service notices for mail delivery into your envelopes. Not quite. It's like USPS reading the back of a post card and then writing something on it before delivering it. If you don't want Comcast reading the back of your postcards then put them in an envelope (HTTPS) <FriendlyDespot>: I strongly disagree with that analogy. In order to inject code into passing HTML traffic you have to deencapsulate, inspect, modify, and retransmit. It's a deliberate action of opening the packet and modifying the content. HTTPS just makes the content inside the envelope encrypted, but they're peering into envelopes either way. You can't casually inspect and modify traffic like you can casually glance at a postcard.<happyscrappy>: I don't agree at all. Having a computer alter the stream is far more casual than even glancing at a postcard. It requires no effort or attention at all, it just happens if you programmed the computer to do so. And I don't think he was saying that you're not \"opening the packets\". He's saying the packets don't constitute an envelope. They're not meant to hide anything like an envelope does, they just carry a bite-sized portion of data and have a little space at the front to record the destination address. Thus a packet is more like a postcard than an envelope.<FriendlyDespot>: The USPS could build a machine that automatically opens your envelopes, censors or modifies the content of your mail, and reseals the envelope. It'd require no effort or attention at all by the same criteria that DPI and traffic modification requires no effort or attention at all. I think we can both agree that it certainly isn't \"far more casual than even glancing at a postcard.\" &gt;And I don't think he was saying that you're not \"opening the packets\". He's saying the packets don't constitute an envelope. They're not meant to hide anything like an envelope does, they just carry a bite-sized portion of data and have a little space at the front to record the destination address. Thus a packet is more like a postcard than an envelope. Packets most certainly constitute an envelope. Envelopes in letter mail are used to ensure the integrity of the articles, to affix addressing, and to provide some casual protection from prying eyes. Packets in IP networking are used to ensure the integrity of the data, to affix addressing, and to provide some casual protection from prying eyes by virtue of the fact that it's impossible for a third party to accidentally observe the contents. The postcard analogy fails here because the normal mechanism in a network when transferring a packet is for intermediate hops to receive the packet, look up routing information, affix new layer 2 headers, and send it on its way. In order to modify the contents of the packet that packet has to be received, it has to be deencapsulated, the content has to be reconstituted, the content has to be changed, a new packet has to be built, and that packet has to be retransmitted with fake headers. It is in every way analogous to opening an envelope, modifying the mail content, putting it in a new envelope, and sending it to the recipient with a return address of the original sender.<happyscrappy>: &gt; The USPS could build a machine that automatically opens your envelopes, censors or modifies the content of your mail, and reseals the envelope. It'd require no effort or attention at all by the same criteria that DPI and traffic modification requires no effort or attention at all. I think we can both agree that it certainly isn't \"far more casual than even glancing at a postcard.\" You're talking about building the machine and comparing that to the glance. I'm talking about the glance. If you want to talk about building machines, then writing a program is not comparable to building a machine and putting one in every post office. Writing a program is far easier and deploying the program is trivial unlike building hundreds of copies of a machine. So your analogy falls flat. &gt; Packets most certainly constitute an envelope. Nope. And I explained how in this case they don't. &gt; and to provide some casual protection from prying eyes by virtue Nope. Nothing of the sort. They are only for transport (i.e. addressing). They were never meant to hide the contents. Ever. &gt; a new packet has to be built, and that packet has to be retransmitted with fake headers There's nothing fake about the headers. &gt; It is in every way analogous to opening an envelope Except that a packet isn't analogous to an envelope. So there's no envelope to open. you're opening the packet, but a packet simply never was meant to provide any protection from prying eyes unlike an envelope. &gt; sending it to the recipient with a return address of the original sender The return address is on the *outside* of the envelope. You don't have to open an envelope to change it, inspect it, generate a new one or replicate one you saw. Your analogy is not apt here either. Your envelope analogy doesn't even really apply to *envelopes*!<FriendlyDespot>: &gt;You're talking about building the machine and comparing that to the glance. I'm talking about the glance. I'm not sure what you mean by \"glance\" here that isn't covered in my post. &gt;If you want to talk about building machines, then writing a program is not comparable to building a machine and putting one in every post office. Writing a program is far easier and deploying the program is trivial unlike building hundreds of copies of a machine. So your analogy falls flat. We're talking about putting DPI-capable devices at central offices and running traffic through them, just like you'd have to put a mail inspecting machine at central sorting facilities and run mail through them. My analogy doesn't fall flat simply because one is a digital process and the other is a mechanical process. The end result is the same - a mechanism is deployed to deliberately intercept and modify your messages. The relative efficiency of tampering with my messages doesn't alleviate the issue that I have with the tampering of with my messages. &gt;Nope. And I explained how in this case they don't. ? Yes, and I explained how in this case they do. &gt;Nope. Nothing of the sort. They are only for transport (i.e. addressing). They were never meant to hide the contents. Ever. Yes. You can't just cut off the end of the sentence and pretend that it doesn't exist. Packets provide implicit casual protection because the network is built on a standard that doesn't allow for intermediate systems to inspect them without taking deliberate action to do so. Mail envelopes work the exact same way - the mail system is built on a standard that doesn't allow intermediates to inspect mail without taking deliberate action to do so. The contents of an IP packet is only hidden until it's opened, just as the contents of a mail envelope is only hidden until it's opened. The only difference here is that the USPS and the law respects the privacy of your envelopes and your right to not have them opened, whereas Comcast and the law doesn't respect the privacy of your packets and your right to not have them opened. &gt;There's nothing fake about the headers. Yes there is. You have a system generating a packet, and affixing a source address of another system. That's the definition of fake. &gt;The return address is on the outside of the envelope. You don't have to open an envelope to change it, inspect it, generate a new one or replicate one you saw. Your analogy is not apt here either. What? You're saying that you don't have to open an envelope to change the contents of the mail inside it? How are you going to achieve that? My analogy works just fine. I've been in the networking industry for coming on a decade, I've worked service provider, and I've worked directly with DPI system trials. I've had these discussions with many people in the industry, and many people who manufacture these systems. There's very little disagreement with the envelope analogy amongst those who work in these environments and understand the nature of them.<happyscrappy>: &gt; We're talking about putting DPI-capable devices at central offices and running traffic through them Comcast already has equipment at their offices. This would be modifying how they operate. &gt; The relative efficiency of tampering with my messages doesn't alleviate the issue that I have with the tampering of with my messages. This discussion isn't about how you feel about it. &gt; ? Yes, and I explained how in this case they do. Yes. And I explained how you were wrong. In general and in specifics. So nope packets do not constitute an envelope. &gt; Yes. You can't just cut off the end of the sentence and pretend that it doesn't exist. Packets provide implicit casual protection because the network is built on a standard that doesn't allow for intermediate systems to inspect them without taking deliberate action to do so. No. This is not the case. The packets hide nothing at all from anyone who is conveying them. Packets have never been meant to hide the contents. Ever. &gt; The contents of an IP packet is only hidden until it's opened, just as the contents of a mail envelope is only hidden until it's opened. No. Every machine which conveys it sees the contents. Nothing is hidden. And other machines might see it too if they happen to be on the same subnet that the packet is going down. &gt; Yes there is. You have a system generating a packet, and affixing a source address of another system. That's the definition of fake. No. That's not fake. It's a real header. It just isn't what you would like to see put on. You want to call it misleading? Okay. But it is in no way fake. It is a real, honest-to-god header. Not fake. &gt; You're saying that you don't have to open an envelope to change the contents of the mail inside it? No. Not at all. Again, the return address is not inside, it's on the outside. &gt; I've been in the networking industry for coming on a decade, I've worked service provider, and I've worked directly with DPI system trials. I've had these discussions with many people in the industry, and many people who manufacture these systems. There's very little disagreement with the envelope analogy amongst those who work in these environments and understand the nature of them. Oh please. Tell me all about it. I love to hear your stories about how impressed you are with yourself. <http>://www.webmonkey.com/2011/04/eff-wants-to-secure-the-web-with-https-now-campaign/<FriendlyDespot>: &gt; Comcast already has equipment at their offices. This would be modifying how they operate. Comcast did not have DPI hardware before they decided to do DPI. Those machines are purpose-specific and built to handle one task very well. Not that it even matters to the topic at hand, because by your argument here the USPS could modify their mail sorting machines to peer into envelopes and it'd be A-OK. &gt;This discussion isn't about how you feel about it. No, but you seem to argue that the expediency of the intrusion matters, which is not the case. &gt;Yes. And I explained how you were wrong. In general and in specifics. So nope packets do not constitute an envelope. &gt;No. This is not the case. The packets hide nothing at all from anyone who is conveying them. Packets have never been meant to hide the contents. Ever. I'm going to just stop this here. I consider packets to constitute envelopes in this analogy. I consider your arguments to be wrong, and your reasoning to be poor. Your arguments don't get more compelling by telling me how right you think they are. &gt;No. Every machine which conveys it sees the contents. Nothing is hidden. And other machines might see it too if they happen to be on the same subnet that the packet is going down. Every machine does not see the content. Every machine stores the content in memory, just as every post office stores envelopes in their sorting rooms. Storing is different from inspecting. Machines on the same subnet as the receiving host must take a deliberate action to inspect traffic they incidentally receive that isn't intended for them. The normal behaviour of the network is for those machines to discard that traffic immediately. Just as the normal behaviour for a mail recipient is to not open envelopes in their possession that aren't addressed to them. &gt;No. That's not fake. It's a real header. It just isn't what you would like to see put on. You want to call it misleading? Okay. But it is in no way fake. It is a real, honest-to-god header. Not fake. What kind of juvenile semantic is this? An IP header identifies the source system and the destination system. When a system generates a packet and identifies a source address other than its own, then that header is fake. The industry standard term for headers generated with inaccurate information is You can call it whatever you like, but unless you can actually argue against the point then I have no interest in whatever nomenclature you want to use. &gt;No. Not at all. Again, the return address is not inside, it's on the outside. I'm not really sure I follow what point you're trying to make here, because what you're saying has no bearing on what I'm talking about. &gt;Oh please. Tell me all about it. I love to hear your stories about how impressed you are with yourself. I'm giving you some background on where I'm coming from and what experience I have to back up my comments. If you don't have a similar background, then that's fine. Just say so. No need to get cranky and lash out. &gt;http://www.webmonkey.com/2011/04/eff-wants-to-secure-the-web-with-https-now-campaign/ I'm sure that Scott Gilbertson who reviews mobile devices, software, and cameras at Wired is a very credible authority on networking analogies, and it seems reasonable to ignore all of the examples of IP packets literally being explained as letters in a postal system in all of the technical literature that I'm sure you've read. To avoid having you take us further down absurd and meaningless tangents, let's consider the actual circumstances: 1) Encryption prevents unintended recipients from interpreting the message. 2) Envelopes do not prevent unintended recipients from interpreting the message. Envelopes work as a privacy barrier to those who respect that privacy, not as a mechanism to prevent people intent on reading the message within from doing so. 3) Encryption works whether on a postcard or in an envelope. It doesn't care how it's transported, only how it's decrypted. That very obviously lets you conclude that encryption is not to envelopes as cleartext is to postcards. Encryption and cleartext are concepts that apply both to digital and analogue messages, so we don't really even need analogies to determine how encryption fits into things. Encryption is an aspect of the message, not an aspect of the delivery of that message.<happyscrappy>: &gt; Comcast did not have DPI hardware before they decided to do DPI. Please, tell me more about how Comcast didn't have equipment capable of DPI before this. <http>://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/11/eff-study-reveals-evidence-of-comcasts-bittorrent-interference/ &gt; Every machine does not see the content. Every machine stores the content in memory, just as every post office stores envelopes in their sorting rooms. Storing is different from inspecting. You can look at an envelope and not see what is inside it. This is not the case for a packet. The equipment which forwards these packets see what is inside them. Perhaps they forget it immediately afterward. Or perhaps not. But unlike the USPS with envelopes, they do not forward them without seeing what's inside. &gt; Machines on the same subnet as the receiving host must take a deliberate action to inspect traffic they incidentally receive that isn't intended for them. That's an accident of implementation. Modern hardware uses level 2 address discrimination to save the host processor the trouble of seeing packets which aren't for that host. But this is not a design of the protocol and it's not inherent. You can have a host where every packet on its wire is forward to the host processor and simply ignored if it isn't interested in the packet. And in fact this was how systems worked when IP was designed. Thus, as I said, the packets (and addressing) were never designed at all to hide the contents of packets from inspection, whether casual or intensive. And of course none of this applies to packet forwarding machines since they cannot forward a packet they ignore. &gt; What kind of juvenile semantic is this? I fail to see what you mean. &gt; An IP header identifies the source system and the destination system. An IP header enables routing. There's no guarantee that the from address tracks back to anything. The main reason to do so would if you expected a reply. DHCP packets are not in any way \"fake\" because they do not have source addresses which lead back to host which sent them. They have addresses which enable whatever routing is needed. Sometimes that means they fail to have a source address or destination address or both. &gt; I'm giving you some background on where I'm coming from and what experience I have to back up my comments. If you don't have a similar background, then that's fine. Just say so. No need to get cranky and lash out. I don't give out personal information (such as what I do) to win internet arguments. I don't brag about or disclose my background. If what it takes for you to take me seriously is for me to disclose personal information to impress you then rest assured you will not find yourself taking me seriously because I will simply not be going there. And similarly I am not impressed when someone else tries to quote their credentials to win an argument. &gt; Not that it even matters to the topic at hand, because by your argument here the USPS could modify their mail sorting machines to peer into envelopes and it'd be A-OK. This discussion isn't about OK or not OK. It isn't about how you feel about it or I feel about it. It's about whether a packet is like an envelope or a postcard. Are you having trouble understanding what we're discussing? &gt; I'm sure that Scott Gilbertson who reviews mobile devices, software, and cameras at Wired is a very credible authority on networking analogies, and it seems reasonable to ignore all of the examples of IP packets literally being explained as letters in a postal system in all of the technical literature that I'm sure you've read. Thank God. I was afraid you weren't going to explain to me how much better you are than others in your response. My fears are now allayed. For your next trick, please tell me how you are better at this internet stuff than Vint Cerf. <http>://www.netlingo.com/more/cerfart.php 'Internet Protocol packets are just like postcards'<FriendlyDespot>: &gt;Please, tell me more about how Comcast didn't have equipment capable of DPI before this. &gt;http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/11/eff-study-reveals-evidence-of-comcasts-bittorrent-interference/ You're showing me an article about Comcast doing DPI, and you're saying that it's evidence that Comcast did DPI before implementing the hardware to do DPI.

The equipment which forwards these packets see what is inside them. Perhaps they forget it immediately afterward. Or perhaps not. But unlike the USPS with envelopes, they do not forward them without seeing what's inside. You seem to be stuck in this odd mindset where you can't separate the circumstance of having data in your possession with the circumstance of interpreting and inspecting it. The equipment does not by default \"see\" what's inside a packet in transit by virtue of having that packet in its memory any more than a postal worker \"sees\" what's in a letter that's in the back of his truck. No regular forwarding device will \"see\" what's inside the packet. It will check the layer 2 headers to confirm that it's the intended layer 2 recipient, check the layer 3 headers against its routing table, and then wrap the entire layer 3 packet in a new frame and send it out the egress interface with absolutely *no* respect to the contents of the message. The payload has transited the router, but the router has made *no* observations about the nature of the message. Just as a letter transits a postal truck without the driver making any observations about the nature of the message. Observing the message in the forwarding device is possible with a little deliberate effort from the system operator. Observing the message in the envelope is possible with a little deliberate effort from the postal worker. Simply having the data in its memory does not make a router \"see\" what's inside any more than having a frame signaled across wire pairs makes the cable \"see\" what's inside. &gt;That's an accident of implementation. Modern hardware uses level 2 address discrimination to save the host processor the trouble of seeing packets which aren't for that host. But this is not a design of the protocol and it's not inherent. You can have a host where every packet on its wire is forward to the host processor and simply ignored if it isn't interested in the packet. And in fact this was how systems worked when IP was designed. Thus, as I said, the packets (and addressing) were never designed at all to hide the contents of packets from inspection, whether casual or intensive. This is not an accident of implementation - this is core to the Ethernet specifications. Frames historically hit the CPU because layer 2 functions were originally performed by the CPU. Those functions today are hardware-offloaded, but the functionality is exactly the same, and intended in exactly the same way. Whether it's your CPU or an embedded function of your network controller that does layer 2 address lookups, in the end, the specifications call for Ethernet hosts to discard frames that are not addressed to them instead of sending them to higher layer functions. They're meant to be discarded because the message isn't intended for you, and you aren't supposed to inspect the message. &gt;And of course none of this applies to packet forwarding machines since they cannot forward a packet they ignore. You were talking about end-hosts on the same network, not packet forwarding machines. Keep your arguments straight. &gt;I fail to see what you mean. I'm sure you do. &gt;An IP header enables routing. There's no guarantee that the from address tracks back to anything. The main reason to do so would if you expected a reply. DHCP packets are not in any way \"fake\" because they do not have source addresses which lead back to host which sent them. They have addresses which enable whatever routing is needed. Sometimes that means they fail to have a source address or destination address or both. [RFC 791](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791#section-3.2) clearly states that the source IP address *must* belong to the system originating the packet. If you're doing anything else, then you're spoofing the source address. It's very cut and dry. DHCP messages from hosts with no IP addresses come from source address 0.0.0.0. That's not a spoofed address, because the source simply does not have an IP address at this point, so the field isn't populated. This behaviour is standardised in [RFC1122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#section-3.2.1.3) section 3.2.1.3. The destination address in this case will be 255.255.255.255, which is a valid destination IP address that network stacks by default listen to, just as they do to their local broadcast address, and their local unicast addresses. &gt;I don't give out personal information (such as what I do) to win internet arguments. I don't brag about or disclose my background. If what it takes for you to take me seriously is for me to disclose personal information to impress you then rest assured you will not find yourself taking me seriously because I will simply not be going there. &gt;And similarly I am not impressed when someone else tries to quote their credentials to win an argument. I'm telling you what my personal experiences in the industry are to give you an understanding of where I derive what I'm saying from. Perhaps you have other experiences that you could share to shine light on where you get your ideas from. Instead you get hostile and start insulting me. That's not healthy. It's alarming to me that you think that I'm disclosing anything to \"win\" an argument. I've been arguing on the merits, and the merits speak in my favour. I have no need to appeal to anything else. All I need from you to take you seriously is a consistent and reasonable argument. &gt;This discussion isn't about OK or not OK. It isn't about how you feel about it or I feel about it. It's about whether a packet is like an envelope or a postcard. Are you having trouble understanding what we're discussing? I think you're having trouble. You're setting the standard for inspection by the efficacy of the implementation. You're saying that the difference between inspecting mail letters and IP packets comes down to the nature of the implementation, you're saying that inspecting IP packets is not akin to opening letters because all you need is to adapt on existing systems to enable the functionality, and I'm showing you that by those criteria the USPS could adapt their existing mail sorting systems to open envelopes and by your reasoning that wouldn't be akin to opening envelopes. I'm pointing out how flawed the foundation of your argument is. You need to step back and reevaluate if you can't understand that. &gt;Thank God. I was afraid you weren't going to explain to me how much better you are than others in your response. My fears are now allayed. Why are you making this about me? I'm referring to industry standard technical literature for different interpretations, not to myself. If you want to cite someone, at least cite someone who has credible involvement in whatever you're citing. &gt;For your next trick, please tell me how you are better at this internet stuff than Vint Cerf. &gt;http://www.netlingo.com/more/cerfart.php &gt;'Internet Protocol packets are just like postcards' If you had actually read this article instead of googling the term and picking the first link to paste, you would understand that what Vint Cerf is talking about here is TCP payload segmentation. He's talking about \"cutting up a novel and sending the pages on postcards,\" and packets arriving out of order or not at all. Not once here is the word \"envelope\" mentioned as an alternative to \"postcards,\" because it's not his topic of discussion, and for the purpose of explaining TCP segmentation there's no functional difference between a postcard analogy or an envelope analogy, whether cleartext or encrypted. The argument at hand here is whether IP packets are more like envelopes or postcards with respect to inspection of the message, so if you're going to cite other sources, you should try to cite sources that actually address that distinction. For someone who complains about appeal to authority, you certainly are quick to appeal to Vint Cerf's authority without even understanding what it is that he's talking about. Let's try that logic exercise again and see how you fare: &gt;1) Encryption prevents unintended recipients from interpreting the message. &gt;2) Envelopes do not prevent unintended recipients from interpreting the message. Envelopes work as a privacy barrier to those who respect that privacy, not as a mechanism to prevent people intent on reading the message within from doing so. &gt;3) Encryption works whether on a postcard or in an envelope.

Comcast were doing DPI because they had implemented the hardware to do DPI. Yeah a while ago. Hence putting in this message doesn't require putting in equipment, just a new program. &gt; The equipment does not by default \"see\" what's inside a packet in transit by virtue of having that packet in its memory any more than a postal worker \"sees\" what's in a letter that's in the back of his truck. For the purposes of security, yes it does. If it goes into memory in the system, then you have to assume they \"saw\" it, even by your definition. It's not the same as an unopened envelope being delivered where only the addressing is seen. &gt; No regular forwarding device will \"see\" what's inside the packet. If every forwarding device was operating \"regularly\" then we wouldn't have to worry about security, would we? &gt; If you're doing anything else, then you're spoofing the source address. It's very cut and dry. Or doing NAT. It's not cut and dry as you're taking to make it out to be. &gt; Perhaps you have other experiences that you could share to shine light on where you get your ideas from. Instead you get hostile and start insulting me. That's not healthy. The problem isn't that I'm not communicating info and experiences, the issue is you are trying to play a credential game, threatening to discount what I say unless I explain my bona fides. Again, rest assured if this is what it will take to satisfy you, you will not be satisfied. In return, I am not making an appeal to authority with you. I'm not requesting nor interested in your bona fides. &gt; I've been arguing on the merits, and the merits speak in my favour. I have no need to appeal to anything else. All I need from you to take you seriously is a consistent and reasonable argument. No, the merits don't speak in your favour. And no the problem lacking here is not a consistent argument from me. You're just begging the question, stating that the issue here is essentially that you are right and I am wrong. It's not that simple. &gt; you're saying that inspecting IP packets is not akin to opening letters because all you need is to adapt on existing systems to enable the functionality No, I'm saying that sending an IP packet is not akin to sending a letter. It's akin to sending a postcard, because you must have the expectation that anyone involved in your delivery can see your message without any significant effort and without you ever finding out. &gt; I'm showing you that by those criteria the USPS could adapt their existing mail sorting systems to open envelopes and by your reasoning that wouldn't be akin to opening envelopes. I said no such thing. I didn't talk about adapting equipment to opening envelopes (and resealing them) except the difficulty of doing so, which is harder than an ISP deploying a new rule on the equipment it already has. &gt; If you had actually read this article instead of googling the term and picking the first link to paste Don't act like you know me. And if you can, do yourself the favor by taking your opposite with the same seriousness you take yourself. You can read the article, you know I can read the article. If you just pretend like I can't and didn't read it you're only kidding yourself. &gt; Not once here is the word \"envelope\" mentioned as an alternative to \"postcards,\" ... you should try to cite sources that actually address that distinction. Fair enough. It was a cheap shot. I was being a dick about it because you're being a dick about authority. I was entranced by the name more than the totality of the message. But you know what? At some point you have to take over or just admit to yourself that you aren't interested in the discussion at all. It's not a hard thing to look up. <https>://www.comodo.com/news/press_releases/17_02_09.html <https>://books.google.com/books?id=50maN7VmpusC&amp;pg=PT304&amp;lpg=PT304#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false (Yes, I'm aware this leads back to the Cerf postcard comment, but it also expands upon it in the relevant fashion about being easy to read.) &gt; For someone who complains about appeal to authority, you certainly are quick to appeal to Vint Cerf's authority without even understanding what it is that he's talking about. It was a straight rebuttal to your comment: &gt; There's very little disagreement with the envelope analogy amongst those who work in these environments and understand the nature of them. If you make a comment about what authorities say, then it is impossible for me to attempt to rebut this without discussing what authorities say. So don't try to lay that on me.<FriendlyDespot>: &gt;Yeah a while ago. Hence putting in this message doesn't require putting in equipment, just a new program. What does that have to do with anything? The argument is that DPI hardware needs to be installed to do DPI. Nowhere have I said that they installed DPI hardware specifically for this message, I said that they installed DPI hardware specifically to do DPI. That's why the inspection and modification isn't incidental or casual, but a deliberate effort. &gt;For the purposes of security, yes it does. If it goes into memory in the system, then you have to assume they \"saw\" it, even by your definition. It's not the same as an unopened envelope being delivered where only the addressing is seen. That's funny. Try telling companies that use security envelopes that a regular unopened envelope means that the content hasn't been inspected and observed. Try telling people and organisations that use one-time pads for letter mail that an unopened envelope means that the content hasn't been inspected and observed. For the purpose of security, you have to assume that anything that has left your control has been exposed. For the purpose of privacy or message integrity all you have to do is be able to trust the people who handle your messages. I trust the USPS and their partners by and large to keep my messages private and unaltered, and the law mandates it. I should be able to trust my service provider and their partners to be able to keep my messages private, and the law should mandate it. &gt;If every forwarding device was operating \"regularly\" then we wouldn't have to worry about security, would we? No, we wouldn't. If service providers operated their devices regularly and with respect for user privacy and data integrity, then we wouldn't have to worry about our service providers mangling our data or mining it for information. It sounds like you're arguing that because there are bad people in the world then everyone should be allowed to do bad things. &gt;Or doing NAT. It's not cut and dry as you're taking to make it out to be. Yes, it is that cut and dry, and I think you misunderstand how NAT works. NAT translates internal source addresses that exist on internal hosts to external source addresses that exist on the NAT device. The external source addresses are either assigned to an interface, or to a pool. Those addresses belong to the system, and it will ARP on behalf of them and treat them exactly like any other address with respect to forwarding. When a NAT device rewrites the packet with the external NAT address then it becomes the originating system, and the source address it uses belongs to itself. It fully complies with RFC 791. &gt;The problem isn't that I'm not communicating info and experiences, the issue is you are trying to play a credential game, threatening to discount what I say unless I explain my bona fides. &gt;Again, rest assured if this is what it will take to satisfy you, you will not be satisfied. In return, I am not making an appeal to authority with you. I'm not requesting nor interested in your bona fides. That's odd. I'm explicitly telling you that I'm not playing a credential game, I'm explicitly telling you that I'm not looking for your credentials to judge the merit of your arguments. I'm explicitly saying that the only thing you need to give to satisfy me is a consistent and sensible argument. But here you are repeating this as if you just didn't hear me the first time. &gt;No, the merits don't speak in your favour. And no the problem lacking here is not a consistent argument from me. You're just begging the question, stating that the issue here is essentially that you are right and I am wrong. It's not that simple. I've been arguing the merits from the beginning, and they do favour me. You've been retorting with \"no, because I said so\" several times throughout this conversation, so I think you should do some introspection before throwing those sorts of allegations around. &gt;No, I'm saying that sending an IP packet is not akin to sending a letter. It's akin to sending a postcard, because you must have the expectation that anyone involved in your delivery can see your message without any significant effort and without you ever finding out. And I'm saying that sending an IP packet is like sending a letter, because for someone involved in the delivery to see the message they have to take specific effort to inspect it. Exactly like they'd have to do with a letter. The difference between a postcard and a letter with respect to content is that for a postcard any intermediary can incidentally or accidentally observe the contents in the normal process of forwarding the mail article. Not so with a letter. In IP networking no intermediary can incidentally or accidentally observe the contents in the normal process of forwarding the packet. &gt;I said no such thing. I didn't talk about adapting equipment to opening envelopes (and resealing them) except the difficulty of doing so, which is harder than an ISP deploying a new rule on the equipment it already has. The ISP does not inherently have the equipment to do DPI. They purchase purpose-specific hardware to do that. It also has no implications for the argument at hand. &gt;Don't act like you know me. And if you can, do yourself the favor by taking your opposite with the same seriousness you take yourself. You can read the article, you know I can read the article. If you just pretend like I can't and didn't read it you're only kidding yourself. Oh, my bad. I assumed that when you were so far off the mark from the message of the source that you provided that you simply hadn't read it. &gt;Fair enough. It was a cheap shot. I was being a dick about it because you're being a dick about authority. I was entranced by the name more than the totality of the message. But you know what? At some point you have to take over or just admit to yourself that you aren't interested in the discussion at all. It's not a hard thing to look up. &gt;https://www.comodo.com/news/press_releases/17_02_09.html &gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=50maN7VmpusC&amp;pg=PT304&amp;lpg=PT304#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &gt;(Yes, I'm aware this leads back to the Cerf postcard comment, but it also expands upon it in the relevant fashion about being easy to read.) Sure, there are people out there who would liken it to postcards to instil the notion that unencrypted traffic isn't safe. That's just fine. Unencrypted traffic *isn't* safe. We're not talking about how safe it is to transmit traffic, however, so the analogy doesn't apply in this instance. We're talking about the expectation of privacy and the freedom from having your traffic manipulated. It's illegal for an unauthorised third party to do that, and it's covered by wiretapping and computer crimes laws, and you're essentially saying that because it's possible to inspect (which is also the case for letters) then it's not analogous to a letter despite your intents and expectations for your traffic being identical to what you intend and expect from a letter. You're right that it isn't a hard thing to look up. Browsing through Safari for five minutes brought up the section on interception in chapter 1 of *CompTIA Security+ SY0-401 In Depth* by Mark Ciampa that describes the scenario of interception and inspection with an analogy to letter mail, and examples on pages 36, 37, 93, 103, 133, and 246 in *Computer Security Literacy* by Douglas Jacobson and Joseph Idziorek where IP packets are equated with envelopes. I went over 10 security-related titles and also searched for \"postcard\" and \"post card\" and found nothing. &gt;It was a straight rebuttal to your comment: &gt;If you make a comment about what authorities say, then it is impossible for me to attempt to rebut this without discussing what authorities say. So don't try to lay that on me. There's a difference between appealing to authority and and speaking to majority. What I did was tell you that in my experience there is very little industry disagreement on this. That's not an appeal to authority, that's me telling you that if you're going to stand against the common perception then you need some pretty compelling arguments, because a lot of people arrived at a conclusion different from yours.<happyscrappy>: &gt; There's a difference between appealing to authority and and speaking to majority.

That is some PhD level PR work you're doing there.<yParticle>: Yep! Going public was the correct response to this, which forces them to pay attention and gives the white hat a public paper trail. You had your chance and blew it, Starbucks.<MadTwit>: Eh if you go public your white hat becomes tarnished to a shade of gray. Part of being white hat is reponsible disclosure.<indrion>: I think once the company accuses you of malicious intent when you report it to them you've got the green light to go public without it negatively impacting you. If it takes everybody knowing that their system is broken before they fix it that's not really your problem, if they had just thanked him when he told them initially and fixed it nobody would be any wiser. <the_opinion>: I think that, knowing the consequences of going public with it, and doing so anyway, is malicious by definition. And if you first tried to approach the company quietly before going public, you'd have a job arguing you weren't aware of the consequences of going public.<indrion>: Once the company shuts you down your only two options are to sit back and watch someone else take advantage of the exploit before they fix it, or go public and MAKE them fix it before it's exploited. Which one sounds more like white hat behavior? <the_opinion>: The former. You've made your best efforts to quietly inform them of the problem, it's out of your hands. Life isn't a competition to be the most \"white hat\" you can be.<codeverity>: I disagree. In this case the only loss is on Starbucks side, however often exploits target the average person. In those cases I would say there is an obligation to go public.<the_opinion>: Well, they do say humans are not rational beings, but rational*ising*. Which is what you're doing. <codeverity>: What? This makes no sense. If people are going to get hurt by a company's stubborn inaction, then making it public is the right thing to do. <the_opinion>: \"I have found a vulnerability, and I'm informing people of it so they are not impacted!\" - possibly admirable. \"I have found a vulnerability, and I'm going to tell everyone about it because haha stick it to the stupid corporation and everyone will think I'm great!\" - not so much.<codeverity>: You basically just agreed with me, I said in my first comment that in cases where the public is going to get hurt by an exploit there's an obligation to go public. I was addressing your initial blanket comment that there's no point in going public if the company isn't going to do anything. <the_opinion>: Actually, if you look at my comment it's replying to someone else who was defending *this particular instance* of going public, under the pretence of it being the \"white hat thing to do\". I said, and I still do, that the act is malicious, because it is. The only party that stands to lose is Starbucks, it's basically spite for not being listened to. <codeverity>: If you just mean this particular situation then I agree. Your comment came across as very general so I thought you mean in every situation and not just this one. <the_opinion>: No, clearly there are appropriate times to go public.

I still think Firefox is a better choice than chrome when it comes to privacy, but this is definitely a step in the wrong direction.<emergent_properties>: &gt; The mechanism is quite privacy-conscious As much as sending your browser history, piecemeal, to a third party can be. <It_Was_The_Other_Guy>: Your history is not sent anywhere though. Only things that are gathered are if you pin or click such ad-tile. The browser measures the history locally and then may choose what ad to show you.<emergent_properties>: Do not confuse. If you are being served 'targeted advertising', it means enough of your history was sent to them for you to be targeted. ie If you see a cat advertisement, they know enough of your history to know you like cats. Yes, that absolutely qualifies as 'your history being sent'. Piecemeal. This is only *worse*, because its sample data is your browsing history itself. Not 'you went to petco.com' but specifically you 'looked at these cat collars at these stores'. The bottom line is that this is about the Mozilla company whoring out privacy of the users on the start page to advertisement companies for aggregate dollar. Let's call a spade a spade here...<Vik1ng>: I'm not sure if I understand it correctly, but it doesn't not necessarily have to be the case. &gt; *The browser fetches all available suggested tiles based on country and language from Onyx without using cookies or other user tracking identifiers* So the browser fetches ads for cats, dogs and horses. Then the browser locally looks at your history and sees you visit /r/cats so it shows you the cat ad. Then as far as I understand if you click mozilla tracks that, but *aggregates all Firefox tiles interactions, anonymizing personally identifiable data before sending to Redshift for reporting.* Obviously at some point mozilla still tracks your click, so it's not perfect and I'm not a fan of it, but it does not seem to send your history anywhere. <emergent_properties>: We are arguing about the details of implementation. That is possibly the most pedantic, least important part of the entire thing. The biggest issues of this 'feature': - Third parties will know more about your browsing history (NEW) - Mozilla now has a more direct interest in extracting information from your history (in a 'anonymous' way, whatever that means on the Internet of today) (suddenly privacy is now more convertible to capital). - Firefox is now serving ads directly as if the tab page is a captive portal (NEW) Each of these is its own separate, gosh darn problem. Each one is its own outrage. But as long as we don't lie to ourselves and others: don't call this a feature desired by users of Firefox itself.<Vik1ng>: &gt; Third parties will know more about your browsing history (NEW) Where do they get that data?<emergent_properties>: From the new code Mozilla is adding to Firefox. Specifically, step 1 in their illustration. <BenHurMarcel>: Precisely, it doesn't do that. But of course, if you don't care about the details of the implementation you wouldn't know. <emergent_properties>: &gt; if you don't care about the details of the implementation you wouldn't know It's not a matter of caring, it's a matter of seeing where this fits in the grand scheme of things. And it turns out the bigger picture is \"Firefox is an ad platform\". That is much more concerning than trying to pedantically pick apart a specific implementation. If the ads are targeted, it does, by definition. <Question>: If you visit a lot of cat websites, will these tiles show advertisements for cats? If the answer is yes, then you have to acknowledge that some information is leaked. At this point, I only have to argue about the 'resolution' of this obtained information. It turns out that it doesn't have to explicitly identify a single instance, because remember, the Mozilla server knows what ads it has served you. That is **identity**. The bottom line, however, is that these ads are pulled from a third-party. Pretend to believe this is 'anonymous' if you'd like.<BenHurMarcel>: &gt; If the answer is yes, then you have to acknowledge that some information is leaked No, it's not leaked. The targeting is done locally, by your browser, on your computer. Not on a server. No server gets the data of which ad you're shown. &gt; the Mozilla server knows what ads it has served you. It doesn't, because you download all their ads and your browser, locally, decides which one to show. <emergent_properties>: &gt; It doesn't, because you download all their ads and your browser All their ads? All billion of them? Or more like a small subset, of which the selection criteria itself is identifying? This is a sidetrack discussion. Worse, it's apologistic. The hard truth is: If we are displayed targeted ads, then information is leaking to a third party. **Fundamentally**, advertisements 'based on your browsing history' requires your browsing history. The bigger concern is that Firefox is now a more captive portal for advertisements.<BenHurMarcel>: I'm just correcting your statements based on facts, because you're deforming them. Now, I agree, I'm not happy with the decision, but you shouldn't throw a tantrum based on exaggerations. In the end, we're not funding Mozilla, they give us the software for free. We can comment on it, criticise the software, but it doesn't make sense acting like an entitled customer. <emergent_properties>: &gt; you shouldn't throw a tantrum based on exaggerations. I agree, let's avoid that. Let's not divert our attention on 'exaggerations', whatever that is in this context. Let's instead focus on a simpler, easier to understand truth: Targeted ads 'based on your browsing history' are, in fact, based on your browsing history. And the pull of those ads is, itself, identifying. Because the pulls, even sampled as they are, are still based on browsing history, it is a straightforward task to correlate these pulls with a big enough data set. Any claim of being anonymous is simply wrong.<tardis42>: Quoting directly from the PDF linked earlier ITT. 4. &gt;The browser fetches all available suggested tiles based on country and language from Onyx without using cookies or other user tracking identifiers. 5. &gt;User interactions, such as clicks, pins and blocks, are examples of data that may be measured and processed. View Mozilla\u2019s Privacy Policy or our Data Privacy Principles for more information. 6. &gt;Onyx submits the interaction data to Disco, a restricted access database for large-scale analysis. 7. &gt;Disco aggregates all Firefox tiles interactions, anonymizing personally identifiable data before sending to Redshift for reporting. 8. &gt;Charts and reports are pulled from Redshift using Zenko, a Content Services reporting tool, for analysis by Mozilla. Mozilla sends this report to the partner shortly after the campaign ends. <TL>:DR Yeah, they're sending stuff to (their own) \"Secure\" (Just like Sony) database, namely &gt;User interactions, such as clicks, pins and blocks I.E, NOT your History, only the History of which (Ad) Tiles you've interacted with.

Even if you overlook the problems associated with making non-HTTPS requests and making those over potentially unknown or untrusted carriers, the terms and conditions of the access are being dictated by Facebook. Facebook has backpedaled on what is allowed on the service, and opened it up. But, when I look at this, I see what's essentially an advertising company trying to provide a controlled portal, i.e. AOL-ish, to the outside world. <isik60>: Millions of people only discovered the internet because of AOL. <gryphraff>: True. AOL, however, evolved from a time when there really wasn't the Internet as we know it - they grew into the larger Internet like a vine grows around a tree. While there are some people who still think of AOL as \"The internet,\" the greater portion of control that AOL had is gone. Facebook seems to want to do the exact opposite - build up walls so you only see Facebook approved content, presented through Facebook's portal. It seems Facebook wants these people who have never been online before to think of Facebook as the internet, like AOL users used to think Usenet was an extension of AOL itself. TL;DR: It just ain't good for one man to have that much power. <isik60>: No, they want those people to think of Internet.org as the free part of the internet. They can go outside whenever they like, they just have to pay, as they would have been required to without internet.org. And even inside, facebook is just one of many free sites.<gryphraff>: They can, but Internet.org is being presented to areas that don't really have any other way of getting online.

Capitalism is about free markets. Allowing regulation and reduction of competition through laws is an example of imperfect competition. <http>://thismatter.com/economics/market-models.htm<Indon_Dasani>: &gt; Allowing regulation and reduction of competition through laws is an example of imperfect competition. And this is why Republicans oppose Net Neutrality. Because it's regulation, and they assert it is uncapitalistic as a result. Meanwhile, the 'city regulations' that libertarians so bemoan that prevent the development of new internet utilities? They stem from *property rights*. As it turns out, building a utility network is expensive and involves digging up a lot of roads and yards and such. Property owners, including cities who own roads, do not like this. As property owners, cities are tasked to make their property usable, not perpetually under construction. The best way for them, *in a free market* to let a utility be established is to establish a deal, *a business deal*, with a single provider. These horrible 'city regulations' are contracts. 100% the free market working as intended. It just doesn't work.<Nate1492>: Bullshit :-) Nicely typed, but that's bullshit.<Indon_Dasani>: &gt; Nicely typed, but that's bullshit. I predict you have zero ability to point out anything false or wrong that I said. Because I'm right.<Nate1492>: 1) Republicans oppose Net Neutrality because it would impact their constituents, nothing to do with capitalism. 2) You do not need multiple utility lines dug to have multiple providers. In fact, the current regulations broke that practice up. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System 3) You equate a monopoly situation to 'free market'. Do I really need to describe why that's *insanely fucking stupid* or can you just admit that you typed up some nicely worded, completely asinine, bullshit? You won't, we both know it. You think a free market and a single provider of a server can go hand in hand.<Indon_Dasani>: &gt; 1) Republicans oppose Net Neutrality because it would impact their constituents, nothing to do with capitalism. This is not what Republicans say on the subject. Are you accusing them all of lying? &gt; 2) You do not need multiple utility lines dug to have multiple providers. In fact, the current regulations broke that practice up. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System Doesn't apply to internet service. Also, huge amounts of regulations on telecom have been removed since that antitrust suit. Also, the US has almost stopped filing antitrust suits on monopolies entirely. &gt; 3) You equate a monopoly situation to 'free market'. Contracts that grant effective monopolies happen all the damn time. They were called *trusts*. That's where that word comes from. Governments used to deal with them with things like antitrust lawsuits, but as I noted, they don't anymore, leaving the Free Market to function as it will naturally. &gt; You think a free market and a single provider of a server can go hand in hand. History shows us that without aggressive government intervention, this is *exactly* what happens in a number of industries with high entry barriers and an incentive to perform mergers and acquisitions. You are as ignorant of history, sadly, as you are of law, and as you are of conservative ideology.<Nate1492>: 1) I'm accusing all politicians of hiding their objectives. It's politics, so of course there are many levels of lying involved. 2) Copper, sure, Fiber Ops, it does cover. You most certainly have options if you choose DSL. 3) Trusts are counter free market. Clearly. 4) Free Market and 'Trusts' or 'Monopolies' are antonyms. I don't care how you spin it, I know the history, they arose from exactly what you describe, high barrier situations. But to even *consider that as being free market is sheer idiocy that I will not entertain for another second*. Good day, I can't stand having to describe to an idiot why a monopoly runs counter to free markets. You seriously are fucking stupid if you believe a monopoly is part of the free market concept.<Indon_Dasani>: &gt; 1) I'm accusing all politicians of hiding their objectives. That's fine, but not necessary. Conservative ideology opposes net neutrality out of the box. &gt; 2) Copper, sure, Fiber Ops, it does cover. You most certainly have options if you choose DSL. Regardless of the physical lines, internet service is not legally classified as a common carrier. Though that decision probably had something to do with the proliferation of internet services for pre-DSL phone lines. &gt; 3) Trusts are counter free market. Clearly. The free market makes them. You're welcome to argue that free markets inherently destroy themselves, and that our screwed up telecom situation is a pretty trivial example of that happening and that regulation can correct it, but... ...most free market advocates, like Republicans and the libertarians I was referring to, refuse to believe that. Also you'd basically be validating what I said and adding a, \"But obviously we can fix it,\" which I already know, because I'm not a libertarian.<Nate1492>: The only point I need to make is this: Just because you repeat the same, wrong, point doesn't change the concept that it is wrong. A free market doesn't 'make' trusts. There are attempts to stop free markets, such as trusts, monopolies, and legislation. But honestly, you DO understand the *SIMPLE* concept of a free market, right? You, honestly, do not seem to contemplate this extremely fucking simple concept. &gt;A free market is a market system in which the prices for goods and services are set freely by consent between venders and consumers, in which the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority. <http>://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market The BASIC principle **SPECIFICALLY** talks about how there is **NO MONOPOLY**.. I don't know how I can get through to you, you are really fucking bastardizing the term for your own agenda. Honestly, I want to repeat this so many times until you either stop talking to me or understand this simple concept. Free Market!=Monopoly Free Market!=Monopoly Free Market!=Monopoly Free Market!=Monopoly Free Market!=Monopoly Free Market!=Monopoly Free Market!=Monopoly Free Market!=Monopoly Free Market!=Monopoly Free Market!=Monopoly I don't know how else to approach this. You are 'welcome to argue' any invalid point you want. But you are doing so without the knowledge required to properly discuss the topic. You seem completely reluctant to accept a simple concept of \"Free Markets\" and want to apply your own definition. This is so wrong, it is stopping your further knowledge and understanding. Completely. Wrong. Do you understand? I know I'm being a bit of a dick, but SERIOUSLY you are being so blatantly ignorant I do not know how to discuss any further.<Indon_Dasani>: &gt; A free market doesn't 'make' trusts. There are attempts to stop free markets, such as trusts, monopolies, and legislation. You know one way to use passive voice? To try to be evasive about who and what is doing something. *Actors in a free market* end a free market. *Using the tools a free market encourages them to use*, such as business alliances and buying legislation. And they do so *in accordance with the motives they're expected to pursue in a free market* - personal profit and power. Trusts, monopolies, and corporate-bought legislation are *all* things free markets do. They are also things that end free markets. This is because free markets end themselves. They are inherently unstable. They fail. Every time. I predict you're being evasive because, presumably, you're a libertarian. And because you're a libertarian being honest with yourself, and saying what is true is impossible for you. Admitting *how things work*, and *how things have always worked*, is impossible for you. So you have to make false historical statements, like 'people' do this, implying it's not the people you don't want it to be, and be evasive about how things work, because as a libertarian - you are *compelled* to call the truth bullshit even when you have nothing to follow it up with except for screeching your insane economic faith. You and your ideology will never be able to do anything to improve our internet service. *Progressive Liberalism*, the ideology that brought America the antitrust lawsuit, will - with regulation, such as antitrust lawsuits, common carrier regulations, or, maybe if we're lucky, simply making internet into a municipal public utility with mild privatized elements to boost competitiveness. And doing so will restrict people's property rights. Their rights under a free market. These solutions will prevent a free market, because they will be due to a government authority. And it will produce a market that works instead.<Nate1492>: Your entire premise is based on the idea that a free market supports monopolies. No amount of bullshit, backtracking, or double talk will change this point. Either admit you were wrong that Free Markets can contain monopolies, or I am done talking. I might point out, to my chagrin, that you basically acknowledge that you were wrong, then just carried on speaking. &gt; They are also things that end free markets. So, you basically admit that a free market and a monoply can't co-exist. Then, you ramble on that you think I'm a libertarian, which is just a random personal attack. It's just more bullshit (wrong as well). Anyway, admit you were wrong, or we are done talking. Simple.<Indon_Dasani>: &gt; Your entire premise is based on the idea that a free market supports monopolies. No, it doesn't. It *produces* monopolies. Inevitably. Historically. You can say, \"Oh, they stop being free then!\" and that's fine. Not relevant to anything I'm saying, except to agree with me because, as previously noted, free markets destroy themselves. Because you are broken and incapable of facing reality - regardless of what you call your condition - you are incapable of describing my argument correctly.<Nate1492>: Look, we're done. You can't admit that free market!=monopoly. This is a joke, I've put you on ignore, you are wasting my time.<Indon_Dasani>: &gt; You can't admit that free market!=monopoly. Look. If you try to define your way to being right, then all you can succeed in doing is defining what you're talking about out of reality. This is something libertarians do *all the fucking time*. \"I can't be wrong, because look how I've redefined all the terms involved to prevent myself from ever being wrong!\" But that doesn't make them right. It makes them *delusional*, because now they're no longer capable of talking about things as they actually are. And when you do it, it makes you delusional too.", "num_messages": 19, "avg_score": 270.1578947368}

The third link, [Reset the Net](https://resetthenet.org), is an entire campaign focused around promoting encryption, both on the user side and among web apps and services. That said, the fight against mass surveillance is a culture war. And one of the most public aspects of the government's disregard for our privacy are the BLATANT laws like the PATRIOT Act that straight up say it's okay for them to violate our basic rights. We have a real opportunity right now to put the government on the defensive, explaining to the public why these runaway programs should exist, and build a movement of people who agree that bulk collection of our private data is just not okay. That will lead to more people speaking out and taking action, but also more people encrypting their shit, which makes mass surveillance more difficult and expensive to conduct.<PunishableOffence>: This will not happen, because people are too dumb to tell the difference between Facebook and the internets.<senbei616>: Not dumb, ignorant. There is a world of difference. <Enraiha>: But at some point willful ignorance has to become just \"dumb\". People don't want to understand the internet. Most people just want to load it up and work, just like getting into their car and starting it. They don't want to understand the complexities, just like most things.<senbei616>: Because why would they? People have jobs, kids, demanding social lives, responsibilities, etc. We have made a conscious effort to inject technology in our lives, because we have that luxury. Imagine for a moment you're a 22 year old single mother with student loans, 2 jobs, and a kid. You've only fucked around with a desktop computer a few times in your life and do almost all tech related stuff either on your shitty laptop that constantly freezes up everytime you open up a new tab on chrome or your phone. You get maybe 4 hours everyday to yourself after being mentally and physically exhausted from your daily life. Why the fuck would you give a shit about some techno-bullshit you haven't even heard about, let alone actively start looking into and trying to understand the complexities of this, once again, techno-bullshit you haven't even heard about? Most people don't utilize technology the way we do. Reddit and most technology forums have kind of placed themselves into bubbles where they seem relevant on a major scale. But understand this: **We are a minority.** We are such a ***vastly*** small group of people that I could probably go out on the street and mention every /r/technology post within recent history to every single person I come across and not a single person would understand what the fuck I was talking about. If we want change to occur we need to bring that information, in easily digestible chunks, so that a 22 year old mother can understand in 5-10 minutes what the fuck we're talking about.<Enraiha>: Maybe. But you've essentially described essential flaws about a lot of important topics and distilling or trying to make diverse and complex systems into simple analogies lead to huge misconceptions. For example, politics and most fields of science. Look at politics. Try and distill down key plank points into something the \"22 single mother\" can understand leads to woefully simplified arguments that miss big parts of issues. Samething happens in science about anything climate change and don't try to mention anything about space. People are still not understanding things about black holes and such due to badly written articles. I'm not sure what the solution is unfortunately, but this is the problem democracies and republics. There's too many uninformed voices and opinions that get vote to decide on things that absolutely have no understanding of, but are expected to be informed of. Much like doctors and the concept of informed consent. How informed can the average person really be about complex medical procedures then expect to reasonably make a decision? I suppose in an ideal society, as we become more efficient and technology allows us to work less, we would be able to research and become more informed about more topics, but the current system is designed to keep people fatigued and tired, working 40+ hours a week when only 20ish are actually productive. Making an informed populous isn't so easy as making the information easy to understand.<senbei616>: The consistent failings of journalism in general but especially in regards to science is an entirely different topic. Almost everything about the NSA and Government spying atrocities can be explained to the common person in a short 10 minute explanation or in a few paragraphs. The important thing that this anti-Government Surveillance movement needs to get down is what *is* important and what is not. The common person doesn't need to know what deep packet inspection is or the ways in which the government is cataloguing and storing personal information. They just need to know that they definitely are doing all those things and that it's important for us to stop them. I'm all for improving technological literacy but that is a fight for a different day.<Enraiha>: I suppose my main point is...how do you prove and show what you're saying is important (and hey I know it is) to the common man? The average american? There's so much information and misinformation and spun info that how does the average person discern with info is \"good\" and which is \"bad\"? We're in an information glut with no filter, but we expect the average citizen to be aware and understand based on 5 and 15 minute snippets, but the competition is doing the same with counter-information. You NEED to focus on literacy and understanding of the topics. We've been distilling and breaking down complex topics forever, but before there weren't so many chefs in the kitchen. These days? So easy to disperse information and so much of it that without deeper knowledge of the subject, you're almost more of a danger than someone who is apathetic to the process. There's a reason you'll find people with no ties to the government or anything that will defend the collection of data due to some bad info that was passed off to them as truth in one of those 10 minute explanations. But again, that's the cynic in me.<senbei616>: &gt; how do you prove and show what you're saying is important (and hey I know it is) to the common man? Figures. We need well known, important figures talking about this and saying this is not cool. Neil Degrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, insert whoever the fuck is popular at the moment, we need these figures and others communicating that there is an issue and that the layman should be concerned with it. Failing that we need a figurehead for the movement itself. Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, CANNOT be our figureheads. They are criminals, and that's all the news media/general populace gives a shit about. We need someone who's respected in the tech community to come out and start actively campaigning and rallying in America to spread awareness and be the poster child.

The whole pro-life vs. pro-choice debate will be settled once and for all if we can somehow definitevely prove when life starts.<tomorrowsanewday45>: I think it's sad/funny how three months time is the division between clump of tissue, and unborn baby with the same rights as you and me. It's not a matter of where life begins, as a new, unique individual is formed at the meet of sperm and egg, with a DNA seperate of mommy and daddy. I think the question is, at what point is this formed individual considered a person. <Kazan>: traditionally speaking that woudl be at \"Viability\" - the point at which it can survive outside of the mother without life support technology. <tomorrowsanewday45>: See, I disagree with that. From conception this (I'm just going to use person for a lack of better terms) person will carry the same DNA until the day he/she dies. It's the same individual regardless. 85% to 90% of known pregnancies go to full term, which would be like pulling the plug on a coma victim knowing full well that in a few months they will come to and have full functionality once again. But regardless, it's the same human being. Hypotheticals aren't the answer to a long winded debate like abortion. However, hypothetically speaking, if we had the technology to reverse the age of living organisms, and someone reversed someone's age until they were the equivalent to one month of age (in womb) , would they then be fair game to dispose of? The answer would more then likely be a \"no\". Why? Because that's Johnny, or Billy, or Rachel. We would know the lives they'd live and would find it wrong to just dispose of this 1 month old clump of flesh knowing who'd they become. We typically don't see the person of an unborn baby ten, twenty or even eighty years down the line if they had been left alone to be born after 9 months. We just think it's just cell mass, or it can't survive, and deem it's life trumped compared to the will of the mother. <Kazan>: Cancer has DNA unique from the person its infecting, should we consider it a separate life that could be protected as well? Someone in a coma is not requiring someone else to give up control and safety of their body for them. Do you think that it is acceptable for us to force someone donate a bone marrow, a kidney, a lung, etc. to someone else who needs them? Do you realize that, from a standpoint of Theory of Rights, that is EXACTLY what you're demanding of women when you oppose abortion? Your technological reverse aging magic argument is irrelevant fantasy that doesn't have any pertinence to Theory of Rights. <tomorrowsanewday45>: If you believe that someone's life is trumped by the will of the mother that's your own prerogative. But don't try to peddle it off as anything but. &gt;Someone in a coma is not requiring someone else to give up control and safety of their body for them. That's implying that the mother had no contribution or bears no responsibility for the pregnancy. &gt;Do you think that it is acceptable for us to force someone donate a bone marrow, a kidney, a lung, etc. to someone else who needs them? Except the mother isn't giving up any bodily organs, and the actually percentage of the mother dieing from child birth is 0.00015%. Assuming most mothers have regular doctors visits, then there would be some indication of complications. If then it is known that there is a possibility of the mother losing her life, then, of course it's her call to decide whether she wants to take the risks, in which your equivalence makes sense. Outside of that, they are not the same thing. See, I could relate to your argument if women where being randomly impregnated, with no want of their own, and coming to term with the pregnancy meant that there was a substantial chance that there would be death or great bodily harm to the mother. But that just isn't the case. <Kazan>: &gt;That's implying that the mother had no contribution or bears no responsibility for the pregnancy. No prior act can abrogate your right to control your own body. &gt; Except the mother isn't giving up any bodily organs from the standpoint of Theory of Rights it makes no difference. Its ethically/rights-wise the same thing. You've decided that their rights are worth less than religious moral outrage. That's not libertarian. nor is it acceptable. <tomorrowsanewday45>: &gt;You've decided that their rights are worth less than religious moral outrage No, I could care less what people do with their bodies, and I'm certainly not active in restricting what people do to themselves. What I do feel is that an unborn's life is more important then the mothers choice. People have the right to life first and foremost. Your rights don't extend to harming others, or ending their life. Should a conjoined twin be able to seperate from his brother knowing that it will end in his brothers death? I would say no, because that brothers life is worth more then the other brothers will. No one is forced to donate organs, however we have those who are willing to donate. If we were able to transplant a fetus to a willing mother, then I would be all for it, because it means that the child still has a chance at life. At that point I wouldn't care if women had abortions because no one is being harmed from it. I believe people should have the liberty to do so long as they don't negatively obstruct on someone else's right to life and liberty. I understand your point, and I agree with most of it, but I disagree when it comes to this. <Kazan>: &gt; No one is forced to donate organs, however we have those who are willing to donate. Because it would be a violation of their rights under the very same principle that I'm using to justify that a woman's rights take precedent. You're making a special case exception. We both know which of those positions is easier to defend logically. &gt; What I do feel is that an unborn's life is more important then the mothers choice. And you're wrong. from a Theory of Rights standpoint the woman's right to control her own body and refuse to sacrifice of it for the sake of another life/potential-life takes precedence. ---- Entity A: Person w/ two kidneys Entity B: Person in need of kidney, will die without Entity B demands Entity A give integrity of its body, form of a kidney Entity A is under no obligation to do so. ---- Entity A: Woman (existing life) Entity B: Zygote (potential life) Entity B demands Entity A give up the integrity of its body, form of carrying a pregnancy to term. Entity A is under no obligation to do so. ---- Same principle, applied equally. no exceptions made. &gt; Should a conjoined twin be able to seperate from his brother knowing that it will end in his brothers death? That's a more complex question and I have no opinion on it. the fundamental theory of bodily sovereignty is in stymied by the fact that both rights-holding entities have equal priority - both are making the same demand of each other. &gt; I believe people should have the liberty to do so long as they don't negatively obstruct on someone else's right to life and liberty. That's exactly what you're defending though. When you force a woman to carry a pregnancy you're negatively obstructing them of their right to life, health and pursuit of happiness for the sake of another. Another potential entity. You have not even got to situations where I consider it unethical to NOT abort - when you would be knowingly creating a life of compromised quality of life and dependence as well as ruining the quality of life of existing persons. <tomorrowsanewday45>: &gt;And you're wrong Relative to your beliefs &gt;refuse to sacrifice of it for the sake of another life/potential-life takes precedence. Like I said, if it comes to the mothers life in question, then the decison to abort or not rests on the shoulders of the person whose life is at stake. Not many people will argue that. But considering 99.99985% of pregnancies don't result in the mother dieing, the choice to save the child's life or her own, is rarely made. &gt;That's a more complex question and I have no opinion on it. the fundamental theory of bodily sovereignty is in stymied by the fact that both rights-holding entities *have equal priority* - both are making the same demand of each other. There is strong equivalence between both situations. One twin can survive without the other, but the other twin is reliant on his brother to survive. Their demands are completely different. But as you said, both entities have equal priority. This parallels with a mother and child, except however, in just a few months child and mother will have been seperated. &gt;Another potential entity. 85-90% is more then a potential. &gt;when you would be knowingly creating a life of compromised quality of life and dependence as well as ruining the quality of life of existing persons. You're asserting that death is a far better option then poverty, or substandard living conditions, or the inconvenience of being inconvenienced by another's existence. I'm sure if you give someone the option of death, or living in poverty, they'd choose poverty. I just don't agree with you. <Kazan>: &gt; Relative to your beliefs Relative to actual modern understanding of theory of rights. &gt; Like I said, if it comes to the mothers life in question, then the decison to abort or not rests on the shoulders of the person whose life is at stake. Not many people will argue that. But considering 99.99985% of pregnancies don't result in the mother dieing, the choice to save the child's life or her own, is rarely made. Again, you're adding arbitrary restrictions onto a basic fundamental widely applicable right to assuage your PERSONAL moral beliefs. That has no place in law. You're imposing your personal opinion on others. &gt; This parallels with a mother and child, except however, in just a few months child and mother will have been seperated. no it doesn't, because under theory of rights they don't have equal precedence. &gt; 85-90% is more then a potential. irrelevant &gt; You're asserting that death is a far better option then poverty, or substandard living conditions, or the inconvenience of being inconvenienced by another's existence. I'm sure if you give someone the option of death, or living in poverty, they'd choose poverty. I'm not talking about poverty. I'm talking severe genetic and/or developmental defects &gt; I just don't agree with you. As long as you keep that your personal opinion and don't try to make it law I will fully support your right to disagree with me. Soon as you try to legislate your beliefs then you are my mortal enemy. <tomorrowsanewday45>: &gt;As long as you keep that your personal opinion and don't try to make it law I will fully support your right to disagree with me. Soon as you try to legislate your beliefs then you are my mortal enemy. \"mortal enemy\". Even though I tend to be more libertarian in most of my beliefs besides this one particular topic. You act like your beliefs are superior to mine (which you probably think anyway) Your right to choice does not trump the life of another, which is exactly what's going on with abortion. But oh well. Also, do you have any reading on the theory of rights? I'd be interested in reading more into it. Oh and it's not irrelevant. When there is a 90% chance that the infant will be born alive and grow up to be another free thinking individual such as yourself. <Kazan>: You really are having a problem with this fundamental concept - simple basics of rights. Its a university level thing, i'm sure there are textbooks. Unless you think that its ok to force someone to give up kidneys, longs, bone marrow, etc then its not ok to force a woman to carry a child to term either. Simple universally applied principle. Just because by refusing to give up your right another entity/potential-entity dies does not deprive you of your rights. Prior decisions to not deprive you of your rights. Forcing a woman to carry a child to term is fascist, not libertarian. &gt; You act like your beliefs are superior to mine (which you probably think anyway) You're right, I do. Because I'm not going around dishonestly telling myself i'm pro-rights while shitting all over the rights of women. <tomorrowsanewday45>: &gt;You really are having a problem with this fundamental concept - simple basics of rights. Its a university level thing, i'm sure there are textbooks. Lol I understand the concept fully. I just wasn't sure if there was a specific document or source that you are basing yourself in. There doesn't have to be political or philosophical absolutes, you can agree with some things and disagree with others to form your own political ideology. You have absolute control over your body and do as you please so long as it doesn't hurt others, and if your right means the disservice to others, then so be it. It's not a hard concept, I just don't agree with it when it comes to abortion (again, no political absolutes) There are some that feel they have the right to do whatever they please, regardless of other human life or rights. The majority of people reject that though because giving someone absolute freedom to do as they please means that someone else suffers. I will support laws that limits someone's freedom to kill or rape whom they want, because I don't think it's right for someone to be a victim, so even though it strips them of two freedoms, and limits their rights to do as they please, it's for the protection of others. In the same token, I see an unborn fetus as a person who has yet to be born, to grow old, to fall in love, to have kids blah blah, and although it strips the mother of *one* right, I, and millions of others, feel it's a fair trade off for the rights of that unborn. You can argue that my belief goes against the theory of rights, but that's irrelevant because I don't adhere fully to that ideology. Oh, and you can be pro-life and still support rape victim and disorder abortions, just as I can say I'm pro-rights, save for the single, and I do mean single, topic of abortion, out of millions of other areas where I *would* support personal freedom. <Kazan>: &gt; I just wasn't sure if there was a specific document or source that you are basing yourself in. Honestly at this point I don't remember when I learned theory of rights. My degree is B.Sci Computational Sci. I could harass my wife who has B.Sci Political and Sociological as she would probably know where to get references. &gt; There are some that feel they have the right to do whatever they please, regardless of other human life or rights. Is that a subtle accusation that I'm doing that? &gt; I will support laws that limits someone's freedom to kill or rape whom they want, because I don't think it's right for someone to be a victim, so even though it strips them of two freedoms, and limits their rights to do as they please, it's for the protection of others You don't have a right to kill or rape, just like you don't have a right to demand someone else sacrifice their bodily integrity so you can live. &gt; In the same token, I see an unborn fetus as a person who has yet to be born, to grow old, to fall in love, to have kids blah blah, and although it strips the mother of one right, I, and millions of others, feel it's a fair trade off for the rights of that unborn. I don't. I see you inventing a new right that does not exist, stripping someone else of their actually existing right. &gt; I can say I'm pro-rights, save for the single, and I do mean single, topic of abortion, out of millions of other areas where I would support personal freedom. So long as you admit to yourself that you're stripping someone of their rights with no ethical justification. and then never ever win at politics. <tomorrowsanewday45>: &gt;Is that a subtle accusation that I'm doing that? No &gt;You don't have a right to kill or rape Because society deems we don't have that right. In the past and even today there are societies that gave these rights to its citizens in relation to outsiders. The nazis gave themselves the right to mistreat and kill Jews, the Spanish established a right to mistreat and kill natives, Mao gave himself the right to starve and kill millions of his own people etc etc. Rights, politics, philosophies they are all relative to the people that choose to uphold them as their own. There is no right or wrong when it comes to politics, only what the collective choose to accept. &gt;I don't. I see you inventing a new right The right to life is not new. You seem to feel that a fetus only has rights if it can survive outside the womb. I don't. A women exercising her ability to abort directly results in the loss of life of another. Which is okay to you because you feel that right trumps that unborn's right to life. That's cool for you, but not me. &gt;with no ethical justification. The right to life for an unborn person is a pretty reasonable ethical justification for me. &gt;and then never ever win at politics That's just rich. Society determines what laws and rights we abide by. It's relative, meaning your particular ideology might be morally superior to you, but it's not for others. We've both exhausted our points and no one's changed their stance. I don't agree with you on abortion, and vice versa. <Kazan>: You're working from subjective rights where I'm trying to work from an objective/ethics system. That's probably part of the disconnect between our positions. &gt; The right to life is not new. You seem to feel that a fetus only has rights if it can survive outside the womb. The right to life is not new *for an individual*, a fetus is not an individual. Even if it were one in this case its right has lower precedence. &gt; Which is okay to you because you feel that right trumps that unborn's right to life. That's cool for you, but not me. &gt; It's relative, meaning your particular ideology might be morally superior to you, but it's not for others. I'm not the one trying to force others to adhere to my position. If i win you're free to follow your position, if you win we're all forced to follow yours. <tomorrowsanewday45>: &gt;You're working from subjective rights where I'm trying to work from an objective/ethics system. And the theory of rights may not be as subjective, but it is not absolute, which is what you're trying to convey. &gt;The right to life is not new for an individual, a fetus is not an individual. Even if it were one in this case its right has lower precedence. Which is where I disagree, I view the fetus as an individual. A blind man still has rights despite his lack of vision, a deaf mean still has rights despite his lack of hearing, the brain dead, the handicapped, the mute, the mamed, all lacking in something still has rights because they're are all still human. A fetus may be lacking the ability to walk, talk or even think, but it still has rights because it's still human, and it's precedence is equal to the mother. We obviously disagree here, and will continue to disagree considering our two fundamental differences on the issue. <Kazan>: You do love your false analogies. <tomorrowsanewday45>: Not quite, that's in relation to what makes a person a person. You don't think that a fetus is a person. On what grounds? They're less developed? That don't have a fully functioning mind? Etc etc blah blah<Kazan>: I made this very clear many many many many many many posts ago repeatedly. They're not able to survive without being wholly bodily dependent on another person/technological substitute for one. (Before you go there: that's different than a person on life support because life support is artificially replicating functions of a mature but failing body) <tomorrowsanewday45>: And going all the way back to my original comment, I find it humorous that people find a 24 week old fetus to be more human and more deserving of life then a 20 week old fetus because one can survive and the other cannot. Or according to some laws, a 3 month old fetus has as much rights as you and me, but a 2 month, 29 day old fetus is just chopped liver lol. Does this mean the conversation is restarting now? <Kazan>: Except its not as arbitrary as that, not at the theoretical level. Unfortunately when you map theory to practice sometimes things get crystallized in a seemingly arbitrary fashion. <tomorrowsanewday45>: Because it is arbitrary. The fact of the matter is that some may develop faster then others, one might be able to survive at 17 months, but because we go by typical outcomes, he'd be chopped up and pulled out. In any event, supporting full rights would mean the mother should be able to abort at 8 months, because people change minds. But at 8 months, or 7 months, or 6 months or even 5 months it can survive, meaning they would have to preserve the babies life, but the mother has no obligation to do that, so I'd suppose the state would have to, being funded as a social service that doesn't always go well with tradition libertarian thinking. Or just let it die, but that would be violating it's rights. Just curious, would you support abortion of up to 8 months? Or rather \"extration\" since you can't technically kill it. <Kazan>: &gt; Because it is arbitrary Hardly. When crystallized to concrete law you have to use the average date. &gt; he'd be chopped up and pulled out. You've clearly been listening to to much bullshit propaganda about late term abortions. The percentage of abortions performed late term that are not medically mandatory is miniscule. Of the ones that are not medically mandatory i would highly wager that most of those are of significantly developmentally or genetically compromised fetuses. &gt; In any event, supporting full rights would mean the mother should be able to abort at 8 months, because people change minds I draw the line at Viability because that is when you've already essentially assumed all the risk that you would otherwise and you could have the (now properly called a baby) baby removed with comparatively minimal risk. &gt; But at 8 months, or 7 months, or 6 months or even 5 months it can survive, No. Now you're getting into creating moving goalposts by using modern medical technology. incredibly costly modern medical technology. The definition of viability excludes these for a reason. &gt; being funded as a social service that doesn't always go well with tradition libertarian thinking. Or just let it die, but that would be violating it's rights. It has no rights until viability, even if it did its rights take lesser precedence than the woman's. Its that simple. I'm going to stop replying to you since you fundamentally refuse to respect a woman's rights. I hope you never get into a situation where you/your-partner might have to face needing to get an abortion as the only ethical option.<tomorrowsanewday45>: &gt; I draw the line at Viability because that is when you've already essentially assumed all the risk that you would otherwise and you could have the (now properly called a baby) baby removed with comparatively minimal risk. I'd like you to reference the theory of rights, which states you can't force someone to subject their bodies to harm or danger, or anything really, for the life of another. If you wouldn't force a person to give a kidney for another matured human being, then you can't force a mother who changes her mind 8 months into a pregnancy to not have an abortion if she wants to. &gt;It has no rights until viability, even if it did its rights take lesser precedence than the woman's. Its that simple. So what your saying is a developed \"baby\" has less rights then an adult woman? &gt;fundamentally refuse to respect a woman's rights. One right, please stop making it plural, you make me seem like some sort of misogynist. &gt;I hope you never get into a situation where you/your-partner might have to face needing to get an abortion as the only ethical option. I hope the same for you too, friend! Have a good one. <Kazan>: &gt; I'd like you to reference the theory of rights You want me to summarize a line of thought that dates back to the enlightenment in one post? &gt; If you wouldn't force a person to give a kidney for another matured human being, then you can't force a mother who changes her mind 8 months into a pregnancy to not have an abortion if she wants to. I like how you're cherry picking corner cases to try to make your case stronger &gt; So what your saying is a developed \"baby\" has less rights then an adult woman? Its not that its a baby, its that they're the one making a demand they have no right to make. I'm not sure how many different ways more I can state that then I already have. How about I try to draw an analogy with a less charged issue. We'll setup a similar scenario in property rights. Your neighbor wants to build a fence to protect their privacy, but because of the topography of the property line (retaining wall) they need to build it on your side of the property line. In this situation their right is lower-precedent to yours. They have no standing to make this demand of you. You can chose to tell them \"no\", you can chose to tell them \"yes\". Your rights take precedent here. &gt; One right, please stop making it plural, you make me seem like some sort of misogynist. There might be a reason for that (hint: i consider the pro-life position fundamentally misogynistic) &gt; I hope the same for you too, friend! Have a good one. You too. <tomorrowsanewday45>: You really don't have to explain or provide any more examples, I got it man (although your analogy doesn't fully line up, the baby isn't demanding discomfort for discomfort, but life for discomfort) . Like I said before, I fully understand the logic behind it. I just don't agree with it. And I'm not cherry picking, I'm bringing up a point that can be more controversial or problematic when your belief is applied. Also, valuing the life of another over the woman's choice to end that life != misogyny. <Kazan>: &gt; but life for discomfort that's incorrect. pregnancy can kill and maim. It is demanding life/health of her. &gt; Also, valuing the life of another over the woman's choice to end that life != misogyny. Creating a double standard where you selectively do not apply a general principle to a situation that only affects women is misogyny. <tomorrowsanewday45>: &gt;that's incorrect. pregnancy can kill and maim. It is demanding life/health of her. There's no reason to repeat things, and really no reason to continue this conversation. Like I said, there is 99.99985% chance a pregnancy will result in the mothers death. In which case, as I've said before, if the mothers life turns out to be in danger, then it's her choice to save her life or not. &gt;Creating a double standard where you selectively do not apply a general principle to a situation that only affects women is misogyny. The child's life is far more valuable then 9 months of discomfort, and you can be sure that if men could bear children too, I would be saying the same thing. Now, you said you didn't want to reply to someone like me, maybe you should stick to your word. I know this is reddit and everything, but maybe it's time to stop beating a dead horse. <Kazan>: &gt; There's no reason to repeat things, and really no reason to continue this conversation. Like I said, there is 99.99985% chance a pregnancy will result in the mothers death. In which case, as I've said before, if the mothers life turns out to be in danger, then it's her choice to save her life or not. as long as you fail to acknowledge facts i will repeat them. The **due to modern medicine** low chance of death does not change the fact it is asking her to risk her health and life. &gt; The child's life is far more valuable then 9 months of discomfort, and you can be sure that if men could bear children too, I would be saying the same thing. bullshit. on both counts. you keep minimizing what pregnancy is and I don't believe for one second if men could get pregnant abortion would be such a fight. You might honestly think you wouldn't believe differently but I don't - the culture around you would be vastly different. &gt; I know this is reddit and everything, but maybe it's time to stop beating a dead horse. I will never stop telling pro-lifers they're wrong. <tomorrowsanewday45>: &gt;I don't believe for one second if men could get pregnant abortion would be such a fight. I love when people start acting like they know me. I don't just lie to make points, why would I lie about this? Maybe because I honestly don't care about impededing on anyone's rights, but I will defend the right to life of the unborn, regardless of male or female. If an unborn child could sustain life outside the womb then I wouldn't care about abortions, I really wouldn't. Again, why? Because I'm not out to oppress women like your making me out to be. To be honest, I just don't care. But I do care about the lives of those who have no say. &gt;I will never stop telling pro-lifers they're wrong That implies your opinion is right, which it's not. Sorry, but the child's life is much much more important then 9 months of a baby belly. Now when the mothers life is at stake, then she should have the right to choose, because I agree with you, no one can make you give up your life for someone else.

How does this test in any way ensure net neutrality? It's just a series of basic NDTP (network diagnostic tool) requests to/from a single domain (measurement-lab.org) routed several different ways. Now if it tested the bandwidth you receive from series of domains, e.g. Netflix, piratebay, etc... and various different protocols known to be throttled by some ISPs, e.g. BTP (bittorent), NNTP (newsgroup), etc... then you could call it a net neutrality test. Though not really since there are still all sorts of other mitigating factors at play in your routing and connection speed to specific domains that you need to account for... many of which your ISP has absolutely no control over since the data is traveling through pipes/routers owned by the Tier 1/2 networks. But this battleforthenet 'test' is basically just a glorified bandwidth test.<DabneyEatsIt>: I spent the beginning of my career building ISPs in the early 90s. Apps like this were the bane of my existence. There was an app called Net.Medic that claimed to diagnose network problems your ISP had and allowed you to click a button and send reports of \"problems\" to the ISP. After trying to explain to people that this app was useless and was in no way an accurate representation of how a network functions (and politely telling them they they don't have the expertise to decipher most of the info it produced anyway), I just started filtering emails from the app. Networks are far too complicated for the average home user to even begin to understand what's going on, let alone diagnose \"problems\".<zefcfd>: People who know a tad about networks would scoff. However after taking a course on computer networks at my university, I am dumbfounded by the amount of concepts: inter/intra-domain communication protocols, peering, routing algorithms that are different from isp to isp and how they converge to a the shortest path through communication. hell even tcp/ip was eye opening. While i think I have a decent understanding of networking within the scope of my home network, I totally agree with you about the complexity outside of that. Its insane. <DabneyEatsIt>: This is exactly the case. There are so many ridiculously complicated things going on once that data left our gateway that we even had to look at the issue like a dog rolling his head from side to side until we would finally understand a problem and begin to fix it. The idea that some application sitting on a user's home PC could diagnose anything related to our network and beyond was ridiculous. I will never forgive the programmers who wrote that app.<ConsummateK>: And I get that. I recognize that there are a CRAZY amount of variables that can impact the end product that I receive. That said, I pay for 18mbit down Uverse and average about 4.5 when I'm wired directly to the modem/router. Their solution was to basically check that I'm not retarded, and then send me a new box. I just wish ISPs would take more ownership, do more leg work, and be a little more results driven when it comes to this sort of stuff. <Nakotadinzeo>: It's strange, a modern modem is a light Linux device instead of the assembly based devices of the past. The ISP will be putting a customized version of the firmware anyway.. Why they don't put remotely accessible diagnostic tools on them is beyond me. Imagine if you came home, and the phone company was putting a new line to your house because your router was detecting line damage? sweet.<Jadaki>: I can't imagine an ISP that doesn't already have network monitoring in place. How granular it gets varies based on software used and size of the ISP, but what your asking for is pretty much already taken care of by monitoring other parts of the network. <Nakotadinzeo>: With this level of granulation, you could get a better idea of what is going on. Let's say you overlay this information over a map, you could get a good idea where some issue is originating, and if a customer's issue is unique to them (house wiring for example). I think if you can shove a few more tools out there, do it. Information is power.<Jadaki>: I manage a team who runs and develops that type of software, most ISP's are going to have that info on some level. You have to keep in mind though that they are looking at it from a network perspective. You try to fix big issues before small ones. Nine times out of ten, if the customer isn't in an outage that's affecting their service it's a problem with the physical connection at the home. At least in our company it's rarely a design issue, though they have come up. It's kind of pointless to try and monitor diagnostics down to the customer premise for every residential customer, you would end up with a ton of data that's not cheap to store and a headache to make it useful. What do you do with people who shut their modems off every day, send a tech because their modems offline? You have any idea how much that would cost and how much of a time and money waste it would be?<Nakotadinzeo>: You wouldn't really need to record anything above a week, you could even discard data that comes back in an acceptable range. A modem that isn't online is the same as a residence that doesn't have service, and as long as it gave a good reading when it was online, who cares. But with these types of tools, you could find the wire a squirrel chewed up faster, make fairly accurate speed maps for marketing purposes (you can send junk mail with a much closer idea of the speed to non-customers.) and a tech could walk up to a house and have a lot of the tests he was going to run anyway in-hand before they get there. At worst, you have a little cruft in the DSL rom.<Jadaki>: You can't build a anything that's going to tell you a squirrel chewed a cable, and like 99% of the issues its going to require someone to come out and test to find out where the issue is on site. When a modem is off it shows offline to a CMTS and all monitoring tools, so do a lot of modems with connection issues. You can't say \"let me know when a modem is offline\" and then exclude the ones people turn off. If you can do it, i'm sure there is a software development company that would be happy to pay you a good 6 figure salary. <Nakotadinzeo>: As i understand it, there are two pair of useable data wires in a phone wire. IF one of them were damaged, it could switch to the other wire to transfer the data. And i wasn't really talking about a severed wire, i was talking about a wire that was damaged in such a way as to cause static/packet loss.<brewcitybastard>: I think you're missing the part where all of this is WAY over your pay grade.", "num_messages": 15, "avg_score": 466.8}

Yeah that removes a good 75% of the world or where abouts.<phillsphinest>: So you think it is beyond the realm of possibility that we can ever engineer glass with at least the same traction as asphalt when drenched, no matter how much research we do? Cuz if so I have some bad news for...It's already been done.<jaceame>: And make it as cheap as asphault is the key problem, not the posibility of creating something. We can make rockets to get us to mars, but it cost a few bucks. <phillsphinest>: And isn't doing it at all the first step in doing it more efficiently and/or cost effectively?<jaceame>: If you want glass go to chemists not these people. The people here are mostly just screwing around with stuff already known. To build the glass required it would take field specialist. <phillsphinest>: You've lost me. At first I thought you were saying that the idea of solar road is foolhardy because the glass used to protect the panels will be to slippery when wet. That's why I was informing you that others in similar projects have thought of this and solved the problem. Sure it's not as cheap as asphalt yet, but proving the concept is an important first step. Healthy and informed skepticism is very important to progress in any field, but it seems like alot of the skepticism in this thread is just uniformed so I'm just pointing it out. <jaceame>: I never said future glass is impossible (Will future glass be glass or some completely different transparent material?) simply that if you threw vast amounts of money at scientists they would eventually make it. My main problem is the following: \"Why? Why would you put complex and expensive technology in a dangerous place when we have millions of miles of deserts that are going without any use?\" I look at solar roads and see a waste of time when what we really need to do is make better batteries. We should shove solar panels into the desert where we can forget about them for decades without fear of a car accident causing a blackout as apposed to our roads. <phillsphinest>: I concede that asking why is a very fair and reasonable question, but are you asking it earnestly or rhetorically? Because your earlier comments seem to suggest you've made up your mind. If your asking earnestly here's a few answers I can think of: 1) Currently, road building is a mandatory activity for our societies. Since we must do it anyways, why not do it in away that maximizes our energy efficiency and even contributes energy to our grids? There's no physical reason for roads to be nothing more than asphalt trails - roads are our invention, and like all inventions we should improve them continuously. I find that making them energy generators is a worthwhile improvement that can be reasonably accomplished with photovoltaic cells and maybe even with piezoelectric cells too in the future. 2) Blanketing desert and rooftops with cells is a viable energy generation strategy too, but it's not exclusive of energy positive roads. As I said in point 1, we have to build roads whether they're energy positive or negative, so why shouldn't we promote space efficiency by putting in the effort to make them positive. If it turns out we need more energy after generating from roadways, then we can always farm deserts and rooftops too. 3) This goes beyond just generating energy for me. I think it's important for us as a species to be constantly improving everything. Sure, asphalt roadways serve their purpose, but dude, there are dozens of things our roads could do if we just allowed ourselves to imagine, then make the effort to realize them. We can go beyond energy positive roadways and make SMART roadways, that adjust lane markings for most efficient traffic flow, or heat themselves to deal with ice and snow, or sync with your car to let you know the parking spot closest to your destination. Are you telling me we shouldn't try to work out any of these because asphalt is just fine? Then why bother improving anything ever? <jaceame>: 1) Solar roads are currently an energy negative, 5-10$ per square foot vs. 50-100$ per square foot. 2) Roads are, according to the solar roads people, \"47,349.79 square miles\" as comparable to the Great Basin at 190,000 square miles, a good 100,000+ are suitable for solar fields. There is of course the Sahara being 3,600,000 square miles. So likely don't have to spend so much time and effort on getting the roads up to cuff. 3) Do you eat with a fork? 4) Being pessimistic is the right thing to do. There is a far larger likelihood that this never happens than it does. Just saying all the things that it might be able to do doesn't mean that it will accomplish any of those things. You and I have two differing ideologies, I believe in things that have been proven and can be measured, You believe in possibilities. Until your possibilities become reality I'm the correct one. RemindMe! five years from now \"Are solar roads functional or profitable\"? <phillsphinest>: I'm not convinced that you're thinking through your arguments before posting them because none of your retorts were well constructed. For example: 1) What does cost have to do with energy efficiency? Dollars are not a unit of measure of energy my friend. 2) Promoting space efficiency means that we should use as little space as necessary to meet our needs and reasonable desires because on Earth, it is finite, and all finite resources should be used wisely. If we must use 48,000sq mi of Earth as demarcation for appropriate travel routes, why not try to use that space for energy production too, before taking ever more finite space? You haven't shown me what we gain by not doubling roads as energy generators. 3) Yes I eat with a fork - an instrument invented by humans to augment our bare hands and has now evolved into an assortment of over 25 different variations to match many specific cutlery needs. So if you were thinking that the fork was delivered to mankind from heaven and had been unaltered since, you're mistaken. And even if you weren't, I don't see how thats an argument designing energy producing roadways? 4) Pessimism is the ONLY demonstrably useless position to hold. As I said to you earlier, informed skepticism is the ideal position, but you're not well informed on this subject because you were unaware of the extent of progress that's been made so far (I.e. you weren't aware they've already solved the wet glass traction loss). Since your not well informed, optimism is the next best position for you to hold, because your really not qualified to tell people what's impossible in this arena, so you should encourage them as to prevent stifling good ideas that may be beneficial to you someday. Think \"if you can't beat them, you might as well join them\". That's why I'm supportive of this endeavor. I have no information that says it cannot be done...I've been going back and forth with you for a couple hours and you are yet to tell me anything that shows definitively that it cannot be done...So I support them trying to do it and I can imagine the benefits already. As a career chemist, I've learned that nobody ever knows for sure when/ where/ who the next game changing ideas will come from. So don't shit on other peoples ideas just because it's your \"ideology\" to believe that things can never change or improve. That's faulty ideology since it fails to admit that everything most people treasure today was existed first as an imagination that people made real. I hope you'll grow to realize that someday. <playaspec>: &gt; I'm not convinced that you're thinking through your arguments before posting them because none of your retorts were well constructed. You should read this statement to yourself while looking into the mirror repeatedly until it sinks in that it applies to YOU. &gt; What does cost have to do with energy efficiency? Dollars are not a unit of measure of energy my friend. You're a fucking idiot. Cost matters. Cost matters a ***LOT***. If people like you were successful in running around implementing stupid ideas like this without regard to cost or efficacy, you'd bankrupt the country in a matter of weeks, without the slightest clue why. Go look up the figures of what it costs to produce a watt of rooftop solar, and the cost of producing one watt of solar roads. Which makes more sense to pay for? Go look up what 1 meter of rooftop solar produces, and what 1 meter of solar roadway produces. I dare you. Now that you have both cost and energy production figures, explain how roadways can beat rooftop. I defy you. The fact is you ***CAN NOT***. &gt; Promoting space efficiency means that we should use as little space as necessary to meet our needs and reasonable desires because on Earth, it is finite Are you fucking 12? Do you have *ANY* clue how much 'space' we take up? LOOK. IT. UP. &gt; all finite resources should be used wisely. Agreed. SO why the fuck are you championing squandering a *GINORMOUS* amount of energy to produce *glass* for roadways when glass is the *WORST* road material next to paper and lunch meat. &gt; If we must use 48,000sq mi of Earth as demarcation for appropriate travel routes, Quit trying to sound intelligent. You've failed at the miserably already. &gt;why not try to use that space for energy production too Because it does't make ***ANY*** sense. &gt; You haven't shown me what we gain by not doubling roads as energy generators. FAIL. It's up to ***YOU*** to show what is gained by making roadways energy producers. It's your argument, YOU prove it. I've already shown elsewhere in this thread why it's a total failure. &gt; As I said to you earlier, informed skepticism is the ideal position And yet you fail completely to hold this position. Nothing that you have argued could be considered 'informed'. &gt; but you're not well informed on this subject Wow. Pot, kettle, black. You've proven yourself to be perhaps the ***LEAST*** informed person in this entire thread. Again, do the fucking math. Absolutely ***NOTHING*** about this bullshit technology makes sense. &gt; because you were unaware of the extent of progress that's been made so far And you haven't provided evidence of it either, because you're completely ***FULL OF SHIT***. &gt; you weren't aware they've already solved the wet glass traction loss Citation? Quit talking out your ass and show us ***PROOF*** that glass exists that has the same or better fricative qualities as asphalt. We'll be waiting. &gt; Since your not well informed Better get back to that mirror. I should start a petition to rename Dunning-Keruger to /r/phillsphinest &gt; because your really not qualified to tell people what's impossible in this arena When it comes to calculating efficiency of solar and the costs thereof, I am. Again, you have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that ***YOU*** are not in any way, shape, or form, qualified to be commenting on the validity of this bullshit technology. Again, just do the math. &gt; That's why I'm supportive of this endeavor. Because you're willfully ignorant of ***EVERYTHING*** you're talking about? That's just frightening. Blind ignorance in action. &gt; As a career chemist.... I shudder to think that someone with your total lack of ability to analyze a simple technology such as solar is employed in the sciences. I guess chemistry isn't really a science since you've proven that it does't require critical thought or empirical evidence. I had no idea that chemistry was based on uninformed gut instinct. &gt; I've learned that nobody ever knows for sure when/ where/ who the next game changing ideas will come from As an electronics engineer I've learned that there is a never ending torrent of clueless, uninformed bullshit artists and armchair experts who dispense with facts and instead rely entirely on 'feeling' to drive their world view. &gt; So don't shit on other peoples ideas just because it's your \"ideology\" to believe that things can never change or improve. I don't. I shit on people's ignorance when it's sold as if it were knowledge. I've spent my life *testing* what is true and what is not. I've dug for answers even when the result was contrary to my world view, and I've admitted when I'm wrong and admitted my error when shown compelling evidence to change what I thought I knew. Can you say the same? I suggest you learn about energy, electronics, and solar technology, and understand it thoroughly before you do.<phillsphinest>: Lmfao...If you like to shit on people's ignorance, than you must have a ton of shit on your own face because you are the single most ignorant user I've ever had the displeasure of responding to. You're so fucking ignorant, you seem to think that using personal attacks actually strengthens your argument or intimidates your opponent, when in reality it just makes the other guy attack you back (as I will do shortly), it makes you look and sound foolishly defensive even if you're right, and it stifles the sharing and evaluation of information (the first objective of a debate). This is all evident by the fact that I almost stopped reading your response the second you called me a \"fucking idiot\". Fortunately, I decline pissing matches with aggressive fools, so this will be my only retort to you, unless you decide to change tactics and debate correctly. If you do, tone down the personal attacks, and present facts as an adult. Save the ape like temper tantrums for the pre pubescent children you seem used to arguing with. If you respect me, even when you think I'm wrong, I'll respect you back even when I think your wrong, and maybe we'll both learn something and become wiser individuals. If you attack me personally, because you think your right and I'm wrong, that's actually qualifying evidence that your a dumb fuck and I'll certainly call you out as such to warn others, then ignore you and continue to learn with others who know better. As time goes on, I'll become wiser and accrue a wider range of knowledge, you'll still be a dumb fuck attacking people on the web to compensate for their mental deficiencies. Again, I do not suffer aggressive fucktards as is it is a waste of my most precious resource, time. However, I do enjoy learning and respectfully sharing knowledge when I can, with people whom are diverse in lifestyle, profession, and opinions. A prerequisite for this of course, is that you actually have knowledge to share, not just insults to hurl. So please do at least a little research before responding to those who have. Here's the link you rudely requested and might have found yourself had you given the smallest effort. I suggest starting your research here: <http>://www.solarroadways.com/faq.shtml There you'll find an exhaustive list of questions and concerns answered. After reading through it, feel free to shove your shit right back up your dumb ass. When you've finished that, I suggest you smoke a dub and calm the fuck down. Then come back here and talk to me like an adult, minus the personal attacks. If while doing your research you've learned something you think I've overlooked (something you haven't done yet), coolly and respectfully help me see it too, and I'll actually really appreciate you for it. Otherwise, if you attack me personally, I will attack you back and call you out as just a stupid bastard parading as an internet gangster, whom deserves to be ignored, regardless of the quality of your arguments. Accordingly, I won't respond to you any further. So with that, I wish you best of luck, and I thank you at least for being the perfect example of how not to debate with people on the internet!", "num_messages": 20, "avg_score": 253.95}

Businesses managed to establish great power in certain regions, private armies were hired (Pinkertons) and they organized their own currencies which could only be used in their company stores. Many of them could (and did) have greater power over a region than the local governments did. &gt;There is no recourse when the government is corrupt or abusive, which happens all too often Which government? There's certainly recourse in many governments. Such a claim is unfounded, and I'm going to call *your* bluff. <novanleon>: Businesses regularly use their own currency even today (ever hear of store credit?). Businesses regularly employ their own security forces even today. Heck, the Pinkerton security agency still exists today. Nobody was forced to participate in the disputes between businesses and unions. Nobody was forcing people to work. People were always free to leave. Even the worst incident between the Pinkertons and the unions resulted in no more than a handful of deaths for which there were prompt repercussions. &gt; Which government? There's certainly recourse in many governments. Such a claim is unfounded, and I'm going to call your bluff. All of them, to varying degrees. Comparing the Pinkertons, the absolute worst possible example of business overreach or abuse you can come up with, with the atrocities that governments, like, say... Nazi Germany, Communist Russia, Rwanda, the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, or the countless other examples I can pull from at the drop of a hat... can commit against their own people *without repercussion or fear of consequence* is laughable. Even the relatively minor violations of civil rights committed by the USA in the last 20 years make the Pinkertons pale in comparison. In short, you have no idea what you're talking about.<LukaCola>: You're setting up your own strawmen here. I'm not comparing \"good and bad\" which is a stupid argument to make anyway. I'm stating that there were times when businesses got significant power, enough to form informal governments in certain regions in the US, and they abused what they had. Now obviously I'm not saying all of them did so. &gt;Businesses regularly use their own currency even today (ever hear of store credit?) Complete apples and oranges. Paying your workers in money that could only be spent in the company store (or participating retailers) is an entirely different beast. &gt;Businesses regularly employ their own security forces even today. Heck, the Pinkerton security agency still exists today. Nobody was forced to participate in the disputes between businesses and unions. Businesses and workers mostly, unionizing would get most workers fired. And people do not hire security today to break up strikes. And for the longest time these companies were allowed to operate freely and protected in their actions, it took a long time for worker's rights to form. &gt;with the atrocities that governments Which is a pointless statement. It's like saying \"The atrocity of peoples\" Governments are a natural societal manifestation, a relationship between leaders and led that has existed since time immemorial. The shape those governments take changes of course. And they exist and persist through many thousands of years. To speak for all of them is to speak for all of human history, which no one is knowledgeable enough, qualified enough, or has any authority to do so. Least of all you who would attempt to do so regardless. I get it. You love free market, hate government. Business good, government bad. My views are a bit more nuanced than that. Sorry you have a hard time dealing with it. <novanleon>: Naivety =/= nuance On an fundamental level, yes. People, or rather, human nature, is the culprit. Government just happens to be the ultimate construct for projecting power that human beings have. The state's power and authority, and hence capacity for evil, is far greater than anything else human's have constructed. This has been my point from the beginning. SolarAquarion and yourself are the ones who tried to shift focus from government to business. *You* were the one who trying to claim \"government good, business bad\". History just isn't on your side. <LukaCola>: &gt;You were the one who trying to claim \"government good, business bad\". History just isn't on your side. Quote me &gt;The state's power and authority, and hence capacity for evil, is far greater than anything else human's have constructed. Unironically calling a collection of people evil... And I'm the naive one? Please. So what, are all governments agents of Lucifer or something? Am I supposed to turn to the gospel of Wal-mart in these times or something? Business as our saviors? Businesses are just as capable of bad and good as governments, it's all the same. Although their motivations are generally profit driven, which is rarely in the interest of the many, I will say that. What motivates governments? Depends on the government, the time period, the place, etc. Any number of things. Come on. You're ignoring all nuance and asserting a single story as the truth. What you're saying is hardly the analysis made by a knowledgeable (or all that intelligent) man. It's incredibly shortsighted. <novanleon>: &gt; Unironically calling a collection of people evil... And I'm the naive one? Not evil. Capacity for evil. &gt; Please. So what, are all governments agents of Lucifer or something? Am I supposed to turn to the gospel of Wal-mart in these times or something? Business as our saviors? Businesses are just as capable of bad and good as governments, it's all the same. What is this nonsense? &gt; Although their motivations are generally profit driven, which is rarely in the interest of the many, I will say that. I'm not even going open that can of worms. &gt; Come on. You're ignoring all nuance and asserting a single story as the truth. What single story? What are you even talking about? You're not making any sense at all. &gt; What you're saying is hardly the analysis made by a knowledgeable (or all that intelligent) man. It's incredibly shortsighted. Coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment. I never said anything about businesses being good OR bad. I merely said business wasn't anywhere near as powerful as government and therefore had nowhere near the same capacity for evil. You're the one who injected the morality of business into this discussion. You're the one who brings up nonsense about Wal-Mart and free market versus government for no reason. You're the one with the shortsighted, single-track, government vs. business perspective (as if the two were somehow opposed in the first place). Government is a group of human beings all with their own selfish motives just like business. They're susceptible to the same flaws of human nature. The key difference is that government has virtually unlimited power and authority, and hence capacity for evil. I find it perplexing that you can't understand this, but given your obvious biases, perhaps I shouldn't be so surprised. To you and people like you, government is the answer to all of society's problems and business is the \"big bad evil\" to be cut down to size. It's so cliched that it's yawn-worthy, yet you think it's nuanced and sophisticated. Way to pat yourself on the back for swallowing cliched leftist tropes, hook, line and sinker. Congrats.<LukaCola>: &gt;nowhere near the same capacity for evil. You're the one who injected the morality of business into this discussion. Wow, literally one sentence after another, talk about lacking self-awareness... What the hell is \"evil\" supposed to mean if it's not a moral judgment? Furthermore, what is \"A capacity for evil\" anyway? Here, let's stop with this \"Evil and good\" nonsense. It's really bad politics in and of itself. &gt;The key difference is that government has virtually unlimited power and authority It's been long established that governments gets power and authority from its people through various means. Governments that don't never last long. They exist in a vacuum, and never has any government obtained \"virtually unlimited power and authority\" so such a claim is completely absurd. Even Hobbe's Leviathan doesn't have unlimited power and that's purely theoretical. So your assertion there is pure absurdity. &gt;I find it perplexing that you can't understand this I find it perplexing that you can't stop being so dramatic in everything you say, using words like good and evil unironically while speaking of \"unlimited power and authority\" and other such rot. You completely miss any opportunity for actual discussion and instead make a mockery of the entire thing. &gt;To you and people like you, government is the answer to all of society's problems and business is the \"big bad evil\" to be cut down to size. I said no such thing, at most I said businesses were generally profit driven, is that inaccurate? I'm arguing against this absurd idea of yours where governments seem to be capable of nothing but \"evil\" while businesses do not have such capacity. It's completely unfounded. Like I said and will say again: You cannot speak for the entirety of government all government ever and expect to say anything remotely accurate in any sense of the word. That is the height of stupidity, and I won't take part in it. <novanleon>: &gt; Wow, literally one sentence after another, talk about lacking self-awareness... What the hell is \"evil\" supposed to mean if it's not a moral judgment? &gt; Furthermore, what is \"A capacity for evil\" anyway? I don't care how you define it. More power and authority make it more possible. The \"capacity for evil\" is how capable someone or something is of doing something evil. How you define evil isn't even really important. Power is, by definition, greater capacity to do something. A policeman is more capable of evil than an everyday citizen by virtue of the power and authority he has over others. Same concept. &gt; I find it perplexing that you can't stop being so dramatic in everything you say, using words like good and evil unironically while speaking of \"unlimited power and authority\" and other such rot. &gt; You completely miss any opportunity for actual discussion and instead make a mockery of the entire thing. Your inability to understand the concepts being discussed doesn't make them \"dramatic\". &gt; I'm arguing against this absurd idea of yours where governments seem to be capable of nothing but \"evil\" while businesses do not have such capacity. It's completely unfounded. /*facepalm/* Where did I say governments are capable of nothing but evil? Whose being dramatic now? You either have no reading comprehension or you're such a \"babe-in-the-woods\" where this topic is concerned, you seriously can't follow the discussion.<LukaCola>: &gt;Where did I say governments are capable of nothing but evil? Whose being dramatic now? You have not even entertained the idea that power can be used for anything besides \"evil.\" It's all you go on about. What conclusion am I supposed to draw here? What point could you possibly be making? Have you even thought about that? &gt;How you define evil isn't even really important. It is critically important, the fact that you think so shows me you have no formal knowledge or education on politics at all. There's a reason I mocked the concept earlier. Don't use the term evil, it's stupid. You don't use the term \"Bad\" either. Nobody knows what you're talking about then. I mean even \"abuse of power\" would be more acceptable and that's still an incredibly broad term. Think for a second about what you're saying and the point you're trying to make, then come back to me. <novanleon>: &gt; I mean even \"abuse of power\" would be more acceptable and that's still an incredibly broad term. I said it doesn't matter how you define it. Define it as \"abuse of power\" for all I care. The fact that government has more capacity for \"abuse of power\" remains true now matter how you define \"evil\". You're floundering around in search of a decent argument. At this point you're trying to turn it into a semantic argument when the semantics are already crystal clear. If you can't understand concepts like \"power\" or \"evil\" which are intended to be broad, then perhaps this discussion isn't for you and you should bow out.<LukaCola>: &gt; If you can't understand concepts like \"power\" or \"evil\" which are intended to be broad, then perhaps this discussion isn't for you and you should bow out. You're right, it's not for me. I actually study the subjects and have some academic experience. If I ever approached the subject from your angle I would've failed even my Freshman courses. That kind of broad undefined nonsense is precisely the stuff that leads to misinformation and halve-truths which is the last thing anyone should want. But clearly you can't actually operationalize your terms, so I can only come to the conclusion that you don't understand them. There's a reason academics stay far, far away from terms such as good and evil. Hell even \"Justice\" is difficult enough, you could fill a library on the subject. But I'm sure you'd just cast it out there like you would anything else, completely failing to understand the least of it. And the worst part is you think you've got some kind of point to make. And I'm not floundering for my argument. I'm searching for yours. It's pretty clear you have nothing to say besides \"Government can do bad things\" which I would say is such a worthless statement that I should begin charging you for wasting my time. Thanks for the high school level political analysis. I'm sure the kids in class were highly impressed by your highly insightful criticism.<novanleon>: Are you kidding me? Academics *love* to discuss \"good\", \"evil\", \"justice\" and \"morality\". I frequent several blogs that are filled with professors discussing these topics. These topics are many academic's bread and butter. Regardless, the fact that I said the definition is irrelevant to the point seems to have completely eluded you. You could replace \"evil\" with \"harm\", or \"pick flowers\", or \"eat ice cream\", or \"kick puppies\" and my point would have been the same. The word \"evil\" is just something for you to nitpick and complain about because you really don't have anything constructive to say. Given your inability to comprehend my point, for your benefit, let me rephrase my statement to remove the term \"evil\": *The state's power and authority, and hence capacity to affect the lives of the people within it's domain, is far greater than anything else human being's have constructed.* This isn't even about politics. This is a simple exercise in rationality. If Car X has 10 gallons of gas and Car Y has 5 gallons, Car X obviously has the capacity to travel further distance or cover more ground than Car Y. If the state has more power than any other human institution it obviously has more capacity to affect the world around it. I'm not even sure how we can still be disputing this. I personally think you're incapable of admitting that governments are more likely to be abusive, corrupt, tyranical (i.e. \"evil\") than not. You're unable to cope with the cognitive dissonance this would cause you, therefore you nitpick about the word \"evil\" as if it was beneath you to use such an archaic term. <EDIT>: Reprasing for clarity.<LukaCola>: &gt;Academics love to discuss \"good\", \"evil\", \"justice\" and \"morality\" In very specific circumstances in very defined terms, you can see the classic example of this being demonstrated in Plato's \"Republic.\" Basically, how they discuss it is night and day compared to the way you discuss it. As I said, you can fill a library with discussion on justice. But academics do go out of their way to avoid the terms when making a point about something else, as the discussion will rest entirely on what those terms mean as a consequence. Hence why I keep asking you to define them. You follow? &gt;Regardless, the fact that I said the definition is irrelevant to the point seems to have completely eluded you. Oh it didn't elude me. I just contest it. It is extremely relevant. If you fail to define what you mean by those terms, you cannot possibly claim to be making a statement or a point. If you're too broad, you either state half truths or something that is completely obvious or pointless. &gt;my point would have been the same And what point is that? Because this? &gt;The state's power and authority, and hence capacity to affect the lives of the people within it's domain, is far greater than anything else human being's have constructed. That's a statement, not a particularly meaningful one. Like I said, totally worthless. Not once did I contest that, I have been trying to derive something meaningful from it. I don't think there is anything though. There's no point to be made here. Again, you are talking in far too broad terms, you are in many ways stating the obvious. It's about as meaningful as \"People are capable of forming societies that can kill a lot of other people.\" Wow. Stop the fucking presses. <novanleon>: What exactly are you still here posting for then? You haven't understood a single thing I've said this entire time and yet you still continued to complain and whine and argue and make completely random and unrelated arguments about Wal-Mart and business and academia and the definition of \"evil\". Now you're trying to play it off as if what I'm saying is meaingless, despite your inability to understand what I've been talking about since you joined the discussion. If what I'm saying so incomprehensible or meaningless to you, why are you even still here? I wasn't even talking to you to begin with. You injected yourself into my conversation with SolarAquarion and you haven't said anything particularly insightful, relevant or constructive since you started. What's the point? Honestly, this is getting absurd. If you're going to keep this discussion alive, at least contribute something constructive. Otherwise, I think we're done here.<LukaCola>: I'll ask again: What was your point My point was that there were businesses which took up government like positions during the early 20th century in America. You \"called my bluff\" and then went off on my over some nonsense and brought the discussion about the evil of government. See we HAD an actual point of discussion but you derailed it. It's not my lack of understanding, I have been *trying* to get you on track or to talk about something meaningful. Look back at what you \"called me out on\" and then read who started going off on tangents. And no, I am not misunderstanding you. You fail to understand how banal your statements are.<novanleon>: Before you even entered the conversation SolarAquarion made the statement that [\"the state isn't evil\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/36psk8/direction_of_reddit_a_safe_platform/crgkfn7). My response was that the \"state\" is perhaps the greatest evil known to mankind throughout history. The worst crimes and atrocities committed against mankind have always been committed by \"the state\". You didn't even join the conversation until five posts later. Your first comment was in support of SolarAquarion's argument that businesses from the industrial age were comparable to the government in power (and presumably their capacity for evil). I refuted this point by [citing historical examples of evil acts perpetrated by governments that your single industrial age example couldn't even compare to](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/36psk8/direction_of_reddit_a_safe_platform/crlb4x8), and that was just to name a few. From [this point](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/36psk8/direction_of_reddit_a_safe_platform/crldke8) forward you go completely off the rails and begin complaining about terminology, the free market, \"agents of Lucifer\", the \"gospel of Wal-Mart\", \"moral judgement\" and an endless number of other things that were nonsensical and irrelevant to the discussion. I specifically [called you on this](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/36psk8/direction_of_reddit_a_safe_platform/crlh7ah) the moment it began to happen. Regardless, from that point on nothing you've said has made any sense in the context of the original discussion and, quite frankly, you've just sounded like someone floundering around in an effort to make a point. I'll re-iterate my first point in response to you. No atrocity, abuse of power, corruption, crime or other \"evil\" acts perpetrated by a business have EVER come close to the scope and severity of those perpetrated by governments. Not even close. It's not even comparable. <EDIT>: I don't really think there's a point in continuing this discussion.<LukaCola>: &gt;You didn't even join the conversation until five posts later. You act as if there's some sort of etiquette or rules to online posting. I saw a statement and wanted to comment on it. I wasn't even going to touch the original argument of whether or not the state is evil. You dragged me into it. &gt;Your first comment was in support of SolarAquarion's argument that businesses from the industrial age were comparable to the government in power (and presumably their capacity for evil). I refuted this point by citing historical examples of evil acts perpetrated by governments that your single industrial age example couldn't even compare to, and that was just to name a few. That doesn't refute the point at all... Do you know what it means to refute something? I said they were comparable in their power, evidenced through their actions of the era. The fact that you think I gave a shit about your nonsense argument regarding the \"capacity of evil\" for the state is entirely nonsense. &gt;From this point forward you go completely off the rails and begin complaining about terminology, the free market, \"agents of Lucifer\", the \"gospel of Wal-Mart\", \"moral judgement\" and an endless number of other things that were nonsensical and irrelevant to the discussion. I specifically called you on this the moment it began to happen. Yeah, I was mocking what you were talking about. It's complete nonsense, good and evil in regards to the state? I mean for fuck's sake. &gt;I'll re-iterate my first point in response to you. No atrocity, abuse of power, corruption, crime or other \"evil\" acts perpetrated by a business have EVER come close to the scope and severity of those perpetrated by governments. Uh, okay, that still doesn't have anything to do with my original point. It's an entirely different side-note that you wanted to soapbox on. And I knew you were trying to make that point, as I said before, and will continue to say: It's a worthless point to make. It's so broad it fails to state anything. &gt;I don't really think there's a point in continuing this discussion. No shit, you're severely lacking in education on the subject to speak on it. I don't know why I always try to find something in online discussions, I just hope that occasionally, very occasionally, someone on reddit's defaults will take their heads out of their own asses long enough to understand what it means to discuss a matter.<novanleon>: &gt; You act as if there's some sort of etiquette or rules to online posting. I saw a statement and wanted to comment on it. You are obligated to understand the context of the discussion that you join. It's not a rule; it's common sense. Otherwise you risk of missing the context behind the points being made, like you have in this case. &gt; I wasn't even going to touch the original argument of whether or not the state is evil. Well you failed miserably, considering you jumped right into the middle of it. &gt; No shit, you're severely lacking in education on the subject to speak on it. I don't know why I always try to find something in online discussions, I just hope that occasionally, very occasionally, someone on reddit's defaults will take their heads out of their own asses long enough to understand what it means to discuss a matter. Your inability to find someone on reddit worthy of engaging in discussion with you leads me to believe you're the problem, not everyone else. <LukaCola>: &gt;You are obligated to understand the context of the discussion that you join. Oh fuck off you self-righteous twat. I started my own discussion by creating a separate thread in response to someone else, YOU wanted to remain as part of that discussion and further your soap box. I did EVERYTHING I COULD to take you off of it. You're just a horribly self-centered fucker who thinks everyone needs to do as you please as if you own the conversation. It was a stupid fucking thing to talk about from the start, and only a stupid fucking person would insist on its discussion. Congrats on fulfilling that role. &gt;considering you jumped right into the middle of it Oh yeah cause I totally responded to that comment. You're a fucking idiot who doesn't understand how online commenting works, that's what happened. And you were way too headstrong to drop it. &gt;Your inability to find someone on reddit worthy of engaging in discussion with you leads me to believe you're the problem, not everyone else. Oh there's plenty of good people to talk with outside the defaults. But the odds of finding someone who really knows anything about politics, beyond their own pet interests, and then knows how to talk about them? Forget it. <novanleon>: &gt; I started my own discussion by creating a separate thread in response to someone else, YOU wanted to remain as part of that discussion and further your soap box. What are you talking about? [You responded to ME.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/36psk8/direction_of_reddit_a_safe_platform/crhofbe) &gt; Oh yeah cause I totally responded to that comment. You commented in a conversation between two other people that began with, and was centered around, the government's nature and capacity for evil. The comparison between government and business was based on their relative power and authority and hence capacity for evil. The [record of our conversation](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/36psk8/direction_of_reddit_a_safe_platform/crgkfn7) is clear-as-day and available for everyone to see. I don't know what else to say.<LukaCola>: &gt;What are you talking about? You responded to ME. Woops, it was you. Regardless, it was on a single matter. I had no intention or desire to go into whatever else you were talking about, and I don't know why you think I'm obligated to discuss it. If you think I'm somehow at folly for not following what you think is proper etiquette, tell it to someone who cares. &gt;You commented in a conversation between two other people that began with, and was centered around, the government's nature and capacity for evil. Which is a stupid as fuck conversation, and I'm not required to take part in it, I specifically commented on one thing and one thing only. I created a separate chain. Because you made a statement, and I wanted to discuss that statement. I'm not required to discuss the entire nonsense argument just because I wanted to discuss one statement. Either way, the discussion would've played out the same way anyway. You needed to identify your terms, define them, then operationalize them. You have consistently failed and refused to do so, so there's no point anyway. You got anything of actual consequence to say now or do you just like hearing yourself talk? <novanleon>: &gt; Which is a stupid as fuck conversation, and I'm not required to take part in it, I specifically commented on one thing and one thing only.

There isn't any \"access to the public\" - the public has the right to engage *with each other* free of interference.

The only notable difference is tort liability, which may or may not exist independent of legislation depending on the legal tradition of a society.

But even granting that point, doesn't that limit this ethical principle to only business that exist as corporations?

Just as there are substantial regulations you avoid if you don't take credit cards and don't engage in interstate (or international) commerce. I am only addressing the idea that 'access to the public' is a right (I'm guessing you mean natural right) by pointing out that business entities aren't 'natural' and only have those rights that are given to them. Whether or not the public has the right to regulate access to itself is an entirely different line of inquiry.<nogodsorkings1>: &gt;Being incorporated has nothing to do with being publicly held or not. You're right; I'm being sloppy with my language. Fundamentally, I find the corporate distinction an awkward way to duck the question of the scope of government in the economy. Certain behaviors in commerce should be legal or not. We (collectively) don't envision, for example, OSHA or Wage/Hour regulation as being dependent on the legal organization of the workplace. &gt;I am only addressing the idea that 'access to the public' is a right (I'm guessing you mean natural right) by pointing out that business entities aren't 'natural' and only have those rights that are given to them. I don't see it as a right so much as I view it as a logically impossible concept to begin with, in the same way it makes no sense to describe a wave as being separated from the water through which it travels. I would reject the statement of business as non-natural for the purposes of conversation. If only in the idealized form I have described, businesses have no special rights whatsoever, but are merely clusters of coordination, \"lumps of butter coagulating in a pail of buttermilk\" as D.H. Robertson would put it. What I'm really saying is, the distinction you are making seems like an ethical red herring. If the corporation as a model were forgotten tomorrow, the justification for these laws would not be forgotten with it. That wasn't a part of the story until the original justification fell out of favor or was forgotten entirely.<laosurvey>: I'd like to be clear on whether or not you're officially moving the goalposts, which I am fine as long as we agree to it. You're initial statement I was addressing &gt;the public has the right to engage with each other free of interference Does not apply because business entities are not part of the public. They do not have voting rights, citizenship, etc. They are regulated entities from the first moment they existed. If you want to discuss whether the government has the 'right' to regulate trade between individuals, I think the answer is fairly easy: it does if people say it does. Also, &gt;I would reject the statement of business as non-natural for the purposes of conversation. is a slight twisting of my statement. I said business entities, not business. Are you claiming business entities are 'natural.' I'm actually okay with that, but that same logic suggests that governments and their regulations are also natural as they are nothing more than clusters of coordination.<nogodsorkings1>: I do not mean to change the scope of conversation. To me, a business entity requires no recognition from the state at all to function, and should inherit all the rights of the people who created it.<laosurvey>: Including voting? The right to hold public office? The right to bear arms (and be part of a militia)? The right to not be a slave?<nogodsorkings1>: I think we're talking past each other a bit. No business entity has more or less than what the people in it bring to the table. Everyone who works for or owns stock in SomeCorp has a vote; In this sense, one might say SomeCorp \"has\" 10,000 votes or whatever, but it's not like there are extra votes with SomeCorp's name on it, as SomeCorp is only an abstraction through which parties share ownership and have contracts under one name. Businesses own weapons already, and if I you and I can own rifles, I don't see why any legal entity we create together shouldn't do the same. Oddly, businesses today have can have even more weapons rights than the general public (PMCs and whatnot), probably owing to it being easier to regulate them vs. 300 million potential idiots who think they need an anti-tank weapon.<laosurvey>: Business entities are property. Property does not have rights in and of itself. Business entities have been granted rights because it is convenient or useful. If and when a particular right or lack thereof is no longer convenient or useful, the rights will probably be changed. Business entities confer a substantial benefit in shielded liability and ownership transfers. As there are costs to being a corporation (and most other legal business entities), it's reasonable to guess that individuals find these benefits to be real and exceeding what they, themselves, could individually 'bring to the table.' Otherwise, why would individuals pay the cost of owning a business entity?<nogodsorkings1>: The firm comes about to economize on transaction costs and facilitate combinations of ownership that scale far better than would be possible with ad-hoc agreements. The only really special privilege is tort liability, but I have no opinion on that and don't care to defend it. I think you and I have fundamentally incompatible moral frameworks.", "num_messages": 15, "avg_score": 466.6}

In short, it is a single card that is capable of mimicing most or all of the cards in your wallet on-demand, for the purpose of keeping your wallet small and more secure. It has a small touchscreen to display the standard credit card info and is the same size as a credit card, flexible and waterproof. It supports mimicking barcodes, tap-and-go, magnetic strips and chip-cards. It can be configured to require a pin number and/or proximity to your phone in order to operate. Nobody knows how well this technology will take hold, but it certainly *could* entirely replace the concept of carrying multiple physical cards. You can [pre-order Plastc here](https://share.plastc.com/x/hz49oj) for $20 off. Their web site is [here](https://www.plastc.com/), FAQ is [here](https://www.plastc.com/faqs), and while I'm at it, here's a [pretty picture](https://www.plastc.com/_themes/plastc/img/plastc-social-bg.jpg). I've seen a lot of skepticism about the feasibility of this card, often around the cost. As an engineer that designs devices at this scale, I'd like to provide some description on its cost, technology and security - the stuff they tend to avoid in their FAQ. Please comment and I'll update where I can. I have no affiliation with Plastc. I'm just an engineer that has built miniature and credit-card circuits. I have experience with many of the components in Plastc: firmware, microcontrollers, flexible circuits, lithium-polymer batteries, wireless charging, bluetooth and BLE, near-field communication, public-private key encryption, etc. As far as feasibility, they're already in production stages, so these are being produced in a \"mass production\" environment, but for promotional, testing and quality purposes. The real mass production happens this summer, when pre-orders being to ship. **Magnetic Stripe** The magnetic stripe on credit cards is simply a magnetizable material that has a pattern of norths and souths that represents your card number (and a few other pieces of info). If you could \"see\" magnetic fields, you could just copy the stripe by hand - there's no security to this mechanism on *any* credit card, so they all can be cloned easily. Plastc ships with an external card reader, and the hardware is then able to magnetize its own stripe identically. This is not crazy or new, lots of technology can steal and mimic a magnetic stripe, but I am impressed at Plastc's ability to do this without taking too much battery power. The cool thing about this is that the stripe is generated as needed by the software - this eliminates stripes wearing out, so Plastc ought to read perfectly every time, and unlike regular cards, Plastc ought to be immune to magnets. I have no idea what this technology costs. It's not cutting-edge, but it might require, a brute-force \"crapton\" of transistors, which are cheap. **EMV chip** In chip-and-pin credit cards, this is simply a [PPK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) encryption chip that holds a secret key that it never reveals. In simpler terms, the chip can answer an entire category of riddles - the card reader poses a riddle, the chip answers the riddle, thus proving it knows the \"secret\" to answering that kind of riddle, without ever giving away what that secret is. No other card ever knows this particular secret. The EMV chip can reveal some other public information, such as the card's bank and manufacturer. Because there is no way to read the secret from an EMV chip, Plastc can't clone these chips. The card-reader may read enough information about a bank to guide you to instructions on how to set it up, but ultimately the banking institutions would have to cooperate with Plastc on a secure way to get the secret into the card. This means that this capability will be hit-and-miss between banking institutions. They have *hinted* that they're pairing with Chase Bank and Bank Of America at minimum. The \"cost\" of this technology is very low - many microprocessors can implement this protocol in software, so we're looking at less than $5 put toward processor power. **NFC / Tap-and-go** The NFC communication is functionally similar to the EMV chip, but wireless up to about 4 inches. This is trivial technology to implement, although I'm sure it drives up the cost, and it carries the same issue of how to get the secret from the banking institution into Plastc. NFC is fairly expensive to implement though, requiring a pricey microchip as well a big coily shape of wire and possibly shielding to gather up and respond to the wireless field. $6 cost. **Rewards cards and building access cards** Because most rewards cards are just magnetic stripes, they are easily just mimicked. Some building access cards use NFC, and some of these don't use a \"secret\", but rather a plain password that Plastc can mimic immediately, such as most hotel room keys. For the better and more secure building access systems, Plastc would have to partner with those companies to, again, get the secret on to the Plastc card. Other near-field building access keycards use proprietary protocols that Plastc's hardware will never be able to mimic. **Battery and wireless charging** The card charges wirelessly, which is great because this eliminates all connectors and points of entry for dirt, dust and water. I assume (and hope) they're using the Qi standard, so finding places to charge, like in your car, is likely to get easier. The battery is definitely a lithium polymer, under 100mAh, probably closer to 15mAh. This kind of battery is very common, and at credit-card thickness it's flexible and will allow for at least 300 charges, and probably twice that, as long as it doesn't get too hot. I anticipate some minor heat problems though - heat is bad for battery longevity, and the battery has large, flat metals capable of turning wireless power into heat. The space seems WAY too tight to fit in proper shielding. Being able to run for a month at a time, the battery might outlast the concept of using credit cards to pay for things, even if the battery dies an \"early\" death. A battery this \"small\" might need some extra robustness, but shouldn't cost more than $5 each. **Bluetooth** Plastc communicates regularly to the cell phone, for programming, self-disabling and other maintenance tasks. Bluetooth is an expensive technology, and varies a lot by needs. Bluetooth Low Energy is supported by most phones now and is cheaper, and ANT is another (limiting) possibility they could have used. If they sourced creatively, it could be as little as $4 each, or as high as $16 to implement. Full Bluetooth also requires a computationally expensive software stack, adding $5 to the cost of the CPU. This might have required some creative engineering to fit in there, but it's quite doable. I expect they chose BLE because it is less expensive and very compatible. **E-Ink Touchscreen** I think this by far is the most impressive component. Flexible and durable screens are rare and probably difficult to manufacture, but they do exist and E-ink is an excellent choice. The screen is probably capacitive touch, as this is the most robust and smallest footprint, but it is very impressive that they got it to work in such a tight space with all of the other radio components and plastic. Another good feature of the e-Ink screen is that it is functionally indistinguishable from paper. This enables Plastc to emulate bar-code coupons, membership cards and travel tickets that can be read by *all* bar-code technology. Managing the display and touchscreen are probably the most processor-intense activities, bringing the total cost of the CPU alone probably around $12, and the e-ink screen might be the most expensive component in the device (I have no idea what it would cost though, maybe $15 or more). **Card balance display** Plastc is shown in advertisements to be able to display the balance on your card. This can only happen if Plastc has figured out how to interface with your bank (much like how Mint.com does) to get your balance. It may not work with all institutions, but if they did team up with a company like Mint (Intuit), this would enable them to do it for virtually every bank in existence. The data wirelessly bounces through your phone so it can be acquired from the internet. **The hard parts** I think actually the hardest part of this project is the software. The little CPU in the card not only has to be responsive for a month on a single small lithium battery, it's performing some fairly big display and encryption functions. I'm concerned about their promises regarding NFC and EMV not because of the hardware, but their ability to deliver software that achieves mimicry on top of all of the security these protocols require. The magnetic stripe is also an impressive piece of technology. Not because it's necessarily hard, but because it's novel - they most likely invented this technology entirely in-house, addressing signal strength and battery life. This is really the only piece that can't be found off-the-shelf. Because no standard microchip cases are thin enough for a credit card, Plastc definitely had to work with die-bonding (where the raw silicon for each technology is put on a thin, flexible circuit), and they may have even had to commission custom ICs. They e-ink screen is probably also custom. So the real challenge to manufacturing this is the cost of tooling - flexible circuits, custom ICs, die-bonding and custom screens are all very expensive to set up for mass-production, not to mention software development. Once they're mass-producing, each card probably has a manufacturing cost of under $50, although the tooling would likely be millions. They're going to have to sell *a lot* of cards before they see a profit, but once (and if) they do, they'll be making money hand over fist. This brings up a risk - for mimicing a magnetic stripe, the system ought to be autonomous, but where Plastc is partnering with banks, you may need Plastc to be the delegate for a lot of these transactions. This means that if Plastc goes out of business (and, being a start-up, their odds aren't good), some of the functionality may end up crippled. Still, the remaining features would be good enough for me. I'd be happy to answer questions on how the technologies work in the comments, or update this for accuracy.<tmiw>: &gt; Because there is no way to read the secret from an EMV chip, Plastc can't clone these chips. The card-reader may read enough information about a bank to guide you to instructions on how to set it up, but ultimately the banking institutions would have to cooperate with Plastc on a secure way to get the secret into the card. This means that this capability will be hit-and-miss between banking institutions. They have hinted that they're pairing with Chase Bank and Bank Of America at minimum. And that's why it's not a good idea to buy it right now. As you said, it will be useless for large numbers of people because some banks simply won't sign on. There's also the chance that BofA and Chase won't either, regardless of what Plastc \"hints\". OTOH, at least Plastc has a chance of working after EMV becomes common in the US. Coin has no plans to do EMV at all, still seemingly in denial that the US will ever adopt it and wrong about its implications. (At one point they were saying that chip and signature cards would still work with Coin, but not chip and PIN. The data on the magstripe that forces the card to require insertion is not different between those.)<CJoshDoll>: You dont need Plastic to even support EMV, really, at least in the near term. All you have to do is clone the magstripe from your EMV card. All cards will carry both for the foreseeable future, for backwards compatibility. NO bank is going to turn stop issuing the magstripe until retailer adoption is near 100% and that is not going to be anytime soon. Many, if not most, EMV cards from nations that are on EMV, still have a magstripe, so that when you travel, the card still works. There is zero incentive for the banks to stop issuing the magstiipe, and 99% of retailers are not going to stop accepting it anytime soon. Plastic should be positioning themselves to bring on as many banks as possible, asap, for EMV, but in the meantime instruct a user to use the magstripe from the card for Plastic. Essentially in the setip guide it should be something like \"try emv, if it fails, notify us of the bank so we can get them on board. Skip to magstripe section of instructions.\" Payment methods that require the banks to be on board is a long process. I cant use apple pay because my bank isnt on board yet. Go after the big banks and get them on, then add smaller banks as requested. IMO it would be crucial to include something in the setup process that requires the customer interact with a Plastic owned system, so that they can demonstrate metrics to potential banks on how many users they have, and how many have requested bank \"xyz.\" That gives you a few ways to negotiate with banks. [talking to banks xyz] We have x users that wanted to add their \"xyz\" emv card, but you dont support it. Of those users, y number of them subsequently added an emv card from a bank that IS working with us, meaning you could be losing transactions to another bank, not just forcing the user to carry your card in addition to our device. Since the liability shift in Oct pertains to banks (issuers) and retailers only, a consumer isnt accepting any additional liability this way, at least not yet. You are correct on the chip &amp; pin vs chip &amp; sig, unless the spec has changed. The PIN (for EMV or for debit) is NOT on the card, so it doesnt matter, and the card's programming has nothing to do with the process flow when a pin or sig is involved, that all happens at the input / swipe device. (There /may/ be a flag on the card that shows it supports PIN, I cant remember how that is handled, but right now it doesnt matter because no one is turning PIN on in the readers.)<tmiw>: Up to 50% of retailers will have turned EMV on before the end of 2015, based on stuff I've heard. Once it's on, the terminal typically* won't allow swiping on chip-enabled cards any more. Depending on one's shopping habits and whether their issuer's replaced their card yet EMV could very well be the vast majority of their day to day spending. ^* If the terminal fails to read the chip multiple times in a single transaction there is something called \"fallback\" which will allow swipe. However, the issuer will be notified that this occurred and could end up still declining the card depending on their own internal policies.<CJoshDoll>: Yes and no. Very few retailers are going to turn off magstripe right away, too many people will not have EMV cards. I would be surprised at the 50% adoption rate. I might be able to see 50% of the total terminals support EMV, where you have a good portion of the major retailers upgraded, but 50% adoption based on the count of retailers I cannot see. My company isn't even bothering. The cost, if you don't already have terminals that support EMV, outweighs the risk for most. What and how is a whole other discussion. First, it depends on the hardware. Many card reader have a slot for EMV, and a slot for magstripe (in fact, most are this way, at least where I have seen them.) For those readers, nothing stops you from using magstripe, because the reader doesnt know that the card also has emv. Unless the banks are going to move to a fresh set of BIN codes (the portion of the card number that identifies who the issuing bank is), and reject magstripe when the auth is sent to the bank, I don't see how they will prevent you from using it. Even if that was the case, that means additional software coding that is required for each retailer's POS software. As far as what to do if they do have a chip card, and how to process, that is all left up to the retailer. The retailer has the option if the chip is broken to fail back to magstipe, or to refuse to, but that is the retailer's choice, and is written into their specific code for each swipe device. Most retailers that I have talked to have no plans to turn on \"refuse mag\" on EMV fail. There is a whole workflow around EMV, and those options are left to the retailer (other options like how to handle EMV+Pin/sig when a device doesnt have a sigpad or keypad like a self service kiosk.) The dreams that have been touted as EMV being the silver bullet for fraud is just a joke. It is only trivially harder to clone an emv card, because all you need is the magstripe data and a card with a broken chip. Not to mention there are WAY better solutions to prevent most card present fraud, and post transaction breaches.) Back to the Plastic implementation, all you would need is to support cloning the magstripe if Plastic hasnt added the bank for EMV yet, and have the Plastic device \"turn off\" the EMV chip for those transactions, so that the card reader at the retailer never knows the card was issued with EMV. Again, short of additional checks put in place for the retailer to check if a transaction should have supported EMV, nothing else will fail. Now, if banks are going to refuse magstripe transactions unless you call in and tell them your chip broke, and they allow magstripe until a new card is issued, then I dont see where the issue would be. And I just dont see that happening anytime soon. The whole reason that EMV is being implemented with signature instead of the FAR more secure PIN, is that banks / issuers were afraid people would not use their cards and use a card that doesnt require PIN. You have to remember that every transaction makes the issuer money, and they dont want to do ANYTHING that could cause them to lose transactions, even in the name of saving fraud.<tmiw>: No one is even thinking of turning magstripe off. For one thing, no one is planning on putting chips in things like gift cards any time soon. What will change is that chip-enabled cards can't be swiped any more at places that have turned on their chip slots. I don't buy that places are still going to allow swipe when there's a chip unless the chip itself is broken, simply because that opens them up to the liability they were hoping to avoid. Also, at least around here, a ton of major retailers have the new touchscreen Verifone or Ingenico terminals. They are probably waiting until October to turn EMV on, because otherwise why else would they upgrade? If it was solely to turn on Apple Pay/NFC there are cheaper options that they could have done instead. Hell, Best Buy for example already had NFC capable readers that they could have simply turned back on but instead installed new Ingenico ones. While it's likely the case that smaller places will take a lot longer, most people probably use their cards more often at larger retailers so chip will possibly end up being used often almost right away. * * * Back to Plastc. While they could change the service code so that chip isn't mandated any more, stores do send the full track data to issuers when running transactions. It's highly doubtful banks would not notice that the sent data is different than expected and simply decline the card as a result. If they were going to allow Plastc to change the service code, then they probably would have allowed them to implement EMV for their cards in the first place.<CJoshDoll>: As far as the huge retailers, absolutely they will turn on EMV, but outside of them, it is going to be hit or miss. The readers are not the only cost. At a minimum, you also have the development costs for your POS software, as most, out of the box, are not setup for EMV, and each POS software is generally further customized by an integration partner, which includes turning EMV on, its not just a switch you flip. On the other side of that is companies that are abandoning the traditional POS system for card transactions, and the reader itself holds the POS application for cards and then sends the completed transaction data to the register's POS application. Verifone offers this as their Point product (I believe Target may have goine to Point), and this incurs the integration costs already mentioned, but also incurs additional costs per year from Verifone for the solution, and EMV is an additional cost. In most cases, there is also a licensing cost to Verifone / Ingenico terminals to enable EMV as well. So retailers are running those numbers, looking at the costs, and comparing them to their card present fraud numbers - if your fraud is less than the yearly cost for EMV, why bother? (This is exactly the position we found ourselves in, and we have opted to only roll out EMV for new stores.) The issue on allowing mag transactions when there is a chip, again, comes down to hardware. A lot of readers dont use the same slot for both, thus, unless there are additional measures put in place, the reader would have no way to know that the card swiped for mag, even had a chip. Certainly this can be prevented with some additional steps during authorization when the bank responds back with a denial because chip wasn't used. I have not yet seen this type of implementation, but granted, I only know what our bank is doing, and those that I have talked to in the industry. That also goes back to why couldnt Plastic just disable the chip when you select to use a card you have added for mag where the bank didnt support the chip with Plastic, or even emulate a broken chip. The only real issue I see here, is that /could/ leave Plastic open to liability issues later, but I would think the number of fraudulent transactions using a Plastic device would be quite low, unless criminals started using it as a way around EMV. At the end of the day, I am not sure what Plastic is really capable of, and any solution to deal with EMV short of acceptance from the issuing bank, could be a crap shoot. But like I said previously, retailers and banks are not in the business of refusing transactions, because they lose money. And during the transition to EMV, there will be a lot of gaps, because you are going to HAVE to allow mag transactions because of the slow adoption rate. EMV just annoys the shit out of me. Its NOT the answer people think it is. You can reduce almost all card present breaches with end to end encryption to protect the card data from reader to bank, and use tokenization as the response from the bank, so that the retailer never sees or stores a card number. This would have prevented Target, Home Depot, Sally Beauty, etc, because the malware would have never seen a card number. EMV is really a solution for authentication, not a solution for protecting card data.<tmiw>: &gt; The issue on allowing mag transactions when there is a chip, again, comes down to hardware. A lot of readers dont use the same slot for both, thus, unless there are additional measures put in place, the reader would have no way to know that the card swiped for mag Issuers are *required* by the card brands to set the first digit of the service code on the magnetic stripe to 2 (\"International interchange, use IC (chip) where feasible\" [according to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card)) when issuing chip-enabled cards. Terminals use that mechanism to force insertion of such cards when swiped and don't need to contact the bank for that. Enforcement of this can be disabled and is for the time being at some stores but I don't see that continuing past October due to the increased liability that would result. Plastc (and Samsung Pay when it finally comes out) would need to send magnetic stripe data that doesn't have '2' for the first digit of the service code in order for the terminal to allow swiping/MST. Without some sort of deal with the issuer, the terminal will send that full modified magstripe data on, service code and all, which the bank would easily detect and should probably decline. If they do make some sort of deal, I would imagine there would be some sort of tokenized card number as well to easily be able to tell if something other than the real card was used and to allow them to keep that track data check I mentioned earlier for the physical card. As for EMV's usefulness, maybe. P2PE has significant costs as well though and most places will probably end up having to implement EMV-capable terminals anyway to get it because our infrastructure is that old.<CJoshDoll>: Awesome, learned something new today! In the short term, I still dont think retailers or banks are going to decline on swipe, in fact, I dont even know if the bank could do it, because that would require sending information in the authorization to tell the bank that the terminal is EMV capable &amp; enabled, so it would fall on the retailer. While I can see the adoption of refusing mag at the reader when the card is chip capable being higher than refusing mag on broken chip, I still don't see a high adoption, at least early on (the first year or two), which would give Plastic time to bring on plenty of banks if they were able to add a card as mag when they dont have an agreement for EMV in place with the issuing bank yet. Granted, my belief in that low adoption is anecdotal, but it is based on my experiences here and discussions with other retailers. I can see high volume, large retailers declining mag when chip capable, but I just dont see others jumping in to force chip use, yet. Retailers are scared shitless of upsetting a customer. I think it would be much more likely that you see transactions based on certain criteria forced to chip if possible (over $x, gift cards, etc). The liability factor is much lower than you would think. The only place liability changes is when a card is used that was stolen from the owner of the card. That fraud certainly exists, but in lower numbers than you would think, and again it depends on the retailer and if their yearly fraud numbers are greater than the implementation cost. You are absolutely correct that E2E is costly, and more costly than enabling EMV, and that pisses me off. With all the money the issuers are spending sending out new cards and implementing new EMV systems, they could have provided E2E as a default. The real costs in E2E are the per transaction costs that the bank charges, which is Fing ridiculous IMO. If the banks wanted fraud to stop, they would just make it the default, but they dont, because they dont actually hold the liability, because they just pass the fraud costs back onto the customers, so they have NO motivation to do better. Hence why, if we are going to mandate something with regulations, it shouldve been E2E, IMO. While there are certainly plenty of older devices that would need replacing, far more non-EMV capable terminals support E2E. Hell, I'd be okay with EMV, if they would have rolled E2E into the mandate. My issue isnt really with EMV, its that it has been touted as THE answer, when it is NOT.<tmiw>: We'll see how many actually turn chip support on by the end of the year. Visa/MC seem pretty serious about EMV in any case. The US becoming the only country where they had to mandate it due to extremely high resistance (as in, terminals that only support magstripe would be unable to even connect to the acquirer) would be a dubious honor and could cause lots of small businesses to revert to being cash only. Plastc could be useful for the time being for some, especially smaller banks and CUs who haven't even bothered with EMV yet. I'm definitely an outlier since all of my cards have EMV on them now.<CJoshDoll>: I don't think you will see acquirers dropping magstripe for at least 10 years. Until we reach the point of 95-98% adoption by retailers, no way they are going to give up those transactions. Were so far behind, because we are running on old tech, and we are running on old tech, because of the liability model. Consumers and retailers arent liable for fraud, neither are the banks, the card brands and issuers cover it. But they dont actually eat those costs, they pass it back to the consumers in other ways. So at this point, there is no real motivation for anyone to spend the money to protect the data. The only reason EMV is getting a sudden adoption is because they shifted the liability for fraud that could have been prevented by EMV. And, IMO, that isnt even a settled issue, and isnt going to be, until a lawsuit happens at some point between an issuer and retailer over what \"would have been prevented by EMV\" really means.", "num_messages": 11, "avg_score": 1.3636363636}

I recognize that this is an important issue to you, and I welcome the opportunity to share my point of view. As you may be aware, on May 26, 2011, Congress passed, with strong bi-partisan support, legislation to extend three expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act \u2013 known as \"roving wiretaps,\" \"lone wolf,\" and \"business records\" provisions \u2013 until June 1, 2015 (Pub. L. 112-14). It is important to note that all three of these authorities can only be used after being approved by a federal judge. These provisions do the following: Roving wiretaps \u2013 before this authority was established, warrants could only be issued for a specific phone number. In the modern age of telecommunications, terrorists were able to evade surveillance simply by switching phones, which is easily done with throwaway cell phones. Thus, the \"roving wiretap\" authority simply authorizes a judge to issue a surveillance order that is specific to the suspect terrorist, rather than specific to a particular phone number. Lone wolf \u2013 the lone wolf provision allows for court-ordered surveillance of foreigners who engage in international terrorism but for whom an association with a specific international terrorist group has not yet been determined. Business records \u2013 finally, Section 215, or the business records section, allows the government to obtain business records relating to a suspected terrorist if it receives a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This provision also provides the legal authority for the National Security Agency to receive information about phone calls (the phone numbers and the time and length of the call), pursuant to a court order. In the interest of making sure these provisions can't be abused, on November 18, 2014, I joined 57 of my Senate colleagues in voting to bring the USA FREEDOM Act to the Senate Floor for amendment and debate. This bill would have reauthorized these provisions in modified form. Unfortunately, it did not receive enough votes to overcome a filibuster, but I am committed to working with my colleagues in the new Congress to pass similar legislation to extend and reform these provisions, especially Section 215, before they expire in June of this year. I understand your concerns that these authorities may be misused. As Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have seen how United States intelligence and law enforcement agencies have used these authorities, and I have come to believe that these programs are legal, properly controlled, and have not been widely abused. I take seriously my responsibility as Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee and will continue to vigorously pursue oversight over these programs by working to verify that these programs are conducted legally and with the proper safeguards. Again, thank you for taking the time to write. Your feedback on this subject is important to me, and I will keep it in mind as the Senate continues further extensions of the programs authorized by the USA PATRIOT Act. If you have any additional comments or questions, please do not hesitate to contact my Washington, D.C. office at (202) 224-3841.

It inflates the price of the product because they have to get their cut, which could be anything from 1%-100% of the value of the vehicle.

Look at the whole picture, there are service shops/galleries/superchargers everywhere that it is prudent to be. <yantando>: I have absolutely nothing to do with car dealerships, I just see the need for people to be able to get recalls taken care of or their car repaired if it breaks. Once again I'm not actually worried about Tesla, I'm worried about some other new brand that maybe sells cheap cars factory direct. One that Average Joe may consider purchasing. Look at that map and show only service centers. There are entire regions where you'd be fucked if you needed dealer service.<interestingsidenote>: Is a calculated risk you take. Tesla isn't for the common man until the cost to produce lowers. It's akin to computers 25 years ago, there were few shops that could fix one because it was a fledgling technology. A lot of the resistance seems to stem from the fact that opponents can't be bothered to look 5-10 years in the future. <yantando>: Let's take your advice and look 5-10 years in the future. The country gets hyped up because they love Musk and Tesla and does away with dealership laws. Now there are 10 car companies selling direct with absolutely no infrastructure to handle a mass recall. Queue everybody understanding why the first dealership laws were past in the first place. And btw, these newer cars are run by software \"protected\" by DMCA, meaning for some issues it's illegal for you or anybody else to fix without authorized approval from the manufacturer. Do I like that? Hell no, but that's reality.<interestingsidenote>: I'm super happy that you think perpetuating the car dealership model is a good thing. It's not, but I'm happy you feel that way. When my Saab, Pontiac, Chevy, Cadillac, Oldsmobile or Honda needed to go in there was no way in hell they were being taken to a dealership. They all went to the *same certified mechanic* that i've used for the last 15 years. He is certified to perform warranty and recall work on any of those models. Seriously, fuck car dealerships. As far as your worry about DMCA goes, uncertified work has always been the best way to void your warranty for most anything. Open your xbox and break that shiny seal? Warranty void. <yantando>: Where you gonna take your car if there is a recall? You know exactly where you're going and you'll be damn happy that it's near you rather than 3 states away.<interestingsidenote>: Dude, what don't you get about Tesla vehicles being new tech? What don't you get about them avoiding states they are blocked from selling because it's not in their interest if the state governments are against them? I swear, some people fail to understand simple economics sometimes and its mind boggling. They taught supply and demand in grade school where I'm from. an edit to your edit in your OP: you're being downvoted because you're being short-sighted, not because you are spouting the rationale used. Proponents understand it, it's dumb.<yantando>: Dude, what don't you get about Tesla not being the only company that would be able to sell direct if they get the laws changed? Are you that short-sighted? People are willing to get rid of a consumer-protection law for a god damn luxury car, it's insanity. I get you don't like the dealer sales process, neither do I, which is why I used a car buying service last time I bought a new car.

Here, let me remove that rock you've been hiding underneath. ITunes initially had drm protecting their content. Then you could pay more to not have drm. That alone shows they didn't have the model Right. What if I don't want to use iTunes to play my media? What if I don't have an iPod / iPhone / iPad / Mac? What happens to the content I download from iTunes. It's useless. So no, iTunes didn't get it right and didn't change the model. Amazon came much closer. Good try, bud. Do your homework. <ossga>: What rock are *you* living under big dog? iTunes, Amazon and countless others provide DRM-free MP3s that I can play anywhere. <DeeJayMaps>: NOW. iTunes didn't at first. And the content is still walled in the apple. Unless I'm Savvy, it's not easy to pull the MP3 or MP4 out of iTunes to use on another player or add to an android device. That's the fucking problem. This is why iTunes isn't enough. I'm truly failing to see the disconnect here. That's not to mention that iTunes doesn't have everything. It has limits to what content it has.

You are also double taxing people for their household electricity use and driving gas driven vehicles. I'd be pretty pissed to get double taxed like that. I know everyone here is complaining about this, but I actually think they should find a way to put something similar to a gas tax for electric vehicles. They use the roads, but are essentially not paying their fair share for road maintenance. If not taxation, maybe they could find a better way to fund road repairs. In Wa state, it is a very big issue. Roads and bridges are shit here and funding never seems to be able to keep up. People running studs from fall to spring doesn't help things either.<spammeaccount>: They are already paying tax on the electricity, the EXTRA electricity to power their car. The costs for the road maintenance comes from general funding anyway not just from gas taxes. In some places the cost of electricity is 50% taxes already.<Geawiel>: Even paying taxes on the extra electricity to charge, you still can't just say home A is using however much more electricity to charge. It isn't like you can tell where the electricity is going in the household. How are they to know they aren't just using more electricity from something else and not charging a vehicle? If you are going to levy a charging tax, there has to be a way to accurately tax those with electric vehicles not only at home but at off site charging stations. Does the business pay the tax in the case of work site stations? Does the employee using the charger pay the tax? How do you track the power usage for the charging station and only the charging station? All of that complication is eliminated with a mileage tax, instead of a charging or gas tax.

This is something that I'm genuinely worried about. How do all of you overcome your fears of AI taking over the world? <verumquaerenti>: AI is program, regardless how complex it can be, it is still will be an application which operates based on some rules. Back in old days, [Isaac Asimov come up with Three Laws of Robotics:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics) * A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. * A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. * A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws. We just need to remember to use them.<irhymeslow>: Right, but the worry is not in that a single application will take over the world. It's that the application will be able to rewrite itself and make changes to itself. If it can change itself, it can modify or remove any \"rules\" you put into it. <verumquaerenti>: Think about it: Computer use RAM and ROM, in old days ROM cannot be reprogrammed, but ROM is still instructions which defines behavior accessing to peripherals, CPU and memory. ROM is responsible for loading application, rules for AI can be the same. Btw in the movie it was a lot of inconsistencies: Nathan managed to create very sophisticated AI, and build up serious security, but have not programmed to AI rules preventing to harm humans. Also, safety measures of the house do not consider possibilities to get trapped. If AI had such sophistication, it could manipulate with security on its own.<irhymeslow>: I'm not talking about the movie. It all comes down to addressing and values stores at addresses which yes execute defined instructions on your given architecture. So I don't see the instruction set being modified but the program code or values stored in memory can totally be modified. Even if it wasn't on the fly, if the application had a copy of it's own code it could modify and recompile another version of itself and run it.<verumquaerenti>: you understand that future AI, will not be regular instruction set, as we have today. So, self-reprogramming would not be possible by definition. Evolving and principles of development would be similar to our brain functions, at least modern technology trying to model from it, recent bee brain model good example of it. But in any case any steps of further development will be in controlled environment. As for movie, I specifically referenced it, because entire idea that AI out of control comes from the movie which cannot pass any reasonable scrutiny by security, usability, safety etc.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 0.8333333333}

The holodeck recreates 3D holograms that you can view from all angles. We haven't even gotten that bit down, we can't even make color moving holograms yet. In addition, the holodeck warps the optics inside the room so that two people can walk away from each other and appear to be a football field away from one another despite being in a 30x30 room. It replicates things like food and water so that when you try to eat an apple you're not biting into a forcefield. It does the treadmill thing by putting a thin forcefield on the floor of the room which it then moves around. Additionally, the hardest thing that it does and is often overlooked is recreating characters that can flawlessly pass the Turing test, and on numerous occasions, have even achieved true sentience.<Anjin>: Not just holograms though, physical things you can touch and interact with.<Rentun>: In Star Trek, they're holograms.

There are two phones, one has a bigger (capacity) battery than the other, but due to hardware, OS efficiency, etc, they both last the same amount of time on a full charge. I'd take the phone with the smaller (lower capacity) battery because it'll last the same amount of time with less time to charge fully. Like, say you have a choice between two remarkably similar cars that both go 300 miles on a tank. Do you get the more efficient car with the smaller tank, or the gas guzzler that's more expensive to fill up?<PatrickLudgate>: You picked a phone purely on battery size?

They're talking about comparing phones that have comparable performance, but one at 0.5 watts of draw per hour, and the other with 0.4 watts of draw per hour. The smaller battery, with the smaller phone, would perform the same functionality, and take 20% less time/energy to charge up. Is such paring of phones possible presently? No. But it's the equivalent to getting an 1989 Ford F150 to a 2014 Ford F150. They both have lots of power, lots of payload capacity, both get you where you're going, but one is significantly more efficient. Which would you choose, the one that gets [up to 17mpg Highway](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/1989_Ford_F150_Pickup.shtml) or the one that gets [19mpg city, 26mpg highway](http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2014/11/24/ford-new-f-150-to-get-26-mpg-tops-among-pickups/)? <PatrickLudgate>: You analogy does not make sense for phone batteries.

No, the LED TVs have less draw, *despite being bigger and better quality*<PatrickLudgate>: What the fuck is your deal? Why are you comparing two different things? This is about comparing the same exact thing. This is what you are actually saying \"An LED TV with a 52 inch screen can somehow use less power than an LED TV with a 52 inch screen with a smaller battery.\" No that clearly does not make any fucking sense.

I'm pretty sure I do, but feel free to enlighten me on how spending 4 kWh to dry a load of laundry is impossible on a 10 kWh battery.<MadMargarine>: Oh i didn't realize you were in the industry. You undoubtedly know the difference between peak and continuous load. If a dryer consumes 4kW then it wouldn't work with a battery that's rated at 2kWh continuous because its using 4kWh. I'm a little fuzzy on it because I work with mainly alternating current, but that's usually the way it goes. Peak power is a terrible metric to go by because that's what it can put out momentarily.<MartinSchou>: How do you use \"2 kWh continuous\"? Let's assume for a moment that you meant 2 kW and 4 kW (power usage) and not kWh (energy usage). What the fuck kind of home dryer are you using, that draws 4 kW from the wall? Did you steal an industrial dryer to use at home?<MadMargarine>: 2kwh continuous is the battery's max output<MartinSchou>: &gt; 2kwh continuous is the battery's max output No it is not. The battery's maximum output is 7 kWh without being continuously recharged. kWh is a measurement of energy - not power. 2 kWh is 7.2 megajoules. 2 kW is 2,000 joules/second. The two are not in any way equivalent or comparable, and you can't have a \"continuous maximum output of 7.2 megajoule\". [The Tesla Powerwall can supply 2 kW continuous and 3.3 kW peak.](http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall)<MadMargarine>: Look, the original article specifies 2kWh continuous. So a 7kwh battery could output 2kW for 3.5 hours. If you apply a continuous load of more than 2kW, you're going to wreck the battery. Don't confuse yourself bringing joules into it. Peak 3.3 kW means it can output that for 30 seconds or less. <Source>: electrician<MartinSchou>: &gt; Look, the original article specifies 2kWh continuous. No it does not. The article uses the word continuous twice: &gt; Continuous Power: 2 kW &gt; For utility scale systems, 100kWh battery blocks are grouped to scale from 500kWh to 10MWh+. These systems are capable of 2hr or 4hr continuous net discharge power using grid tied bi-directional inverters. kW and kWh are not and never will be the same. &gt; Source: electrician That's not exactly comforting. It's entirely possible and plausible that you made a simple mistake the first time around, which is why I wrote &gt; Let's assume for a moment that you meant 2 kW and 4 kW (power usage) and not kWh (energy usage). But it's now the third time that you insist that kW and kWh are equivalent. Either you are being obstinate because you refuse to admit that you made a perfectly innocent mistake the first time around, or you genuinely do not know the difference between kW and kWh, and that's a scary prospect for someone who works as an electrician. &gt; Peak 3.3 kW means it can output that for 30 seconds or less. Yes ... and after 30 seconds of outputting 3.3 kW, the battery has discharged a grand total of 0.0275 kWh. To output 2 kWh at 3.3 kW, the battery would have to be discharging for a total of 36 minutes and 21 seconds.<MadMargarine>: When did I say that kW is the same as kWh? Reread. I didn't. I used 4kW as an estimate of a dryers' power draw (its closer to about 3.6kW @ 240v 15A). A load of laundry takes about an hour so I said it uses about 4kWh of energy. I'm not \"insisting\" those are the same. In the past ten years I've probably wired millions and millions of dollars worth of industrial equipment and never burned up a single device. So easy on the insults. What's your background?<MartinSchou>: &gt; When did I say that kW is the same as kWh You started out with: &gt; [Continuous Power: 2kW Peak Power: 3kW It takes around 4kWh to dry a load of laundry. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/34hbaq/tesla_introduces_tesla_energy_a_suite_of/cqv4zm3) So far so good. You then followed it up with: &gt; [If a dryer consumes 4kW then it wouldn't work with a battery that's rated at 2kWh continuous because its using 4kWh.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/34hbaq/tesla_introduces_tesla_energy_a_suite_of/cqvo2bq) That's where you made the initial mistake, and this is where I assumed that you made a simple mistake. Then you said &gt; [2kwh continuous is the battery's max output.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/34hbaq/tesla_introduces_tesla_energy_a_suite_of/cqw3fv7) In other words, I am very much capable of reading what you wrote? An electrician mixing up kW and kWh is like a mechanic who says his car can do 120 mph/gallon. Everyone can make typos or small mistakes. That's why I made the assumption that you didn't mean \"2 kWh continuous\" but \"2 kW continuous\", but then you insisted that you hadn't made a mistake.<MadMargarine>: Okay I see where I added the \"h\". I mentally changed it 2kWh because at 2kW that's the maximum output over an hour. Sorry. So if a dryer pulls 3.6kW as a continuous load, and the battery is rated 2kW continuous, can you run the dryer on the battery without ruining it?<MartinSchou>: &gt; So if a dryer pulls 3.6kW as a continuous load, and the battery is rated 2kW continuous, can you run the dryer on the battery without ruining it? No. Obviously not, though I'm not sure the battery would even try to supply 3.6 kW, given that its peak is 3.3 kW. The question is, will the dryer continue working if the battery is smart enough to only supply 2 kW, is the battery dumb enough to be burned out by this configuration or are the electricians installing these units smart enough to point this out to the customers and get them to buy low power devices? For example, instead of using 4 kWh to dry a load of clothes, you could get something like an AEG T97689IH3. That's a 5 amp, 230 volt dryer which will use about 1.5 kWh to dry a full load (8 kg). Want more choices? How about a Siemens iQ500, with a 1,000 watt rated dryer which uses 1.93 kWh do dry a full load (8 kg)? Sure, it'd be nice if you could continue to just use your old wasteful devices, but then you're pretty much just hitching your 25 foot camper to your Renault Twizy and wondering why you can't get out of the driveway and why the family can't fit in the car.<MadMargarine>: Obviously not? That's not what you said yesterday. Fair enough, they make 120v dryers, too, it just takes a longer time to dry your clothes. Its a different story if you design your entire house around the battery. You would be better off buying multiple batteries and wiring them in parallel. If the battery can't supply what the dryer uses, there's a good chance you're going to smoke the motor inside the dryer from under-voltage. You can say electricians are stupid, but at the end of the day, you would've burned up the customers brand new battery and possibly the dryer's motor.<MartinSchou>: &gt; Obviously not? That's not what you said yesterday. Because yesterday I hadn't checked and seen that the vast majority of dryers on the market are all rated at well above what the battery is capable of supplying. I am honestly flummoxed that dryers use that much power. That's not even a dig at Americans - I checked ones available in Europe, and we also have quite a few rated at 3.6 kW and insane energy requirements. It's like being used to a European hatchback getting 55 mpg and then seeing that a Hummer H1 in the hands of Jeremy Clarkson gets 1 - it's so absurd it wouldn't even cross your mind. &gt; You can say electricians are stupid, but at the end of the day, you would've burned up the customers brand new battery and possibly the dryer's motor. Which is why the batteries are installed by people who hopefully know what they're doing. I'm just used to having low power devices that can easily run off of these batteries, provided they can be used in a European 240 volt household.<MadMargarine>: I know here in the States a good solution is to use a combination electric/propane dryer.

The data is still on the disk, but the computer no longer knows where it is. Sometimes it's possible to recover the majority of the data. In order to *actually* delete the data you need to do what's called \"zeroing\" the drive, or even better: overwrite it with random data.", "num_messages": 10, "avg_score": 195.4}

Didn't think so.<someidiot1998>: Lol were talking about a laptop without a GPU. That will have a hard time running flash games at that resolution. And sorry to tell you but the battery life isn't that long. Maybe it is on standby. Apple doesn't give a shit about performance or user experience.

Reviews even show more than 12 hours. That link is a 15\" laptop. I said 13\". If you want to compare 15\" the resolution is 2880x1800, processor i7-4980HQ, 2GB GDDR5 GPU, weight 2.02kg.<someidiot1998>: That was the closest I could find.

The majority of people want a light weight high performance laptop with a battery that lasts more a few hours and Lenovo sacrificed all that. The other guy said Apple sold \"overpriced low spec\" products and I asked who else can make a light weight laptop with the same battery life and high performance. So by definition they're not \"overpriced\" or \"low spec\" since nothing even comes close. Then you linked a heavy, bulkier laptop with terrible battery life and a weaker processor?<IMelted>: Battery life on that laptop is great as long as you are not gaming on it constantly, my friend owns it and it lasts him the whole day, even more if he doesn't game very much. Why would anybody pay 1200 for a shitty laptop, where the internals are the size of a raspberry pi. I'd rather buy a raspberry pi and put it in a thin laptop shell with a monitor and a battery than use that laptop - It would be just as good in everyday tasks, a hell of alot cheaper and you don't need an i7 to browse the internet. The moment you try to play a game on the Mac it would shit itself and get 30 fps on Minecraft.<tilzin>: The Lenovo gets less than 4 hours just web browsing. Nowhere near all day. I don't know what your Raspberry Pi rant is about. The fact is nobody else can make a light weight high performance laptop with longer battery life.<IMelted>: I wouldn't call something without a dedicated graphics chip high performance.<tilzin>: Like I said, it has a 2GB GDDR5 GPU.

That concept can be expanded to complete thought vectors, the angle between \"I went to the store\" and \"I'm going to the store\" would be small, deviating in past/future dimensions, but similar in dimensions involving subject, intention, and location. Symbolism, allusion, cultural context, all of them should (in theory) be able to be captured as directions (probably thousands of them) in n-dimensional space. In practice, you could give it one sentence, and it could tell you a negation of that sentence.

Just pointing out that there are two sides to this story. I am for more open boarders. Probably, even open boarders like some other countries have.<Mr_Majestyk>: I am of the opposite opinion. Legal immigration only, select only the best and brightest applying for entry. Ask anyone here illegally to leave. If they don't leave, show them the door. <NSA_Is_Listening>: I guess I don't understand why you wouldn't want people to be in your country that want to be here. What do we have to lose from gaining more people that arguably love the U.S. more than it's own citizens?<Mr_Majestyk>: If you are legally seeking entry into the country it can be safely assumed that they want to be here. I would like an interview process for applicants/legal immigrants so we can have new people helping the country. What I don't want is free loading law breaking criminals sneaking in and squatting...aka our current system of open borders.<NSA_Is_Listening>: We don't have open boarders. If we had open boarders, people wouldn't have to sneak in. Having open boarders means that anyone can come and leave as they would like. The people you are trying to keep out are not the type of people that you can reasonably keep out. If you put force field around our boarders they would gain access through other means. Your system sounds exactly like the one we have. There is an application process or if you want you can hop the boarder and get here quicker, without a paper trail. <Mr_Majestyk>: People can come and go as they please. Why do we have an estimated 10-20 million illegal aliens here if we didn't have open borders? I don't blame them for coming here by the way. But look at why they come. Because they are subsidised and welcomed. Everything is free... If you stopped giving them free everything they would not come here. The type of person that sneaks into the country is the type of person that has no problem committing a crime to better himself. That is not my first choice of immigrant. <NSA_Is_Listening>: Okay, clearly we are not using the same definition of open boarders. Our boarders are not open because we don't welcome everyone in. Sweden has open boarders. We try to stop people from getting in. Just because we are terrible at it doesn't make them open. There really is no good way to completely close the boardera. You will always have people finding a way in. With closed boarders you only keep out people that have respect for laws and rules. A lot of people come to this country for many reasons. I doubt a significant amount come to freeload. We have much better opportunities than many other countries. I expect many people from other countries have many great ideas and we should welcome them. Were our views depart is that you would like to keep out the badies. Well, who wouldn't. However, it is not possible to keep them out and in general a waste of time to filter them. If we had your idea, which is what we have now, we would have a long list of applicants and those we denied would either be not badies or people that will come illegally anyway. It's just a waste of time and resources to try the impossible.<Mr_Majestyk>: Tldr below. I do think we can close our borders. It doesn't involve a wall. It involves passing sensible immigration laws. For example: anyone illegally trespassing in the united states will be given medical attention and a free ride to the nearest international border. It will be a felony offence to illegally trespass in the united states. Convicted felons may not apply for US citizenship or any other permit to enter the country. Illegal aliens will not be permitted to work or attend school and may not legally be in possession of american currency (felony offence). Any employer currently employing an illegal will have a period to train and employ american workers. Thereafter they will face ridiculous fines if caught breaking the law(felony offence?). Sounds pretty extreme I know. But it sounds damned unappealing to someone who is considering coming here. Jeeze, if I sneak in there and get caught I will ruin my chance of ever going there legally. I won't be able to work or go to school or be eligible for any service. Perhaps I will just stay here and try to fix my shit hole country...for my kid's sake. I know realistically it will never happen. But my idea is far from what is going on now. We have a system where people eventually sneak in and take what they can. I have seen it first hand from Houston to Boston and many places in between. It is tremendously disconcerting when you see a car full of likely foreign nationals roll past the police and throw out a bag of McDonalds trash and the cop doesn't do a thing because they are driving around without a license plate. The cop said something like. \"We can pick them up and arraign them. Then they get released and change their name.\".a waste of time. Its a busted system that will buckle. Look at what's happening now. Amnesty is not the answer. I know the h1b visas suck. But amnesty for hundreds of thousands or millions of largely unskilled or uneducated (law breakers) new people in a country that is staggering with debt and unemployment is not the answer either. And what is going on in Sweden (great Briton, France, Germany, Italy, etc...) with their open borders? Aren't they having huge immigration problems with the rise of nationalistic sentiment due to unchecked immigration (particularly from the middle east) and the ridiculous demands that the immigrants put on the host? <Tldr>: I disagree and think there are other solutions than doing nothing about our immigration or worse....open borders. Too bad all we have in government (both parties)are corrupt lawyers. <NSA_Is_Listening>: Um, I think you are right about some things here. The European Union have open boarders between EU citizens. Sweden (not part of the EU) just have open boarders. I'm not really concerned with terrorists or others coming into the US because they can already get in. It's not that hard. There isn't much you can do with someone even if you make it a felony to come illegally. Again, you are only going to stop the people that want to come here legally. Also, it will not have a large affect, since for many it's a riskier situation to go back to Mexico. Likely they will be beaten or killed or came because here because of the amount of crime and risk of death there. You can't just drop them off in Canada. That's not really going to work out well for US Canadian relations. So, you have two choices if they repeatedly cross the boarder illegally (and why wouldn't they). Send them back to Mexico where they would just come back anyway or put them in jail and waste tax money on that. I'm also almost 100% sure that allowed to work here or attend school here anyway. Your ideas are fine but they are continuation of what is going on now anyway. There really isn't much you can do about them coming in. If you want a compromise, the only thing that would help the issue now is to make it 5000% easier to get into the country quickly. I'm not too worried about jobs or them using benefits that we pay for. As you said they are already here. If you make it easier and quicker to get in, they will be taxed like everyone else and add to the economy and pay for whatever benefits we have. They will also probably send less money to relatives in Mexico, since their relatives will likely be here. (I think the biggest or second biggest import into Mexico is US money sent from relatives?) So, I think we both agree with that compromise. I don't see any reason to not let anyone in and out as they please, though. It's also unfair to say they are unskilled, since many have skills and unskilled labor is still labor. It's still needed until our robot overlords get here.<Mr_Majestyk>: I like the way you think and appreciate the respectful, thoughtful replies. I do not like the idea of losing the country to foreign invaders. I am not talking about Mexico in particular, but lets look at that case. If we allow uncontrolled influx of Mexicans into the USA we will become as much a shit hole country as Mexico. First mass migration (and diseases that were eradicated in the USA long ago like polio), then amnesty (because shit they are already here), do a majority assimilate or even want to? no. Then, lets let them vote. What happens next? They vote for what they are here for...more services. Lets now add in the rest of central and south america and the Caribbean, Africa, eastern Europe, Asia etc. I guess you are correct because open borders means that eventually the whole planet will be one equal cesspool. Not a place i would care to live. Let the robots have it. I would say that if they are native Canadians, you can drop them off in Canada. If not, drop them off anyway because they had to come through canadian ports and the Canadian government is responsible for them. I am also not talking about terrorists or criminals in general because they will always find a way to strike if determined enough. I am talking about the people who move here and have no interest in becoming american (assimilation). They just want to rape the land. Open borders between states or even countries is ideal...for legal passage of citizens of commerce. I would also argue that asking UPS and or FedEx to set up a bus logistics system to return convicted felons to the country of origin would be cheaper than paying for a lifetime of subsidizing an illegal immigrant couple, their kids, aunts, uncles, cousins, neighbors, etc...look we have enough deadbeat layabout (natural born) citizens here already we don't need to import them. To be clear, i know that there are hardworking, and caring people that come here illegally that do want to do the right thing; people that have something to offer, even if they are unskilled and can only do manual labor. If i were in their situation i would risk my life to come to the USA to give and opportunity to my kids. I don't blame them at all. But our system is unsustainable now. We need to have rule of law. The most pissed off person i ever talked to about illegals was a Guatemalan guy that joined the Marines and became a citizen afterward. He is disgusted when he sees what illegals are doing in his own city, because they are not here to assimilate. I concede your point that when people fear for their lives they will try to come here despite knowing there is no financial gain to doing so. I think a better solution would be to take a look at countries that treat their citizens so badly that they have to flee. Perhaps we should change our approach to those countries and find a solution to help the citizens fix their own mess and build a future in their own countries. Mexico has vast natural and human resources but corruption and crime is so rampant that people fear for their lives and flee. Perhaps we should stop trade with them until they straighten out their act. Stop trading with countries that commit crime against their own people. Deal appropriately with the war on drugs( but that is another tangent). I know that ultimately my ideas will never come to pass. And i think that we are walking further out onto thinner ice day after day. I hope to someday be able to make an impact but i doubt it... anyway, i think if you and i sat down and had some beers and started writing we could do a better job at finding a sensible solution than the yokels in Washington DC.<NSA_Is_Listening>: Maybe I'm an optimist or idealist. I don't think that they are here to rape the land. I also don't think they need to assimilate. (Full disclosure: my wife is a foreigner[Asian]) Ultimately, I think it would be better for both the US and the rest of America. They would help us and we would help them. They would find prosperity and we just might find richer culture. They would also bring us their ideas and then there's the tax money. I also think you may be also over generalizing and not giving people enough credit. The problem with Mexico and other countries to our south is their government and drug dependency. I don't think embargoes would help. Though, I have not specifically looked at them but historically I don't think they've done much at all. Further, drugs are the main product we get from Mexico that damage both countries. If we stopped the drug war and decriminalized drugs like [portugal](http://mic.com/articles/110344/14-years-after-portugal-decriminalized-all-drugs-here-s-what-s-happening), it would go a long way. We are already seeing benefits of cannabis being decriminalized in California, Washington, and Colorado. Some of that is there is now fewer drugs coming into the US from Mexico. Gangs in Mexico can't keep selling it because the risk of getting caught now outweighs the profits, which are being cut into by the US market (source is a documentary called Drugs inc.). If we cut out all drugs, it might put a dent in their pocket books. To be clear, I am for decriminalization not legalization. &gt; anyway, i think if you and i sat down and had some beers and started writing we could do a better job at finding a sensible solution than the yokels in Washington DC. It would be harder to find a way to do worse.", "num_messages": 12, "avg_score": 1.0833333333}

Google is an advertising company. <DaHolk>: While true, it is also at the very least partially beside the point. A company is more than where it generates it's revenue. So while it is a tech company that generates it's income mostly via advertisement, it's purpose or main function is something entirely different. Whether you want to reduce it to data broker or data hog, either way, advertisment only enters into it in so far as that this is the easiest and by far most lucrative way to make money of that. It's a bit like saying the NSA is in the business of self advertisement, because that's where its operation budget springs from. I would argue that the \"nature\" of a company is more reliant on what it SPENDS money on, not specifically what it makes money off of. True, in many cases that is somewhat the same, in that the money that is made is spend to make more money the same way, but better, but in terms of information and intelligence that can be quite separate.<FountainsOfFluids>: I think these are very valid points. But for the consumer's self-interests, we should be aware of *both* aspects and the long term ramifications.<DaHolk>: The problem is that I just don't think reducing data aggregation to \"sells advertisement\" is in the interest of the customer. It's nice that it points out that the service they provide gets paid for with it, and that people understand that connection, it is also critical to make them understand that this is an issue way bigger than assuming that google's money is spend to bolster merely relegating information to advertisers. The way more interesting question is what they use their money for that is neither spend on bettering their advertisement revenue, nor a service to ensure that.<FountainsOfFluids>: While you may be interested in other things, many people are becoming quite concerned about the apparent loss of privacy over the past 10 years. People with these concerns have very valid points when discussing how Google and Facebook use the information we share online in order to make money. The most clear way of stating what that means to the common consumer is that they sell advertising. That's only reductionist if you ignore the value they bring with their user-facing services. If we're talking about what is in the interest of the the customer, it's the complete knowledge of the ramifications of the transactions they engage in.<DaHolk>: &gt; While you may be interested in other things, many people are becoming quite concerned about the apparent loss of privacy over the past 10 years. There is no contradiction between the two. Just being \"not advertisement\" doesn't make it \"pro privacy\". It actually is the other way round, if you reduce the issue to advertisement, you downplay the privacy issue. Which was the point of my post. Google is way more than an ad seller. That's \"merely\" the revenue source. That doesn't mean that this \"more\" is in our interest. I REALLY don't understand that jump?<FountainsOfFluids>: &gt;It actually is the other way round, if you reduce the issue to advertisement, you downplay the privacy issue. You seem to be missing the fact that targeted advertising is an invasion of privacy. They use your personal information to single you out as somebody who might be the target audience of a client company, and deliver the advertisement to you. Thus the advertising is the cause of the privacy concerns. Yes, there are concerns about the NSA sweeping up your information as well, but the information is only present online because those tech companies are selling access to it for a profit.<DaHolk>: And you that \"bigger issue\" does not mean \"the other isn't one\". Yes, targeted advertisement is ONE way of privacy erosion. But limiting google to that issue is downplaying the overall problem by limiting the problem to the revenue stream and defining the company that way. Which was what I took issue with. &gt;but the information is only present online because those tech companies are selling access to it for a profit. Which has nothing to do with advertisement, and is part of my point! <FountainsOfFluids>: Nothing to do with advertisement? I don't think we're speaking the same language here. Do you not understand how targeted advertisement works?<DaHolk>: Selling data to the NSA is not advertisement, and once aggregated, which way the NSA gets practical access to it is also not at the core an advertisement issue. Not to mention the fact that I initially only used the NSA as an example to visualise how \"method of revenue\" is not at the core a good measure to define an entity or the issues with it. Which was exactly my point. The privacy concerns with data hogs/aggregators goes so far beyond advertisement, that focusing the issue on that is problematic at best. Even if google didn't finance itself via advertisment, but had other ways to capitalise on user data, the issue wouldn't be smaller. This was the initial argument. Reducing google to it's revenue stream is negligent towards the bigger issue. It doesn't mean that advertisement is not an issue. Things can be bigger, and include smaller parts.<FountainsOfFluids>: Ok, I see where you are coming from. But the point of the discussion is to wake people up to how free web service companies actually function. You can't just say that their revenue source is \"besides the point\". It's very much the point of this discussion, and even if you want to broaden the discussion to include the ramifications of data aggregation, the fact that the data is being gathered to be sold is at least a key element. 1. A service is offered that requires personal data. 2. Personal data is stored in order to make a profit. 3. Personal data is now at risk of being used for unintended purposes. Part of the process of waking people up to the issue is to lead them down this chain of events, and if they don't \"get\" that Google and Facebook are storing all their data for profit through advertising, then they'll likely never reach point 3. The idea of \"they sell you to advertisers\" is simply more immediate and visceral to some people, especially if they had never thought of it before. <DaHolk>: The thing is that in my mind, what you discribe as the downside of giving the information is actually also very much the downside of buying it. Google has made a great \"get\" here. On the one hand it has created a way to syphon of data of users that hand it over voluntarily. On the other hand it has created a system that convinces people to hand over huge chunks of their money to buy that data, while it actually retains the data and gets data back! The REALLY interesting stuff happens if you HAVE all the data and the money to do whatever with it. So phrasing the issue as \"the users being sold out to companies who profit\" is really in my opinion downplaying \"what is going to happen next\", and (more importantly considering how this thread started) what google \"IS!\". To reduce google to being a conduit that profits of information being sold to companies is really problematic in that sense. Google in the end has \"all the money\" and all the information. So the actual problem is what is going to happen depends way more on what google has in mind, rather than that your information resulted in other companies trying to sell you something better. And in this, it is important to understand that at the core google is not just a company selling chances to advertise. They aren't in it to sell the data to advertisers. They are in it to raise the money to do with the data as they please. &gt;The idea of \"they sell you to advertisers\" is simply more immediate and visceral to some people, especially if they had never thought of it before. Well, true, but again, the way this thread grew, and how it started is important. Saying they ARE that, just because that is how they raise funds, is problematic. Yes, that part is obiously part of the problem, but there is a difference about what google does (amongst other things) and defining the company that way without regards to the potential.", "num_messages": 15, "avg_score": 536.1333333333}

Not the entire site's membership. <SerouisMe>: Ok dude that is how surveys are done so it also works in this case as there is enough points of data to conclude that it is true if the information was taken randomly and not selected.<Kaeoz>: But it isn't randomly taken. It's selected based on the users location. <Equistremo>: You can still argue that there is no reason for the ratio to be very different in other parte of the world. Especially places like western Europe and north America that share other traits with the UK. <Kaeoz>: Why would there be no difference. The culture in the US is significantly different from the UK. it'd be similar to arguing that there should be no difference in level of smoking or obesity between the two countries. <Equistremo>: I would ask the opposite question: Why would there be a difference at all? It is already known from other sources that men outnumber women on dating sites, and the incentives to join the site are the same throughout. In fact, while I don't expect the numbers in the U.S. To be exactly the same, it wouldn't be surprising if they were in the same ballpark. Even if this data were wrong about the US by a factor of two and the ratio were 8 to 1, the results would be just as meaningful because they still tell you the same thing (broadly speaking).<Kaeoz>: &gt; Why would there be a difference at all?

Even if this data were wrong about the US by a factor of two and the ratio were 8 to 1, the results would be just as meaningful because they still tell you the same thing (broadly speaking). Using these assumptions the data was meaningless to begin with because you already had sufficient data to conclude that it was likely that there were more men than women on the site so arguing that the data is meaningful is moot because it doesn't tell you anything. That the results are not exactly the same is the point. How close they are is very relevant to how accurate the sampling is. <Equistremo>: Again, you can gather that there's a disproportionate amount of men relative to women in US online dating sites from multiple sources. If anything I would argue that this data set suggests that the variables you mention do not change the ratio that much. Also, the data is not meaningless just because there's previous data that proves the same thing. This thread could very well be the first indicator to anyone who is not yet aware of the situation. Finally, I think it' unfair to expect to different data sets to be exactly the same because there's no such thing as perfect sampling. I only expect them to be in the same ballpark. And with ratios so screwy relatively small changes can make the ratio swing wildly.<Kaeoz>: &gt; If anything I would argue that this data set suggests that the variables you mention do not change the ratio that much.

Huzzah! &gt; Finally, I think it' unfair to expect to different data sets to be exactly the same because there's no such thing as perfect sampling. I only expect them to be in the same ballpark. And with ratios so screwy relatively small changes can make the ratio swing wildly. And there is no evidence to suggest that this would be the case. <Equistremo>: I'll try to make shorter replies going forward. * I don't see what two groups of data you are referring too. *Everyone starts somewhere. Even if I had multiple data sets this could be the first of the bunch. * I don't see a reason where this data would be incredibly wrong either.<Kaeoz>: &gt;* I don't see what two groups of data you are referring too. That UK and US are similar because of said reasons. In fact there is nothing to suggest this causal relation. &gt; *Everyone starts somewhere.

And it would still be a shitty dataset to display first. &gt; * I don't see a reason where this data would be incredibly wrong either. See above for all the various reasons that you continually choose to ignore. Like I said the degree of inaccuracy is very pertinent when discussing suitability of a sampling technique. Saying that you cannot think of a reason that two groups may not be significantly different does not demonstrate suitability. <Equistremo>: I'm not saying \"UK's numbers are this, therefore, US numbers are this\". My argument is more like \"UK's numbers are this and it is known that a) large disparity exist in the US and that it is skewed in the same direction and b) it's easier for women to get laid, the US data could look similar to this\". Basically, I'm adding the data set to my previous experience to draw a conslusion, which is very different than what you claimed. Also, if you are referring to this: &gt;Because the dating habits, online culture, and social culture of the UK and US are not the same What I just wrote about women having an easier time getting laid could have much more weight in their decision to join Adultfriendfinder than any of the ones you mention. Therefore, since it's not as valuable for women to join a dating site they should be rarer than men and their rarity should also reflect the disparity in difficulty. In that sense, I would say that this specific data set resembles the results of a game theory problem more than a more typical probability problem. <Kaeoz>: &gt; Basically, I'm adding the data set to my previous experience to draw a conslusion, which is very different than what you claimed. And once again, that doesn't make the conclusion that the US data is similar logical. **Degree is similarity is pertinent when discussing sampling suitability.** You always conveniently seem to ignore this. But then again, it's probably easier for you to bullshit and say \"it's close enough!\" than to actually come up with real data. &gt; What I just wrote about women having an easier time getting laid could have much more weight in their decision to join Adultfriendfinder than any of the ones you mention. Is there any *hard* evidence of this? Because you're comparing a dating myth to basically an inherent fact. &gt; In that sense, I would say that this specific data set resembles the results of a game theory problem more than a more typical probability problem.

However: * If you live in the United States and own any real estate, that information is public record and probably will be for the foreseeable future since the government does not have any specific scheme of what to keep private and what to make public. They are utterly unconcerned with privacy, except in some cases. The biggest things you can do: * If you have a landline, you should be both unlisted and unpublished (these are different things.) * You should freeze your credit. You can unfreeze your credit when you need to have someone do a check (car loan) for a small fee. You can find out how to do this by going to the credit bureaus (all assuming you're in the US; don't know how this works elsewhere) and finding the credit freeze option. * Most importantly -- you should delete (not disable, delete) any and all social networking profiles under your real name. This is a huge source of information leakage. The number one thing you can do is stop using social networking. I am unsympathetic to people who whine about doing so. I did years ago and I miss nothing. There are social networks which allow pseudonyms. This is a better bet if you absolutely have to know what your friends are eating for lunch. * As for Intellius, etc. -- you have to dig, but most have options to blank out your listing, at least from search. You may have to periodically refresh this. They may make you jump through hoops -- fax things in, and so on. In my experience, if you jump through their hoops, they *will* unlist you. The only information available on my real name via Google or Bing is at least ten years old (references to old phone numbers and addresses.) And if you request to have your profile removed/hidden/whatever, my advice is to use honey rather than vinegar. Be nice. Most of these companies know people are hostile to what they do and do not want to make waves by being dicks about removing/hiding information and causing some sort of public campaign against them. There is an exception: Accurint, by Lexis-Nexis. Accurint will only remove data with a court order. However, Accurint requires you to pay to do a search. Accurint are complete and utter dicks. I don't know how else to put it. However, they offer a free (or low-cost, forget) profile (sent on paper by mail) search on your own name to see what they have on you. I recommend you do this. People doing serious background checks on you (vs. idiots just trying to dox you, for example) are likely going to use Accurint. That will let you know what people see when they pay for background info on you. Nevertheless -- all of the ones which offer free searches that I petitioned did remove (or hide) the data from searches. It takes a lot of time, but it was worth it for me. I really need to write up a guide on how to do this one of these days. Suffice to say, for me, it took probably 40 or 50 hours of work total (including research), spread out over perhaps 4 months. Then as I say, about 18 months for the changes to trickle downstream and out of search results. Good luck.<siamesekitten>: Wow, thank you so much! This is incredibly helpful. I am in the U.S. I had no idea about some of the things you mentioned (e.g., freezing credit, landline unlisted and unpublished). Social network sites are something I have figured is contributing to the problem. I stopped using almost everything I was signed up for (e.g., Twitter) years ago and most other ones I never even bothered to sign up for (e.g., Instagram or whatever other stupid crap is out there). Except I still have FB. I have been contemplating getting rid of it because 1) it's stupid and 2) I've wondered how much of my personal info is leaking because of it. So yeah, what you said totally made up my mind to just get rid of it. You mentioned delete, not disabling. I feel like FB only gives you the option to deactivate your account and not delete it? I will have to look into that again. Stupid Facebook. I have never even heard of Accurint. Again, thank you so much, this is really helpful, and while it might take me some time, I think it's worth it. <GarrottedClown>: Alright, the bot wiped out my link to how to permanently delete a Facebook account, but it can be done -- a Facebook account could, last I checked, be either disabled or permanently deleted. Most people would disable the account, but FYI it can also be deleted. Google it.", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 1.5}

However there are already products in use since the 90's that give concrete self healing properties. The most widely used is called Xypex. It's a hydrophilic crystalline admixture added the the plastic concrete (plastic meaning wet). There are really to versions of this powder, which is just about 97% Portland cement. One is added to the wet concrete and mixed at batching. The second is offered as a wipe on. I have used both versions and can attest to the wipe on actually working. I have doubts about the product mixed with the wet concrete as it makes really awful concrete which hydrates too quickly, causes excessive bleeding, and rapid shrinkage. The thing is that concrete does an awful job of not cracking from expansion and contraction, that's why the reinforcement with steel or fibers is necessary. They are there to absorb the tensile loading caused by the expansion/contraction cycles. The concrete really is only good at compressive forces. Just for some added info. <otbflo>: I don't think that is the main reason for rebar.<C0matoes>: Then I suggest you not go into the concrete business. I've owned and operated one for 20 years. ACI certified and extensively trained in this field.<otbflo>: Perfect than you know that it MIGHT be for that reason, and specifically for the contraction part of that reason. There are a lot of reasons for rebar, since your the expert I wont bore you with all of them.<C0matoes>: Might? No, I'm certain. I design and build large concrete structures for utilities and military bases. I was being modest about my qualifications but I'm also self taught engineer. So I implore you to bore me with your facts...<Edit>: by the way rebar has tensile strength bu little compressive so it's function is more for expansion not contraction. <bwate>: Hopefully you aren't the one stamping the structures you design, as shrinkage and temperature steel (ACI 318-11 7.12) is usually not the main controlling factor for concrete design, except with slabs on grade. Most elevated slabs and any walls require tension reinforcement due to the moment imparted by load on the slab (ACI 318-11 ch 10). For a standard elevated slab, that moment occurs at the bottom the slab, which is why more rebar will be need there than in the top of the slab (where S+T controls). There is all shear reinforcement (ACI 318 ch 11) that uses shear ties or similar, but that isn't really the kind of rebar we are discussing. Another note, I agree 100% with your info about Xypex. We had some major issues with pours where our concrete ended up looking like crap when the forms came off. However, it is very necessary in some areas when you are working underground/close to the water table. Also with your edit, it is more the fact that concrete's compressive strength is much greater than steel's. See Whitney's stress block if you want more info on that sort of topic<C0matoes>: First thanks for making the same point I just made. Yes I do stamp the structures I design. Yes you are correct but I don't recall shear coming into this conversation. The point is that rebar is placed into concrete for reinforcement or loading, be it shear loading, impact loading, or tensile loading. It's only purpose is to team up with concrete to make it better. I can get out the ACI books as well but not while driving. Typically concrete tensile is about %10 of compressive. So 4000psi compressive concrete has roughly 400 psi tensile. The steel is there primarily if not solely to transfer the tensile load. <bwate>: &gt; The thing is that concrete does an awful job of not cracking from expansion and contraction, that's why the reinforcement with steel or fibers is necessary. They are there to absorb the tensile loading caused by the expansion/contraction cycles. This is the statement I had issues with. The load definitely comes from other places than this, and I just wanted to make sure that was clarified. You also said that was the only thing rebar was used for, when it is used in many other cases. That was why I brought up shear. <C0matoes>: Yeah maybe I should have worded that a little better. <bwate>: I guess I went a bit over the top with my ACI citing. I figured you probably knew the info, but maybe someone else that wanted some more structural engineering info might look into it. Thanks for putting out the info on the fact that this stuff has been around for a while. People on here tend to get a bit over excited for these sorts of things.<C0matoes>: It's cool. It should be noted that the admixture style really sucks. The wipe on like I said does work pretty good for stopping water infiltration/exfiltration. That being said. Good water tight concrete with low absorption does pretty much the same thing. There is alot of good salesmanship in that product but I don't stand behind it. In the underground utility industry it's not cracks that are the major problem it's microorganisms living off the gases secreting something similar to hydrochloric acid. To fight those we put in antimicrobial products which would essentially render this new stuff dead.<bwate>: Yeah, we almost had to rip down some walls from using the admixture*. It seems like the workability goes down a lot. I don't do much with undergrounds, other than some duct bank so I had not heard of that problem. I think the big issue on here is that people here get so nervous about concrete cracking. No matter what you do, there is going to be some cracks, and most of the time, that isn't a big deal. *Edit: This may have been caused by the crew doing the pour and not the admixture itself. They were known for doing some shoddy work.<C0matoes>: Question. Was the concrete you speak of pink or non colored version? <bwate>: It was non colored. Thinking back on it, the contractor may have used an \"approved equal\" that they found that was a little cheaper. Also, it was the contractor that blamed the admixture for lack of workability. It may have just been shoddy work.<C0matoes>: I doubt it was a workmanship thing. The rapid hydration drives out valuable water needed and when it gets done bleeding off the concrete shrinks a whole lot, typically 1/2\" or more. We've actually been trying to get the stuff removed from projects because of this issue. Louisiana and some places in Florida use it on everything. Sherman Dixie concrete is likely to blame for its extensive use because it's an easy way to get more money from the same product and literally do nothing to improve it.", "num_messages": 16, "avg_score": 312.0625}

Sincerely, ...apparently nobody because everybody believes he was just a good guy all along<spacedawg_ie>: Yep, it's good that the man decided to play clean when he knew he was under the microscope of public scrutiny, but I judge people by what they do when they think they aren't being watched. There's a fable about an old store owner who would hire kids to stock the shelves in the summer. On the first day, each new kid would be asked to dust a shelf where the old-timer had left a $20 note in plain view. If the kid returned with the note, he was known to be trustworthy and earned the job, if he pocketed the 20, he was sent home, a small price to pay for not having untrustworthy, selfish employees. Wheeler was caught red handed and strong armed to do his job as he was supposed to. I'm not going to congratulate him for doing the job or for doing the right thing. It's what he's was supposed to have done from the beginning.<Lvl9LightSpell>: &gt;It's what he's was supposed to have done from the beginning. ... well, no. His job is to be the public's advocate for things like this. He proposed legislation that he believed was in the public's interest. The public came together and said, \"No, this fucking sucks,\" and he listened to them. He wasn't \"caught red-handed,\" he *did his job by listening to public opinion*. If the public ignored him, then of course he would have kept going with it - because he believed his original plan was good enough. The mass commentary from the internet and tech sector (and a push from Obama) changed his mind. If nothing else, he deserves plaudits for being willing to listen to public opinion, change his viewpoint based on feedback, and be an actual advocate for the people, instead of just railroading through his beliefs.<spacedawg_ie>: I see what you're saying but I disagree that it's necessary for a critical mass of people to submit over 5 million explanations of the same common sense point before their opinion can be accurately transposed into action by their elected representative. This is a terrible inefficient method that can be simplified by not being so far out of touch/corrupt (or anything in between, take your pick) in the first place.<Lvl9LightSpell>: That's very easy to say, but the truth of the matter is that legislation is difficult, especially on things you don't understand. That's why lobbyists exist. And if you (as an elected representative) don't understand something, and a lobbyist sure seems to, then you're going to defer to them, because they clearly know more than you. Often, the problem with the system as it stands isn't that the elected representatives aren't willing to listen to the people per se, it's that the public is the one interest group that doesn't have lobbyists.<spacedawg_ie>: If people are not qualified to perform a task, than running for that position is a sign of dangerous arrogance. You are right, career position taking the seats of qualified experts are the problem. I however am less apologetic for this sorry state of affairs. I'm sorry if I hold public representatives and industry regulators to a higher standard than a dithering granddad.<deadlast>: In other words, legislators should be experts on all industries and all policy issues.

It depends maybe you could do a free tier (with a few ads) and a paid tier or multiple tiers. <Indekkusu>: &gt;it would be like spotify/pandora So shit pay rates for the producers of content and you can't have live performances of TV shows or movies to cover the loss in income for the producer.<torymcclory>: Why you hating on an idea.

On their website they state \"The important fact to note is that for every new Spotify user, we increase the amount of revenue we receive and, in turn, the amount of royalties we pay out to the industry\" so actually its better if more people sign up because then they can give out bigger payouts to artists. I never said anything about bundles, I just want a fair pricing system that's not fragmented with every company owning a different TV show. <Indekkusu>: &gt; I never said anything about bundles You said \"[without] having to sign up to 20 companies\" which i interpret as all channels in one big bundle. &gt; I just want a fair pricing system that's not fragmented with every company owning a different TV show. 1000s of TV producers with different models and some in markets where internet streaming isn't an viable option yet.<torymcclory>: Just out of curiosity, what are your views regarding the current TV and film industry, do you feel they could be doing more to combat piracy or is all the blame on pirates?<Indekkusu>: It shouldn't be the industry enforcing the laws, the government should do it but currently they are forced to do it due to the absence of law enforcement on the internet.<torymcclory>: Interesting.
