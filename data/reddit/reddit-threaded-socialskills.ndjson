I got it all wrong, Small talk should not be thought of that much, i shouldn't think of what im gonna say(not saying you shouldnt give a fuck at all) but just saying what comes on your mind without caring what the person in front of you would react.

It has happened in every conversation where it then feels liek the conversation is just between me and him rather than a group conversation. However, when I speak in return I look around the group at everyone. Today also they were sat next to me and they leaned really, really close to my face whilst speaking, it wasn't uncomfortable but I did look away after a few seconds as it felt too close for the setting we were in.

If someone is attracted to you they\u2019ll want to make a good impression on you more so than anyone else, so your reactions to what they are saying becomes more important. Their whole talk becomes a sort of performance for you, it\u2019s a kinda cynical perspective because people end up hiding their real thoughts just to present a good image. Again this might not be the case so don\u2019t assume this guy is secretly macking on you.<xomoreconfidence>: They look at me and smile as they speak, which makes me involuntarily smile back and then I catch myself because what is a group conversation with 4 other individuals listening and watching ends up feeling too intimate and one-on-one, however they just carry on looking at me.

This really hurt, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m on the spectrum at all, I can just be really awkward at times. I don\u2019t really talk much, because when I do I end up making a fool out of myself (i.e. I tried asking one of the guys to use their bathroom, but I accidentally blurted out \u201cCan I borrow your bathroom?\u201d and everyone started laughing). I\u2019m self-aware of how my mannerisms and actions can seem a little off to some, but after 3 years of trying to fix it I\u2019ve realized that there\u2019s really nothing I can do to help it. This situation really hit me hard and I feel like never talking to anyone again after what happened. <JayKayVay>: Firstly, there's nothing wrong with being Autistic - I'd ask you to consider why you'd be hurt by someone thinking you're Autistic, then recognize these guys are ableist jerks so their opinion is worthless. It sounds like you have social anxiety so I understand why you'd be hurt they were joking about you behind your back, when already anxious about how you my be perceived having those fears come to fruition isn't just a hit to your feelings but is going to back-up your anxiety. Have you sought therapy? Your mannerisms and actions may be down to anxiety and that is something that can be treated. <ga1ningconfidence>: I think I should clarify by saying that I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything wrong with being autistic, I was just frustrated that my social skills are so bad that people assume that I have a disorder. <DARKRonnoc>: Fuck em man. What they said doesn't matter unless you give it weight. It doesn't sound like your skills are that awful but rather it sounds like they may be assholes. Criticism can suck, but it can also be your best friend if you use it correctly. So what if some people think you're autistic and made fun of you? What fucknuts. But see, you got the negative judgement and you survived. That is literally the worst thing that could happen and you're still alive and thriving. No big deal. Just get out there and keep trying.

Hey everyone! As a long time introvert and sciences \u201cgeek\u201d I\u2019d like to reach out to those who struggle socially as I use too. Before I begin the most important thing is to squash the idea that you\u2019re hopeless or incapable of impacting, speaking and connecting on an emotional level with others. This is quite false, despite whatever failures you\u2019ve had in the past. Truth is, I don\u2019t really care about meeting and connecting with others when it\u2019s not on a professional basis. I\u2019m someone that\u2019s content having 5-10 close friends. I don\u2019t use social media outside of linked-In. But I have large goals career wise, and anyone who has worked their way up the competitive business latter would tell you that people liking you (especially superiors) is absolutely critical. As a manager you have to be able to communicate, and there is no significant upper level roles in any company that don\u2019t require you to oversee, and communicate with others. \u201cCommunication is an art\u201d These words cannot be taken lightly. Like any competitive atmosphere, you must master it. It takes practice and time. Just like any sport, challenging class, or job, practice is everything. But what I\u2019m looking to do is elaborate on developing an arsenal of questions that will allow you to excel in any atmosphere. Questions are all you need. People love talking about themselves and their accomplishments. They love expressing THEIR viewpoints. You don\u2019t need to elaborate on yourself at all to entice others. Let me provide a few powerful questions as an example for normal life (not job focused): (If it\u2019s your first interaction, ask basic questions first. DO NOT come out of the blue with the following questions) - May I ask you a personal question? (They\u2019ll always say yes, always. If you\u2019re going to ask a power question approval is a must lead with this) - What impact have your parents had on your life? (Connects emotionally despite answer being good or bad) - What was one of the happiest days in your life? (connects in a positive emotional level) - What\u2019s your largest aspiration or goal for your future? (connects in a positive emotional level) - Who has impacted you the most in your life? (Connects positively, if comfortable with you, possibly a negative answer which is a good sign) These are only a few questions that I have in my \u201carsenal\u201d that will help you develop a relationship not just only in a professional level but emotionally. Now here\u2019s a few for the professional atmosphere, these will allow you to dominate interviews and create great conversation with superiors: First off, if someone ever asks you \u201cTell me about yourself?\u201d in an interview, always follow with \u201cwhat specifically would you like to know?\u201d Always make others be specific, this is crucial in conversation control. - What about your organization do you like the most? - What about your job do you like the most? - Who in your company have you learned the most from? - How do you feel about my performance (or interview), and how can I make a better impact on you? - How did you get into the role you currently have? - What would you like to see more of in your company? What would you like to see less of? I\u2019m going to conclude this here, but I want to reiterate the fact that I don\u2019t enjoy communicating all that much. However, with questions like these you can absolutely dominate conversations and interviews in an incredibly positive manner. Most importantly of all, when asking these questions SMILE or look CONCERNED depending on the context. Develop your own arsenal and watch as communication become easy, and fun. Message me your stories of you utilizing these questions, and if you need a specific one for a situation feel free to reach out as well. I\u2019m a nerd and an engineer at heart. I now make large quantities of money in marketing and management. I even believe that being an introvert helps in jobs like these, you stay focused on your plans and questions, cause it\u2019s all you\u2019ve got. Works even better at the bars. I hope this helps some of you out there! Thanks! <FlightOfTheSeraphim>: Thank you so much!

Not every liberal is going to denounce you for being a conservative, just avoid the ones with colored hair.

I\u2019m deeply regretful for how I spent my years growing up. I was very shy since middle school. I had opportunities to grow out of my shyness. I could have tried inviting people over to my house to hang out, trying to talk to girls, trying to make friends and be more outgoing, develop interests, etc. But I never did. I kept telling myself that I would learn how to do it later. Instead I focused on getting good grades and trying to do well in school. I didn\u2019t spend all my time studying or anything, but I always used academics as an excuse for not focusing on developing my social skills or developing passions. So as high school passed, I felt really lonely and it pained me when I realized that I didn\u2019t have a social group to belong to and never had kissed / had a relationship. I left high school realizing I had no passion for one thing. The only thing I could consider a big interest of mine was basketball, but it was more like a hobby than anything. Still, I told myself that college would be a new experience. People told me it would be okay and I felt college would be a new experience. Because I was a good student, I ended up going to a pretty top school. I thought I was going to be happy there, even though it wasn\u2019t my dream school by any means. I was going to party, hook up with girls, make tons of friends, etc. But as college went by, I found that I wasn\u2019t doing any of these things. By my sophomore year, I realized that I didn\u2019t have any solid friend group once again. I went to parties, but felt like an outsider all the time and always left early to go back home. I joined a fraternity, but thought I didn\u2019t mesh well with them initially and didn\u2019t make great relationships with the brothers. By the time I graduated, I once again found myself in that situation I was in after high school. I didn\u2019t accomplish the things I wanted to, and I\u2019m deeply ashamed and frustrated with myself for never stepping up to become better. The opportunities were definitely there, I just didn\u2019t take action. I\u2019m telling you this because I think your youth is the time when you grow the most, so make the most of it now and don\u2019t put off your social growth for later, because I assure you it will get exponentially harder. I fucked up my high school and college years and I find myself in a position where I\u2019m so ashamed by my lack of a social life and experiences that I can\u2019t seem to reach out to anyone and socialize with them. I can\u2019t even call my closest friends from back home or my family to tell them what I\u2019m going through because I\u2019m so embarrassed of the person that I am. I think I may be depressed, but more than anything I just feel so lost and hopeless and I tell you this has to be the worst feeling I\u2019ve ever experienced. To know that you have gotten to this point without any traumatic experiences or other major hardships in your life really damages your psyche. I\u2019m so convinced that I\u2019m just a weak person, and I constantly try to find something or someone to blame, but it was always just me. I honestly don\u2019t know what to do with myself anymore. I don\u2019t think any advice could help me. It feels like I would literally need someone else to possess my mind and take over my body to get me out of this situation. I\u2019m so stuck. Sorry that was a lot of rambling. Don\u2019t feel bad for me. It\u2019s hard to put into words what\u2019s going on in my head, but I just want to warn you younger people what life could end up like if you put shit off for later. If you have the ability to build your social skills, I implore you to do it now. <SrWoperPants>: It might be to late for me too.

I have very little that is noteworthy about me. This is a question that I seem to encounter but always struggle with answering. I am afraid of boring the other person and making them leave a conversation. I try to be curious about the other person but that only lasts for so long until they start asking me questions. Can anyone offer advice for this situation? <Edit>: I've got to go to class so I won't be able to respond until late tonight. It's been great talking with all of you. I would have never guessed I would get this much support and this many answers. It put things into perspective for me and shows me I need to worry less when talking. Thank you all for taking the time to respond to my post. You guys are awesome.<thetebe>: First off: You see yourself as a boring person. So that is what you are. Change your self narrative. In my experience most people don't have all that much noteworthy about themselves, it is more about the way we talk and less about what we say. That time you took out the trash and it was winter and you slipped, that could be a good story if presented in a fun way. You are doing great with being curious about them, but you are stealing their thunder a bit when you don't let them be curious too. You are not being curious because you seem to use it as a shield. If you are curious you should be curious about what they ask and how that leads you into new conversations. What is really the problem with them asking you questions? It sounds like you get practice with being on the asking end, perhaps you should start practising being the one asked too. What is the worst that can happen? <Hospice_Cookies>: I guess I'm just afraid of people leaving me. It's only in the past year I've tried to hold conversations with others and it makes me feel like I'm a failure if someone leaves because of me. I have never heard of using curiosity as a shield before. I guess it would make sense though. I do try to take the conversations in new ways with the answers I've been given and have had success in this. When you put it this way, I can definitely see how my curiosity can deflect the conversation. <Cyborg_Commando>: So what do you do? Like for fun. You just talk about that. See if that person is entertaining to you. Or if you like to please people see if they make you feel good about yourself while doing it. You have to value your time. You're also trying to see if they're worth your while. You have to find your own thing. That's going to make it easier to drop people. Which, unfortunately is something we have to do sometimes.<Hospice_Cookies>: I really just lurk reddit and watch youtube, I play video games here and there but I sometimes find it exhausing these days. My time really isn't worth valuing. It seems like I have too much of it and I can't get out of the house to do much. If it's not one problem, it's another. Dropping people has never been an issue for me, after all, there's usually someone else people would rather be with. I don't blame them.<Cyborg_Commando>: What is your home life like? Do you have your own space?<Hospice_Cookies>: There isn't a whole lot for me to say. As for recently, my family and I moved up to New Hampshire about a year and a half ago. Since then I've going to a community college and taking college courses in accounting. Tomorrow is going to be the end of my third semester. I do not have a job, my parents prefer me to be at home to watch after the dogs and my mother should my father need to go somewhere. I just do homework take do what's expected of me. If by own space you mean house/apartment, no. I am a dependent continuing to live with my parents. I'm looking to move out in a few years after things get sorted and I get a college education, a job, and a place to live.<Cyborg_Commando>: I mean like, do you have your own room/private space?<Hospice_Cookies>: I do, a couple actually. I have my own room and the basement. I tend to just go in the basement whenever I want to get away from others. It can be a bit noisy at times, but for the most part it's quiet and peaceful.<Cyborg_Commando>: Those spaces are full of only your things?<Hospice_Cookies>: Nope, just my room. The basement is filled with things that couldn't find a place anywhere in the house. We have a little area down there that has a TV and a futon. The rest is mostly clutter and things we don't want to throw away.<Cyborg_Commando>: Is there clutter in any other rooms of the house?<Hospice_Cookies>: Not really, the dining room is a bit of a mess but that is only because of me having a bunch of papers lying around for finals. The rest of the house is clean.<Cyborg_Commando>: Would you feel comfortable inviting a friend into your house?<Hospice_Cookies>: Yes, it would only take minutes to clean up. Maybe about an hour depending on how short notice it is. I mentioned that the basement is kinda cluttered but that's mostly furniture that never found a home when we moved. Everything else in the house is orderly.<Cyborg_Commando>: That's great! It's important that your spaces make you happy. If they aren't you should decorate them somehow. That will help keep your energy up. You say you watch a lot of YouTube? What do you watch usually? <Hospice_Cookies>: I usually watch gaming related channels. Hearthstone videos are nice to relax to here and there. Some of my favorites channels include BedBananas, Summoning Salt, and Mr. Sark (whenever they upload, they don't have regular uploading schedules). My favorite hearthstone players are Brain Kibler and Thijs.<Cyborg_Commando>: I remember kibler from magic the gathering. I don't know anything about hearthstone or who those other guys are.<Hospice_Cookies>: Brief summary of them all: Mr. Sark and Bedbanans are content creators which usually feature funny/amusing moments in some of the games they play. They usually play a variety of different games and don't really stick with the same ones. Summoning Salt is a youtuber who showcases speedrun progressions. Only uploads a couple months but I always enjoy watching anything he uploads. Definitely worth a watch if you are interested in speedrun history for a few games. Thijs is a European hearthstone player and he play competitively. Definitely not for everyone but I enjoy watching him play. He's a bit eccentric but enjoys playing hearthstone.<Cyborg_Commando>: I'm sorry I don't know what most of that stuff means. Myself, I like fountain pens, bullet journaling, and children's literature. Have you ever read \"the day the crayons quit\"? It is hilarious. Basically this kid goes to open is crayon box but instead of finding his crayons he finds that each one has written him a letter. The letters are basically a list of grievances. The beige crayon goes \"I am not light brown. I am beige and I am proud.\" Lol<Hospice_Cookies>: I've never read that book, the small description you give is hilarious. I've never done anything with fountain pens. I've looked in the past to see what they were/see how much they cost. Do you know of any budget pens that would be fun to start with? I'm entirely unaware of what bullet journaling is. What is that?<Cyborg_Commando>: Lamy safari is my favorite one right now. It's made out of the same kind of plastic as Legos. I think I paid$15 for it. Bullet journaling is a system of journaling very complicated if you don't know what you're looking at but there's short YouTube videos which explain the system. I use it because it mostly gives me a reason to buy nice fountain pens. Lol <Hospice_Cookies>: The pen's on sale right now for $22, I might pick that up later. Fountain pens have interested me for a bit, just never really had a reason to pick one up. I'll look up bullet journaling later. Looks kinda complex.<Cyborg_Commando>: Yeah! A new convert. But remember, you gotta do you! It's just that some interests are a lot more simple than others to talk about. I also like board games but just explaining that they didn't stop making new ones after they invented Trouble takes too long. So not worth it right away and new friends might get bored. Important thing is to just find things that you like. If you had told me that my hobbies were boring after I told you what they were then I would just think that you weren't somebody that I wanted to talk to anyway bc no shared interests. You just want to be your own fulfilled person, first.<Hospice_Cookies>: &gt; You just want to be your own fulfilled person, first I'm still working on this. Some days I think I want one thing and the next I want another. Kinda makes it hard to focus on one thing when it's not clear what I actually want to do. Some interests are definitely easier to explain than others. I may not understand all interests but I do try to make an effort to understand and talk about them. It seems like when I'm on the explaining end I don't really know what to say. I've gotta go to class, so I can't respond until late tonight. It's been great talking with you, thank you for the advice and the conversation! I'll look into the fountain pen and remember you. :P<Cyborg_Commando>: I've got to go too. My last exam.

Many Autistic people benefit off of improv or acting classes. Good you're moving way from that kind of comedy, maybe try to replace it with a better quality of humor - go watch comedians and see how they do it, also notice their timing...often they use a pause for effect, you can use that to cover-up your inertia. On the inertia also work with it rather than against it, be someone who's cool and takes their time to speak - rather than someone who panics when they can't think of what to say. Try self-help books too, a lot of them are useless to be honest, but one I found useful was [How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks For Big Success In Relationships](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0722538073/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) There's no such thing as a \"very minor case of autism\" - a person is either Autistic or they're not, same way a person is either pregnant or they're not - you're Autistic, there's nothing wrong with that. &amp;#x200B;<disturbedjuice>: Thanks!

After a month of blowing any chance I had with her, I gave up and decided it was time to get my life back together. So I did, and today I figured I'd give it another shot... but as soon as I went up to her she just asked me to leave her alone.

Please don't go to tell the guy that he's cute. While you may see it that way, but it can backfire for some guys. Instead, try ice breaker by asking about the body part that he works on, e.g. bicep, tricep, abs, thigh. Ask how often he works out and such. Gauge his interest. If the guy seems cool and open, you can talk to him more and find out if he's seeing anyone. If not, then you can move forward by asking for a number for meeting up some other time. If he seems grouchy, you can just say keep up good work and move on. Alternatively, shoes, arm band, head band, fit bit stuff could be used for engaging the conversation instead of body parts if you don't feel comfortable mention those.<neatoburrit0h>: while an ice breaker is a great way to start a conversation to get to know the guy further, i don't. I'm not interested in getting his number or going out with him, I only want to shower him in the compliment. I appreciate you sticking to your guns though. Power to ya! <siammang>: In that case, please just say \"hey man.. I like your guns/abs/legs.\" and just carry on with your routine. Save the, \"aww. You're cute\" for when he plays with puppies, kitties, and or kids or when he does something nice to you or someone. Not he's cute because he's pumping his gains at the gym. Telling someone being cute is complimenting the sensitive side. Probably not the goal of those who's hitting up with the gym. I understand that you see the person looking cute, but hope you the gist here.<neatoburrit0h>: i read your downvoted comment, and while I don't agree with \"cute\" being perceived as \"weak\" or on the \"sensitive side\" in that matter, i can definitely agree with that there's a time and place for the appropriate compliment and cute may be the wrong word choice at a gym. i'll keep away from that and stick with \"your muscles look cut af\" <siammang>: It has more to do with social norms as well. Men tend to not like being perceived as being weak. It's in parallel to how women don't like being objectified. If men find you attractive, would you prefer they tell you, \"you looks great!\" Or maybe complimenting your choice of clothing rather than someone come to your face and say, \" yo girl I really like your bosom. Very sexy!!\"? How well you know the person could matter as well. It's probably fine if you are close with the person, but it certainly sends a weird signal for first time encounter for two strangers.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 2.5}

Lol. <JoinedRedditForEsper>: I never said tell her you love her. I said dont intentionally not \"get too attached\"<Zerqzee>: Read his post. He just said he loved her, don't get too attached the minute a connection is made. It scares people. <JoinedRedditForEsper>: Still disagree. Refer back to my first comment.<Zerqzee>: I disagree that you don't have social issues then lol. Ask any girl youve known for a few years out, cuddle and flirt then tell her how much you care and that you're so happy and all this shit and you're on your way back to being \"that one guy she almost dated\" . Just asked a few female co workers , they said they'd prefer even though if they knew them for a few years they'd still like to take it slow in the romantic area. Either way, if OP feels lik he should tell her how he fully feels and he wants to get attached by all means he can. I just think your encouraging him to take a risk that might hurt his friendship. <JoinedRedditForEsper>: First thing: I AM a girl. I've been in a relationship for 8 years and am engaged. I know my shit. <Second>: I never said tell this chick xyz, theres a difference between telling the girl how you feel and having the feelings to begin with. Constricting the feelings inside you can hurt a relationship, its healthier to have these good feelings and not go screaming them right out the gate. Which is what I encouraged. Third, he already established that the girl took lead and kissed him back too, so as far as hurting the friendship, that's kinda out the window. The crossed the bridge, theres no going back really. I encouraged OP to feel how he feels and not try to repress anything over fear of getting hurt. At the same time, yes, take it slow and dont TELL her you love her for at least a few months.<Zerqzee>: Im literally saying that lol, not getting too attached is having the ability to control your emotions and being able to read the situation correctly. People are bound to get hurt in relationships, it happens. But why would you want to get hurt the minute you step in it? Take a minute to look at the relationship for it's face value then dictate whether or not you feel the way you feel. <JoinedRedditForEsper>: You're either not understanding me, or what \"dont get too attached\" actually means.

The first thing might be to stop giving them shells to drop on you. You act \"gay?\" They call you \"gay.\" Dont feed the flames. In response, you could take it as a chance to show them your wit by verbally swinging back. Jokingly of course. Dont be a bully. Bullies suck eggs. You could ask to be placed in another division. I dunno if it works that way but eh. If you asked them as a group to stop, that might fuel the flames unless they're above the curve. but try to experiment with different responses. Try new things, and it'll sharpen your knife and give you a pocket full of options you can use later in life. 2. Maybe you're the problem. This could be them implicitly telling you that your behavior is no bueno. Not too good at all amigo. When I was in high school I was in almost the same situation and I just changed the problem behavior. At first I thought I was \"selling out\" or some kind of arrogant bullshit but the change was for the best. I dunno.

So recently, I've started trying to branch out more. I started by walking around my college campus between my classes every Tuesday and Thursday, telling myself I had to talk to at least one person that day. But I'm always too afraid to talk to anyone. I just left a heavy metal show, where I'd have more in common with people than anywhere else. I wanted to make friends, but once again, I'm too afraid to talk to anyone.. There was an extremely pretty girl I wanted to talk to, and I'm kicking myself so hard for not trying. I just kept waiting for the perfect opportunity, where she wasn't preoccupied with something, and that opportunity never came. Even if she had just wanted to be friends, I would have been happy with that. I'm at my wits end with myself.. What do I do? How do I approach someone? What do I say? I don't understand. I don't understand any of this.<xdiggertree>: First of all, props to you for wanting to make an effort to keep growing! It\u2019s always much harder to learn something than to keep it going, so, just remember it IS hard. I would not focus on getting girls right now because IMO friends are more fulfilling than fleeting romances. You mention two different topics, making friends and initiating with strangers. These are two very different topics that need different skills, so, I would suggest you approach these two as two different topics - this should actually make it easier for you. Now, if your main goal is to make friends and that is why you are talking to strangers, we would have a different story. Not to scare you off, but it is harder to make friends through meeting only strangers. It is hard enough just to make friends through friends (I know through experience). There are some tricks to making friends through strangers, best thing would be to become a regular at a couple places *you* find comfortable, where you are in your zone. So, if you love metal shows, why not try working at a venue. That would keep you in your zone, provide income, but, most importantly, give you repeated exposure. Sooner or later people will remember you and they can do more of the heavy lifting. A person has to be pretty smooth to make friends with complete strangers.

Other tips, if you are too nervous to make eye contact, go somewhere where there are things to look at and talk about together, a pier, a shitty museum, a mall. If things get stale and you start to get nervous, just change the setting. Surround yourself with a context that has a lot of potential topics, don\u2019t go for coffee for this reason. If you already chose coffee, don\u2019t have any caffeine and just suggest going out for a walk somewhere (places I suggested) after she finishes it.

For instance, people (men) get called creepy for a whole slew of things... If you know you are not being creepy, then you are not being creepy regardless of what that group thinks. Keep doing what you are doing. The real creep knows he/she is a creep and has malicious intent in their mind. To react negatively when someone implies you are creepy, you are broadcasting that you don't know whether you are or are not a creep. You are telling people that their is a possibility you are being malicious and their assumption of you as a creep automatically becomes realer (perception wise). This is not to be taken advantage of. Only you know where your true intentions lie. If you are covering up your malicious intent with excuses then you deserve what you get. <Dagobert_Juke>: There's more to social life than norms, my friend. Also, 'a difference in norms' how you put it sounds like these norms are always preexisting and perhaps even static while they are often created and changed over the course of a social relationship. For example, a single camping trip can become a tradition during the first trip itself. [deleted]: you come into every social situation with a preexisting set of norms. the first trip is only a catalyst for tradition... tradition is passed onto another generation (including older versions of yourself). I would argue that the tradition is not established until you have proven that a group has maintained it. as far as your comment goes on \"more to social life than norms\", you are a set of habits. you appreciate people based on their positive habits (in your eyes). these habits are the norms of your personhood; you have either established proofs as blueprints for how to act in certain situations and settings or have automatic responses... regardless they are normal for you... and play 100% into whether you choose to continue spending time around someone. if you are inconsistent, that is something you will have to work on. as much as your ego may reject it, you have an identity that is evaluated by others based on the identity you are fulfilling relative to your thoughts and aspirations.<Dagobert_Juke>: I would not say habits are norms of your personhood. Norms are socially created rules of behaviour closely linked to expectations and values (both of which also matter yet are not norms as such). For example, consider the camping trip. This can create the expectation of a 'tradition' for one group but not for the other. These expectations are explored and negotiated in further interaction based on values - ie why is the camping trip worth it. Habits are neurological pathways which have been reinforced by acquiring certain rewards from acting on cues in a certain manner. Habits are indeed very important for your sense of self, and also influence how people see you. However, not all habits - especially the ones that matter - are hard to spot for many people who you will engane with (since they are only observable over time). Therefore, in social situations people can present themselves in ways contrary to their true habits. Thus, in additions to norms, expectations, values and habits, manipulation of impressions also matter in social interaction. I feel it is too reductionist thinking to through everything on the 'norms' pile. <Edit>: added one word [deleted]: true, I think it is good that you brought up tradition though because a habit is a sort of tradition of yourself. I guess it can be a slight underestimation of human potential to reduce all interaction down to norms and habits and the case that new traditions and habits are formed on any time basis is evidence that social interaction is more nuanced and people do not always conform to their habits and norms. yet, for the post's argument's sake you make a judgment call of your personal habits to say that you want to break your mold when doing so based on your perception that your life isn't quality enough as it is. at a bare minimum, norms and habits play into every decision that isn't an automated process to sustain our bodies<Dagobert_Juke>: Agreed. I do like the idea that you should not defend attacks that miss their targets (ie being thought a creep)", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 1.5}

When you\u2019re meeting someone new, don\u2019t OVERSHARE. It\u2019s okay to say something like \u201cI was a little nervous to meet you\u201d but try to avoid the details about how you thought about it for hours until you finally fell asleep from exhaustion the night before, and now you\u2019ve only had 1 hour of sleep. This also applies to aspects in your life. If you have a medical diagnosis that is very prevalent, or a story that you feel like has defined you, it hasn\u2019t. You define you. Those things should be kept to yourself until someone has earned the right to know them. 2. If you\u2019re starting to feel anxiety creep up, find something to touch. A couch, your pants, your steering wheel, describe the sensation of touching the item to yourself. (Cool, smooth, leathery, moist, ect.) find 5 or more descriptive terms for your item. This will break your concentration and calm the voice inside your head. 3. If you don\u2019t know what to talk about when first meeting someone, a go to is to get them to talk about themselves. People love to talk about themselves. Don\u2019t pry into their lives, but maybe make a comment or ask a question about something they are wearing (avoid sexual comments, or the comments relating to their body in anyway.) Good luck fellow social skill searchers! <Edit>: This got WAY more attention than I thought it would. I\u2019m so happy many of you can take at least something from my post, but I feel as if I need to add a disclaimer. I\u2019m not a therapist. To get to the point where I am today, it took several times in therapy, I end up in a mental hospital at one point several years ago. I\u2019ve worked HARD to get where I am today mentally. My advice is good but it\u2019s not professional advice. Nothing can replace the advice of a professional. If you find yourself in a place where your social anxiety or depression has made you think about self harm, please seek professional help. <NotTheIRA>: I read once about a trick called the FORD method for initiating conversation F-FAMILY ask about their family, brothers, sisters, what do they do etc O-OCCUPATION what job are they working in, how are they finding it R-RECREATION what do they do in their spare time, sports, TV shows etc D-DREAMS what are they looking forward to in the future, any trips planned, or long term goals Almost always you'll find that one of these will spin on into a real convo without you realising, and it sure beats sitting in an awkward silence. And if it doesn't work, maybe that person just doesn't wanna chat! Anyway it's been super useful to me over time I hope it can help someone else! <Notoast4you>: Also is RAPE for what to not talk about. R-RELIGION just don\u2019t, unless of course you\u2019re aiming to find a metaphorical skeleton in the closet. A-ABORTION extremely hot topic between genders if you are on polar ends of agreement, essentially a how to have a bad time starter pack. P-POLITICS just watch them take it personally when you say one thing out of line. E-EXES an unrelatable beast guaranteed to silence the dinner table! (especially if you throw in the curve ball of a positive comment about an ex). <respectableusername>: Also rape.

Or is it the same team ?<trapped_beneath>: A few different teams across soccer and bball <FlamingLobster>: And the people in the teams are from different social groups? I remember in HS and even in college, we had this friend who would play soccer with us and what not. I dont want to say everyone but majority of the people teased and bothered him because he had this way doing things. He was very meticulous and uptight. He was(is) kind of like Dwight from the office. Anyways, he was okay with that and he understood why we bothered him and we missed him when he wasn't there. What im saying is that what are their intentions? Are they trying to harm you? And which of your qualities are they attacking?<trapped_beneath>: They weren\u2019t my friends. The people making fun of me were from several different social groups. They teased me for a multitude of things, including the way I act, my name (my name is very uncommon and ends in \u201cance\u201d), the way I play (I was a late bloomer and didn\u2019t grow until my senior year after quitting sports, was shorter and chubbier than everyone else up until then). It was a pretty clear cut case of finding a weak member of the group and bullying them<FlamingLobster>: They sound like shitty people", "num_messages": 8, "avg_score": 7.375}

Also, one thing I've learnt the last year is to ask the other person questions. You've heard it before but it really works. People love talking about themselves and if you can't think about what to say - just ask another question. You need to put down those masks man. I lived behind one of mine until I was little over 30 years old - and I wasn't even fully aware. You need to accept yourself as you are. You can't change the past so take advantage of it instead and use it in whatever way you can for the future. <witsend2384>: I've been trying the questions thing lately.

Not everyone will find you attractive, so there's nothing wrong with that either. Try to interact with people with small talks as often as you could.

I've noticed a trend in posts in this sub where posters have problems dealing with a 'difficult' person. This often touches my favourite subject of late: passive aggression and passive aggressive personalities. So I've complied my posts into one long one: (Note, I am no psychologist or expert all, all advice I'm giving comes from my own reading and experiences. I had a falling out earlier this year of a an ex friend of many years who used to drive me absolutely crazy. Since then I've done a fair bit of reading on the topic of What The Hell Is Wrong With Him and in doing so found the information useful for dealing with others too.) <https>://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/communication-success/201508/10-signs-passive-aggressive-relationship &gt;The NYU Medical Center defines a passive-aggressive individual as someone who \"may appear to comply or act appropriately, but actually behaves negatively and passively resists.\u201d The ten common traits of passive aggressive behaviour: &gt; Disguised Verbal Hostility &gt; Disguised Hostile Humor &gt; Disguised Relational Hostility &gt; Disguised Psychological Manipulation &gt; Guilt-Baiting &gt; Stalling &gt; Resistance &gt; Underhanded Sabotage &gt; Self-Punishment (\u201cI\u2019ll show YOU\u201d) &gt; Victimhood **Why are they like this?** The fact is everyone is a bit passive aggressive sometimes, people tend to do it when they feel like they\u2019re unable to voice their hostility openly for whatever reason. Sometimes even for good reason (service workers would go insane if not for passive aggression because of the inherent power balance of their job) Often this is done under the guise of ostensible \u2018niceness\u2019. When you know someone who's *always* a bit like that as an inherent facet of their personality style its very possible that they see themselves as \u2018too nice\u2019 to ever stoop to outright hostility, which makes getting them to admit to their disguised hostility incredibly frustrating. The most compelling theory around passive aggressive personalities is that it comes from having overbearing and critical helicopter parents, who enforce \u2018niceness\u2019 on the child. The resulting adult wants the things all adults want (recognition, love, attention) but never learned the proactive, positive, assertive ways to get them. So they fall back on the default one that worked as a child - sulking. I don\u2019t want to get too deep into psychoanalysis and nature vs nurture but I like this theory because it gives the best roadmap of how to deal with a passive aggressive personality - don\u2019t allow yourself to become their parents. Their sulky behaviour tends to push people around them into the roles of either marshmallow parent (The one who goes 'fine...I'll do it' who meets their needs without them having to ask) or critical parent (who is an unfair tyrant to be rebelled against). They resent their dependance on marshmallow parent almost as much as they do critical parent though, their stalling roundabout bullshit is how they deal with this conflict, a way of saying \u201cno\u201d without actually saying no. Passive aggressives tend to see themselves as fundamentally nice but frustrated and chronically unappreciated, making everyone else feel as frustrated and unappreciated as they do is their passive revenge against the world. **Never get angry at a passive aggressive** They crave it. They unconsciously enjoy soliciting extreme reactions in others while they sit back and go 'I don't know what *you're* so upset about I'm just being reasonable/logical/joking\". Whenever you blow up at their provocations its a relief for them since it shifts responsibility for their emotions from them to you. You've just validated their 'everyone is against me' worldview. They want a villain for their lives, if you're not careful it will be you. **Passive aggressives and complaining** Common sense would dictate that when people complain about their problems, they want help. Don't assume this. Understand that with his constant complaining and sulking PA is (unconsciously) playing a kind of game, the game is called \u201cbet you can\u2019t make me happy\u201d. It suckers in well meaning people and leaves them drained. He \u201cwins\u201d the game every time he frustrates efforts to help him because it means he\u2019s successfully demonstrated that his problems are uniquely hopeless and insurmountable. He\u2019s manipulating you with his sulkiness. Never try and point this out though, you\u2019ll just end up hating him and yourself. I don't want to to say never help any friend in need, but set boundaries that there is a time and a place for when you can help. Don\u2019t play along by trying to fix the problem without an explicit limit on how much time and energy you can extend. If stuck, give empathetic but *un*helpful responses- \u201coh that sucks\u201d. **Confronting paggro \u201cjokes\u201d, hints and backhanded comments.** The spotting technique for dealing with passive aggressiveness and paggro 'jokes' can help: It goes something like this. Toxic person makes a passive aggressive joke or comment. <You>: \"It sounds like you\u2019re upset\u201d' Toxic person denies it vehemently (\"oh I'm only joking, lighten up\") <You>: \"ok then! Just a thought I had. I'm probably wrong. Silly me.\" Basically the key is that when you respond to their comment, it has to be extremely not-angry and not-defensive. Almost like as neutral an observation as you can make it. Use neutral language (it seems like, it looks like, it sounds like) Don't use \"I think that\" which is unmistakably a personal challenge. Point out that it 'sounds like they're upset/concerned' but don't say that they *are* angry or upset or jealous, just that the *signals* that they're acting so. When they deny the ill intent (they will) don't try and corner them. Give them an out. You want to hold a mirror up to them in a way that says *I see you motherfucker, I see what you're doing*, but not be so aggressive with it that you get drawn into a conflict. Either they admit what they\u2019re bitter about and it can be dealt with openly, or at the very least once their tactic has been 'seen' they have to switch to a different one. If you want a role model for this, think the TV detective Columbo. He keeps suspects off guard with his jovial, harmless and self effacing demeanour. The Columbo tone is gently challenging but not accusatory. Almost like you're testing a theory. It\u2019s often necessary to focus on a specific action of theirs to uncover what they\u2019re doing (if they\u2019re rolling their eyes or sighing or looking at the time or some other subtle non verbal show of disinterest for example, say explicitly \u201care you comfortable here? I ask because you\u2019re looking at the time\u201d). This is called **holding up a mirror**. I cant emphasise enough it needs to be done very dispassionately and non-aggressively though. Heres another possible response: PA makes a comment. You, *raised eyebrows*: \u201coh wow, ouch\u201d Nothing else. No explanation. Keep it dry. Just something that hints that they\u2019ve gone too far but in a way that can\u2019t be painted as an overreaction on your part. It can be a tension relief for you just to express \u201couch\u201d at a jab jabs least. **Dealing with exhausting requests for help** One trick that you can use to stonewall demands for help with logistical questions. The king of stonewalling questions is *\u201dI'm sorry. How am I supposed to do that?\u201d* Don't say it in an irritated way, try and phrase your question in a way that suggests innocently, I'm *sorry* but help me understand, what are you asking? How do you expect me to fulfill what you\u2019re asking of me? Logistical steps please. How, what, when, what next, what are you aiming to get from this etc The goal is to: a) if they\u2019re asking you for a favour, get them to have to openly *ask what they want*, rather than just nudging you into thanklessly doing it. (Passive aggressives love the \u201cnon ask\u201d where they just sulk until you agree to do something, then when you expect gratitude in return then well...they never *asked* you to do it) B) get them thinking about the logistics of the situation themselves, and trying to solve the problem with their energy (if this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it\u2019s fundamentally similar to what PAs often do to you, nudging you into solving their problems by being useless at it). Asking questions also sends the subtle hint that you\u2019ve been asked to do something difficult and unfair (again, this is something PA might often do to imply this to you) c) Make asking you for shit he could just find out himself more difficult and unsatisfying than just doing it. Asking questions to stimulate engagement is a technique which you'll often see teachers employing on little kids who ask 'why' a lot. \"Why?\" is a subtly paggro question in itself (kids know this, which is why they ask it). Stick to \"how\", and \"what\"-practical questions that move towards solutions. **If they\u2019re really giving you a headache** \u201cI want some time to think about what you\u2019ve said\u201d is a good way to gain some temporary breathing space from needy emotional vampires to think about what to say next and not let it devolve into an accusation match (you'll lose). It\u2019s hard for someone to complain about taking what they\u2019ve said seriously. If you need to call a PA out on a behaviour, focus on the *specific behaviour* (i.e their lateness) and how it makes you feel, don't overwhelm them by get drawn into criticising their pattern of behaviour or saying stuff like \"why are you always like this?\" which is always a phrase which sends an argument into the toilet. In summary, with passive aggressives: * Avoid using punishment, never get angry at them, they thrive on evoking unpleasant reactions in you that make you look like the asshole and will rebel against criticism with a barrage of plausible sounding excuses. If you have to call them out on their behaviour, express confusion with their actions and words not anger, or perfect your \u201cI\u2019m not mad, just disappointed\u201d father tone. * Never step in and do their responsibilities for them no matter how uselessly they flail at it and sulk. * *Boring* them with a dull or unsatisfying reaction is a more effective punishment than condemning them. Use opportunity costs wherever possible. Opportunity costs should never be referred to explicitly as punishment, just unfortunate necessities that raise the price of messing up. Whoops you failed to turn up on time? Well you missed the deadline so I left already. Failed to do the task? Now you have to do the tedious backup thing sorry. Get creative here- Paperwork and meetings and busywork. (The problem here is that this is easier to enforce from a manager than peer perspective but I\u2019m sure you can think of some \u201cprice\u201d for your time) * Don\u2019t try to convince them by appealing to \u201ctheir own good\u201d. Paradoxically despite how selfish they come across as this doesn\u2019t work. **Their key emotional driver isn\u2019t actually selfishness in the traditional sense, it\u2019s their fear and hatred of other people\u2019s expectations of them.** They\u2019d rather cut off their nose to spite their face than do something someone else is telling them is \u201cfor their own good\u201d. (this is something kids learn early in childhood, when mother says \"you\u2019ve got to study for your future\" you can rebel by devaluing yourself, by not *caring* about your future! Who are you to make decisions about whats good for me?). For a PA self-defeat and martyring is the height of virtue. A PA will routinely act *against* their self-interest if it maintains their sense of autonomy. * Get used to \u201cillness as metaphor\u201d PAs will frequently fall sick with vague somatic complaints when they need to. Don\u2019t call them out as liars, 99% of the time the sickness will have some degree of truth. And getting them to try and admit exaggeration will just make you the villain. (Their conception of self is so poor *they* don't even know why they're sick, or that their vague anxiety is actually repressed anger.). Speak in terms of results not intention \u201cit\u2019s terrible that your vague somatic complaint is acting up again, you\u2019re very brave...but since you can\u2019t deliver the results I\u2019ve had to go with someone else sorry\u201d * Don\u2019t make plans with them as a critical piece without a backup plan. * Make all agreements as explicit as possible, never operate on unspoken agreements. They are masters of ignoring the unspoken rule everyone else abides by. Also if you get a favour from them *always* balance your cheque. They tend to be very sensitive to perceived \u201c(un)fairness\u201d. * Reinforce that it\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d to you. They tend to say yes to stuff they don\u2019t want to do with their words then say \u201cno\u201d with their stalling actions. * **Praise them and use positive reinforcement when they act mature and responsible or do something you appreciate.** Tell them explicitly what makes you happy and praise them when they do it. It\u2019s hard praising someone who gives you a headache but they often relish opportunities to show how nice they can be and *desperately* crave praise. (This is likely what their parents did NOT do, they focused on criticising their child when they did wrong rather than building a sense of pride in doing things right). When you understand that people act passive aggressively because they feel either trapped, or unappreciated, then you understand their emotional levers. If you *really* want to help a PA (a tiring and thankless job) this is your role: training them towards productive behaviours, and removing the payoff from disruptive ones. Remember they will do whatever you teach them gets a reaction. * If this person shows no signs of change and is a friend seriously consider how much they add to your life. If they\u2019re an employee enforce company rules on lateness until they quit, if they\u2019re a relative you have my condolences. <Sources>: The Passive Aggressive Personality - Max E.

However, by the time I get over it, it feels like everyone has made their minds up about me being unfriendly. I recently got bed bugs and the inspector thought I got them from my internship in a nursing home. I told my supervisor this and they did not find any; now it seems there's a subtext that he doesn't believe anything I say or thinks I am just stirring the pot for attention. I try to stay positive and not say anything bad about any one, but I've found that usually puts me on the 'out' group. I'm never sure if I'm the problem or the people I'm around in the workplace are. Any thoughts?<simcity4000>: I added an addendum", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 15.0}

I haven't had a close friend in a long time and I always find myself with no one to talk to or hang out with. Advice? [deleted]<tiffythebomb>: The older you become, the harder it will be to make friends. Patience is key. If you look at someone who is \u201cpopular\u201d or friends with the popular crowd, chances are that most of their friends are just acquaintances too. (I saw your other comment.) Check FB for local young figure skaters, maybe a group near you. If there aren\u2019t any, start a group! Have a meet up in a public place, you\u2019ll find that you guys have a lot to talk about. Even if your group only has 4 or 5 people in it, that\u2019s 4 or 5 potential new friends. Make sure your skating instructor knows about your new FB group, and can tell other people to join too. You only need one good friend. Don\u2019t worry about having too many, just find one who fulfills your needs as a friend. When you\u2019re meeting your new potential friends, don\u2019t tell them you\u2019re actively seeking new friends, fake it till you make it. Be the person you want to be (out going, adventurous, ect.) Don\u2019t be the person your old friends expect you to be. Good luck! <ditsobeh>: Haha, unfortunately I'm in the top skating class and I'm pretty much the only one who's my age, everyone else who is already goes to my school. Rest of the advice is pretty solid, thank you. <tiffythebomb>: Good for you, that\u2019s impressive! You could apply this to any of your interests, paiting, photography, a TV show you\u2019re obsessed with, ect. I\u2019ve made some of my best friends from meet ups in local Facebook groups. Good luck! You sound like you\u2019re going to have a successful life ahead of you.

Alright. So, there is a girl at my school. She's a grade below me (grade 11), we met like two months ago and talked a few times (by that i mean two great 10min conversations and i spent some time every few days at her table making smalltalk). I really enjoy talking to her and tried to become her friend. Anyway There was an event at our school last week where we could buy chocolate SantaClauses and give them to other people. I bought one and wanted to give it to her, but i didn't meet her and could talk to her, so instead i wrote a note that said something along the lines of \"you're really nice and i just wanted to make you feel good, so i bought you this\", but a little more detailed. It definitely didn't have any over-the-top content. I taped it to the santa. During lunch break i walked up to her table, placed it in front of her (she had 4 friends with her) and because i was insanely nervous and scared, i pretty much ran away. I did not see her reaction or that of her friends, but i was told by someone who watched that they all read the note and didn't seem pissed or laugh at me or the note, but were probably confused and overwhelmed. She and 2 of these 4 other ppl later walked past me. They did not confront me about it, but looked at me (for a VERY long time). It's been a week. I haven't talked to her yet and i still have no idea how badly i messed this up and what to do. I tried to get an opportunity to talk to her alone but it hasn't worked yet. Sometimes i notice her looking at me (not in a negative way but she isn't smiling either). I \"know\" one of the other girls from that table and when she walked past me in the hallways today, she \"interacted\" with me pretty much (but not exactly) the same way she did before the santa thing: she noticed me, smiled and said hi in passing. Is that a good sign or nah? What am i supposed to do? Will confronting the recipient of the santa make it better or worse? <Btw>: 1. I do not have a crush on her, even though i am aware that everyone, including the girl herself, probably think that 2. Yes, i am aware that the santa thing was stupid, especially the running away part, but i guess my brain cells left my body because of how terrified i was 3. I hope you can actually understand this text because my thoughts are all over the place and i have no idea if what i wrote makes sense Anyway, thanks already for your help <WhatAboutTheMilk>: That\u2019s was really sweet of you. Just try to be yourself. You are over thinking it. She may think you like her but don\u2019t sweat it. Just continue to be friendly. <DeadIronGolem>: Yes, i'm super overthinking it :/ literally the second i left the room after i gave her the santa, i felt the doom coming and imagined several worst case scenarios and all of their consequences in my head. Ended up sitting on the stairs nearly shivering for a few minutes. It's something i always do, i always do something or have something happen to me and spend the next week(s) losing my shit over it because i keep imagining how the people involved in the situation now hate me and want to never talk to me again. Even if the situation turns out absolutely fine. I have no idea how to get rid of it. It's most likely a trauma thing from the bad bullying during my early childhood. Thanks for saying it was sweet. I honestly ASSUME she thinks i have a huge crush on her. It would make sense to her on so many levels, not just with the santa. It doesn't really bother me that she thinks it, because i know i can just explain to her how it really is if i need to (i get ridiculous attached to people that are super nice to me, like she was). I hope i can be friendly without many problems... she is hard to talk to since she's almost always in a group or with her best friend. <WhatAboutTheMilk>: Oh man I know what you mean about your mind running scenarios. That\u2019ll mess with you pretty good. You can get control of it though. You have to be conscious of your thought process. Instead of thinking about what could happen you force yourself to go through this scenario of what you want to happen and what the different positive outcomes could be. It takes a long time to retrain yourself but look at it this way, you\u2019re what, late teens? So your mind has been working this way for 10 or so years? It\u2019s going to take awhile to change something you\u2019ve been doing subconsciously for that long. I\u2019ll pm you a link for a book that helped me. <DeadIronGolem>: Thank you!

When I was little I had no problems communicating with my peers at all until I became about 12 years old when we stopped playing with each other and began to talk instead. I don't know why but I found it really difficult talking to my classmates and I felt lonely but didn't think about it too much. Then I began high school (at thirteen years old) where I really never talked much. The only people that I said anything to were my closest friends, 2 of them which I\u2019ve had since first grade and another one who I met when I began highschool. But I even had, and still have, trouble talking to them and it was impossible for me to hold conversations to the other people in my class. I felt lonely but didn't really care about it at first because I was obsessed with cartoons and games at the time but when I was 14 and started 8th grade I began too notice how weird I was. This year I moved to secondary school which meant that I had to start a new class without my closest friends being in the same class (we still go to the same school, but we never have classes together) and had to get to know new people. I thought that this could be my chance to redeem myself and get to know my new classmates and start new friendships, but I couldn't because of my lack of communication skills and weirdness. The thing is I never know what to say or how to say stuff. When I try to talk with people, I often end up saying things at the wrong time, stuff that just are inappropriate or repeat the same thing over and over again and I never notice this until I've said it. I stay quiet instead of saying anything so people will think of my as the quiet girl instead of the weird girl. But this really isn't working as I've heard that people think that I'm weird in a bad way. I always compare myself with how other people talk and behave with each other, (as an example, I often eat with my closest friend and her friends and they talk a lot with each other while I'm just sitting there which makes me think I'm really boring &amp; weird) and I try to mimic them but it doesn't work out. All of this makes me really scared of the future because I know I won\u2019t be able to get friends or a partner and I really don\u2019t want to be all alone when I become an adult even though I really want to have a normal life. I feel really weird and don't think I was meant to live as a human and often think that I would be better off dead. I\u2019m sorry if I wrote too much or badly, English is my second language and I\u2019m generally bad at explaining things.

Lastly, try going on some online video chats and see if you could hold a conversation.<Leulera>: Lol that'd make most people with average social skills shit their pants.

In a few years time I won't care about anything at all...<EnoughReserve>: My god, I've had similar thoughts before, but that has to be one of the most depressing outlook I've heard in awhile. A life like that would be unbearably empty and some part of you knows that. I've tried not caring, killing off every emotion because it just hurt too much and 7 years later I'm still trying to turn it all back on and fight against the developed instict to not feel. I wish i had advice to give you and the poster because I can understand and relate to both, if i did I'd be in a better situation to deal with my own, but accepting that your emotions are off isn't the answer. <artinum>: It wasn't really a conscious decision. It was the result of growing up learning that any emotional reaction was a Bad Thing. Any negative emotions were bad, and I had a LOT of those. But positive emotions are also bad - if you show enthusiasm for something, you'll be ridiculed for it. If you show kindness or empathy, you were weak. Interestingly, adults punish you for negativity and your peers punish you for positivity. In the end, it's easiest not to react to anything.<EnoughReserve>: You are right in that, people will ridicule and punish you for feeling, that's probably never going to change. People want everything to be easy and simple, for everyone to be \"cool\" and composed because it doesn't rock the boat and they won't have to think about what they really want as individuals. So it is easiest to not react to anything, but its also empty. Not feeling, not being true to yourself it denies you every chance for fulfillment or joy and so much else. The truth is that every emotion you feel is yours and is for a reason, even deep dispare and consuming rage is a good thing when you know its real. For me, I lost..so much and endured so much pain, parts of me started to fade away as I tried to endure. At some point I just accepted that they couldn't come back and that it would be better if i wasn't here at all. I became a walking corpse, I still am, and it hurt the few people i care about more than i could have known, but I want to fight. I want to come back to who I was before even if it means pain because nothing is worse than this empty haze. Its a struggle, and so much more so if you are alone like I am, but it IS worth it. People may see it as weak to feel things but it takes strength to feel and not run from it, and the people who matter will see that.", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 2.0}

I used to be pretty social as a kid (almost extroverted, even), but then I hit puberty I became so insecure that I gradually lost the ability to talk to people... As a result (and probably due to some other reasons too), I wasn't able to make any friends upon entering high school and have now been alone for over four years. During that time, I barely ever talked to anyone (besides my mother) and my social skills just kept worsening. After some therapy and becoming more optimistic about my life, I feel a lot better than I used to and would like to get my social life back. The problem, though, is that I *cannot* talk to people. When I try, I either blank out completely or just say the most standard, boring shit I can think of. This may very well have to do with a lack of topics (I dislike most mainstream media, don't ever do anything exciting and though I have various hobbies and interests, I'm not particularly passionate about any of them (except for science, maybe, but I don't feel like I know enough about it to discuss it with confidence)), but my nearly nonexistent social skills probably play a big part in it too and I feel like practice should be the best way to remedy that problem. I don't how how to do that either though. Am I just supposed to start a conversation with someone, despite the high (speaking from experience) risk of fucking it up? Just take a chance and hope that it might actually go well? I think so, but I'm very afraid of it. What if it works as negative reinforcement and I become unwilling to talk to people again? That isn't really an excuse, but teh fear still makes me avoid it endlessly... Is there some kind of easier way to do it, or should I just go for it regardless of how scared I am? If so, do you have any tips for trying to hold a conversation with people you don't really have anything in common with and avoiding deathly silences and intensely awkward moments while doing so? Also, *how the fuck* do you meet new people? Even as a kid, it seems like social situations just came to me. I'd just be playing somewhere and - out of nowhere - I'd easily find someone to talk to. Nowadays, though, that's not gonna happen. At the moment, all the people my age I ever interact with are my classmates (who have mostly ignored me for four years now). I live in a rural town, there aren't a lot of people, all available extracurricular activities (don't know if that's the right term in English, I mean things like sports teams to join, courses you can do in your free time etc.) are either sports (which I suck at) or music (which I'm not the least bit interested in) and the closest even semi-big city is over an hour away (by train). Add to that that I am a somewhat \"unique\" person (fun fact, my teachers actually called me this regularly back in middle school (and not in a good way, either; hahaha, it still hurts-)) and finding anyone within my interest group in real life (I think it'd be easier to talk to them) seems almost impossible. Which makes me wonder how people meet online. If I want to meet someone, should I just hang around forums and hope someone nice person comes along or try to approach someone that seems interesting? (This is the first post on any social media platform (does reddit even count as social media?) I've made in years, so I don't know how people actually behave on here...) I'm generally a smart person (this may not sound all that good, but I'm basically my country's version of a straight-A student, which should count for something?) and am interested in science, art (visual), comics (by which I mostly mean manga, but I also read manhwa and manhua occasionally, so, you know. Sadly, I'm not into popular stuff like AoT, BnHa etc. (basically Shonen in general)), philosophy (from a scientific standpoint) and stories (which means books, I guess...). Are there any good places to chat about this type of stuff? Thanks in advance for any advice, I'd really appreciate it. &amp;#x200B;<zimba_fuel>: First off it's great that you've taken the step of posting considering you don't normally do that, so well done, that's a good start. You should definitely try and start conversations with people as it's the only way to practice. You must realize that if you don't then you're never going to change or improve. You've got nothing to lose and you need to adopt this attitude. Before you start doing this I'd suggest learning some things about conversations so you actually have something to practice. One thing that keeps coming up here is that you should be curious about the other person and ask them questions about themselves, so straight away that's one thing for you to try. However I'd suggest reading some social skills books to get more tips on how to start and keep conversations going. My suggestion is \"Improve Your Social Skills\" by Daniel Wendler. As for your question on how to meet new people, well try not to focus too much on this. You want improve your social skills and you can do this with existing people that are around you. Take a chance and try have a brief conversation with a classmate to practice a new conversational skill that you've learned. Talk to the shop assistant or someone standing in a queue, you've got nothing to lose here. As you build up your skills and confidence you can get braver and try new activities you wouldn't normally consider or use a site like meetup.com Best of luck SlimyFrog7! <SlimyFrog7>: I guess the meeting new people thing was because I'm really sick of being alone at this point, but I guess I shouldn't make it into a priority - practice comes first.

I have an idea of who I am and for example, how I sound and how I appear to other people -- and how I act. However when I've had a chance to see recordings of myself, what's on the recording differs from how I perceived myself. And sometimes I cringe because of this difference. Quite a lot of times, when I'm interacting with a person I find myself emulating some person. Either that's a person who I want to emulate at that point, or I just whatever thing that person did to my interlocutor. And I realize that the interlocutor I'm interacting with isn't seeing the person I'm emulating, but *me trying to emulate that person*. Is emulating normal? I suppose this issue boils down to how I express myself, and how I have an idea in my head of how people see me but that's not really how people see me. Is any of this a problem? If so, how do I fix it?<ErebusEntity>: Be unapologetically you. Others judgements shouldn't factor in, they will have them regardless of how you act. Become comfortable with the fact that you are not validated by the opinions of others, positive or negative. The you that is yourself when no one is around is the person you are, and they don't need a mask to hide behind because they are real. As for social interaction, we all have different aspects of our personality that come through in different situations. We as individuals have to be able to gauge for ourselves when we cross over from self expression into mimicry. Emulation of others isn't uncommon or unusual because in actuality you are simply trying to personify the character traits you admire in that person. But the goal is to integrate the traits into our own persona through time and understanding. If you simply act like someone else the traits you admire will always be \"theirs\" because you are expressing them as if you were that person, not genuinely as yourself. Don't play the role, absorb them, keep what you like, discard the rest.<racer5001>: Thanks for your response! I think you articulate what I'm trying to say well: \"trying to personify the character traits I admire in that person.\" If I could assk you some follow-up qs, how do I absorb them? How do I ensure that I'm being \"me\" -- or am I navel-gazing too much and should focus on doing and completing what I'm trying to do? ^for example, as I'm writing this reply, I don't really have a sense of self -- I'm just trying to finish this reply. Maybe this is the fundamental problem, I'm trying to create a sense of self -- maybe sometimes that's not needed...?<ErebusEntity>: The only way you can find yourself is by knowing yourself. Take time away from others and do some things on your own. Find out what makes you happy or excited or curious about the world when no one else is involved. As above so below, as within so without. We can learn everything we need to know about both ourselves and the world by looking inside and introspectively learning about who we are and what moves us. Just by having these thoughts and concerns you are already doing the work, keep it up and you will achieve your goals.<racer5001>: Again, thank you for your encouragement and advice.

From a 21y guy Hi, I'm a 21 years male college student that have been struggling those past months thinking if I know \"how to live\". My daily life is going to college, eat at home or grandparents, go to gym and use computer to play games, read/watch things. It's literally this, everyday. Sometimes (monthly) I go to a friend's house to hang there with 4-5 college friends (all male). Around two times I go to college parties every semester. And that's it. I've been thinking if it's because my sheltered upbringing. I still live my parents, and they aren't the kind of people that go out much. My mother goes out to work or to groceries store and my father go to work and church. They rarely go out to hang out with friends (talking about once a year). Studied only on private schools (which I'm grateful) and now I'm on a public university, where I'm realizing how things truly works. Only around the age of 15y I \"learned\" to say thank you, good morning, because of my friends. Only at 18y I learned how to understand the financial struggles of some people, because of the people at the university. Only at 20y I cooked something by myself (a terrible hamburger btw). And it goes on. The sudden change from high-school to the \"variety\" of college confused me. It felt like everyone knew how to live by himself, drink lots of beer and go to clubs/bar. And I drank my first beer at 18y. I still never went to a bar. My idea of hanging out is to watch a movie or go to someone's house. When I was a child, my mother pressured me to eat when I didn't want, because of this and always eating at home, I have social anxiety when eating with people that aren't my parents. Beucae of that, I don't eat outside. Every thing related to sex I learned from internet (how to use condom, what to do/what not to do), even though I'm a virgin. Same thing about how a healthy relationship works (my mother defend the idea that the girl need to know how to cook and clean everything). In other words, I think my parents taught me how to be a good son, not a good (independent) person. Now, is it me that failed to learn how to live or the way I was created? Just to have an idea, my older brother have been recently dating a girl (first time) and my parents are freaking out. Judging her for the different color hair, that my brother spend the night at her house. He has terrible social skills with stranger people. If my parents disappeared over night, I don't think me or my brother would survive of how dependant we are. I'm using Tinder but combine my boring life, Asian, short guy (5'5), low self esteem, social anxiety when eating, and I haven't been successful. I did randomly got a hook up with an older girl, but the logistic didn't help (both live with parents). Now, the only thing I do is play games. I don't play alone though, I like to play with friends. And I think I like to use the computer because it's the only place I can feel free,to do whatever I want. The only moment I don't have social anxiety and actually enjoy a food is when I'm late at night at the computer. I could go on, but it's probably getting confused. Now I'm on vacation, only going to gym and playing games. I want to go out with someone. But I don't know where to go, what to do if I found someone on tinder. What can I do? How to recover from lack of social skill? Im the one that is doing wrong or my parents? Sorry for long and confusing text (could have been muuuch longer though haha). I don't if I will find help here. Maybe it's to get it off my chest.<lebalder>: you, my friend, suffer from narcissistic parenting, the only way to improve is to stop it and recognize the your parent's opinion about you doesn't define you. is a good thing that you have some friends to hang out with, most people with narcissistic parents don't have any. You should use them as an excuse to go out and learn more about how to move around (further and further away) and start making some money on your own. what you will have to learn the most is that to accept you parents you don't have to take the kind of relationship they want to push into you. Set your own limits and know what you can ignore about their behavior. Become more independent in advance in case things go awry (I guess there are some parents that would push their offspring away if things don't go as they want). also, don't worry so much, you need a lot of embarrassment to learn, and people underestimate just how much they can get away with<bean7797>: Thanks for the reply.

After the shots I felt tipsy and said some things that I regret including the fact that the manager I don't directly work under found out I didn't want to work on certain projects (which isn't true, I was just listing projects and I was kind of tipsy so had no responsible response), and that I had said something about his appearance which one of my dick co-workers told him to his face.

They are neither freinds or family. think about yourself and what you want, not what others think, because in the long run, they propably dont know themselves. 3. most people really dont care about what someone is doing, too busy thinking about their own plans and insecurities. mby it will be a funny story with no ill intent for a while but that's it.<CrestedSegment>: You make good points.

Used it and abused it for the same reasons. Got off of it a year and a half a go and had to completely relearn life. Relearn who I was and everything. I did not feel like a person. I realized my entire fake \"social\" personality was based off a drug. 17 years of who I thought I was down the drain.<youngjak>: I\u2019m going through this right now and it\u2019s fucken awful, realizing that I\u2019m a two different people adderall me and non adderall me. And I don\u2019t know which one is actually me<abigfuckingnope>: Still here. It's gotten slightly better but still figuring it out.

I can relate to a bit of your comment but I'm also, perhaps, foolishly curious about experimenting with stimulants to combat social anxiety.<youngjak>: I\u2019m better now than I was definitely. Your mindset matters a lot on it. Like my crashes are not as bad now. Well started working out and stuff too try to get some good natural dopamine going(not the constant artificial adderall kind) working out helps out a lot. I put myself in situations where I have to speak and challenged myself. So instead of sitting alone during two study halls i sit with a group of girls now. I still have mood swings just not as bad. Some days I\u2019m more robotic than others. And I\u2019m still nervous quite often(I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder). But for you specifically about stimulants to combat anxiety. I would say it does the opposite. But still it\u2019s so weird cause it goes through phases. One phases I\u2019m so happy and confident without a care I\u2019m the world. And the next I\u2019m overthinking everything and nervous as shit. So if you want to combat anxiety with stimulants personally I would say it\u2019s inconsistent", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 2.2857142857}

I find myself constantly struggling to handle negative comments or constructive criticism even over the smallest things. I'm not generally someone who takes themselves too seriously, I have no problem with friends joking at my expense and don't get offended easily in most situations. But sometimes I'll have to actively suppress the urge to get immediately defensive over a minor thing a friend or acquaintance said. It always catches me off guard, too. I've tried figuring out if there's a pattern or a specific subject I'm touchy about, but I've found no common denominator. I guess it's more that I am sometimes already feeling down and talking down to myself, and during those times, any lighthearted comment someone makes about me will be perceived as negative by my subconscious. I know that my friends have noticed this and will avoid making certain comments around me when I'm in one of these moods. I want to tell them they are free to be themselves around me and I don't want them treating me differently because of my own insecurities, but I don't know how to say that. I hate that this makes them feel uncomfortable and I would like to change this behavior. Does anyone know of any strategies I could use to learn to be less defensive in situations, to better handle criticism and to be easier on myself when I'm feeling down? I'll accept suggestions on books, articles, podcasts etc on the subject too. Any help is welcome! Thanks in advance. TL;DR: when I'm feeling bad I get very sensitive about anything and it makes conversation with friends awkward because they feel like they have to walk on eggshells around me. How can I avoid doing this?<trysummoningdemons>: Epistemology. How do they know if they're right or wrong when they criticize? They're not you, and the heuristics they believe apply to what you should do in your life to achieve success, are simply heuristics that may have worked for them in memorable situations, or that they're guessing could help you out in situations they haven't personally experienced. If you like, your goal could be to \"doubt them\" - to hold what they're saying mentally at arm's length, to just regard their remarks without instantly accepting or rejecting them as truth. What the people around you are criticizing you about are heuristic suggestions to do something else. (...or, less charitably to these people, they might be complaining after the fact with 20/20 hindsight about the outcomes of a judgment call under uncertainty which you reasonably made. But hey.) Sure, it's ok to perceive the comments as negative. What happens if you're negatively commented upon? You said you feel defensive about it. Alright. That's fine. It's ok to feel defensive and to defend yourself. You're making decisions now and then about heuristics to use, and people nearby might criticize your choices. But you're alright. We don't need to pick optimal heuristics and carry them out with optimal efficiency. Are you sure your friends are on eggshells around you? Maybe when you're feeling bad, they perceive how you feel, react sympathetically, and go easier on you / choose to be present with you because they're kind, and because your choice of heuristics isn't always that important. We don't have to call their care for you walking on eggshells. It doesn't feel great to feel bad, why rub it in and make you calculate alternatives, increasing your stress, when there's no need? If you want advice from your friends when you sense that they're being nice to you due to your evident mood, then just ask 'em for the advice directly. It's alright to get your heartrate up when your hear criticism. Grin like a maniac. Revel in it. uh, was any of that good? I want to get my heartrate up<sharonaflemming>: Oh, I guess I never thought of it that way before. I believe the part about \"doubting\" what they say will be especially important in my journey to change this - I always immediately internalize the criticism as true.

I quickly went to say Hi to a guy whom I knew from another job, I turn around, and they're gone. Nobody answers their phone. Nobody wants to know. I feel terrible. I don't know what to do.

It's hard to explain, I don't think I can word it right. I have aspergers syndrome and can pick up enough social cues to know I'm seen as different by them. I'm not aggressive, ever, and I'm generally very chill. I'm not very funny but I try and keep myself involved in a conversation. <UPDATE>: Hi people. After EDIT 3 I got home, hugged my SO and slept for nearly 12 hours. This thread got pretty big and all I can say is thanks. I'm still hurt, and emotionally confused as heck, but I'll be OK. Some redditors have suggested I take a long look in the mirror at myself, which may suck in the short term but there we go. So many thanks from me to you. You wonderful people of reddit.<Vitalic123>: \\&gt; Sorry I posted this here. I didn't know where else to post it. That's alright man. Anyway, that sounds really tough. It's very difficult to not take something like that personally. You can either try anyway, and assume there was no ill-intent. Or you can look at it as an affirmation of where you're at with them, in that they just see you as a colleague, and get friends elsewhere. But that's something you're gonna have to figure out for yourself. As to how you'll face them on Monday? Professionally, no more, no less. Don't mention the party if they don't. If they do, or god forbid, if they ask \"where did you go, man\", or something like that, just matter-of-factly say \"You guys kinda left me behind. Made me feel like crap.\", or something to that effect. Important to not be accusatory or too emotional, but just state it as a fact. That's basically all you can do, imo.<mheyk>: dont even mention the feeling like crap part just say you met up with an old BC and one thing lead to another <Black_Robin>: Best answer. They probably didn't even mean to leave him behind. He should not play the victim role, it happened, it sucked, but for the good of his professional relationships and ongoing personal growth, the narrative should be he lost them, and not the other way around. <Edit>: I assume I\u2019m getting downvoted because I said they probably didn\u2019t mean to leave him behind, yet I realise OP mentioned they ignored his calls too, and the fact that he had organised a lot of it made it extra shitty for them to leave him. I agree with the downvoting on this basis and I apologise for how I worded it. It can happen though that if people are drunk, they become forgetful and insensitive, following the pack in a herd like mentality, and making bad decisions. No excuse, but that may have played a part. What I said about OP\u2019s narrative going forward though I still believe holds true, and is in line with the precious posters opinion ie. don\u2019t mention it on Monday, there\u2019s no point, unless it\u2019s to a trusted confidant <happymomma40>: They didn\u2019t mean to leave him behind but wouldn\u2019t answer his calls? I\u2019m going to call bs on that one. He isn\u2019t playing the victim. He clearly stated he know he\u2019s different. However they ghosted him after he did a lot of work for them. That makes them shitty people. They could have just said yeah we are going to head home or something. <Black_Robin>: Yeah good points. What I meant, and probably not articulated well, is that it probably wouldn\u2019t do much good to make a point of being victimised at work on Monday. Like someone else said, might be best just to put up a facade that everything is ok at work. Either that or ask a trusted confident at work what happened and why they ditched him. I\u2019m not trying to belittle him or rub salt, just offer an opinion on how to maybe deal with it going forward, understanding that it also did In fact suck <happymomma40>: That\u2019s true. If they ghosted him there is really no point in talking to them at all. They are assholes and not worth the time. OP if you read this. These people are not your friends.

There are many times when they say something which i think they expect me to laugh at but i get no emotional reaction to what they have said. It makes me a feel a bit robotic. I also feel like i am just some smiling observer of the conversation, i don't really know how to add to the conversation and just feel like some creepy sentinel hovering in the room. Does anyone else have this, and have you managed to do something about it? &amp;#x200B; Thanks<elk227>: Is it just general apathy and numbness or a disinterest in the conversation topic? Or sometimes you want to say something but maybe you think it\u2019s so obvious and common knowledge that it\u2019s pointless to say? Or is it that you think they wouldn\u2019t care about what you said? <thornphoenix>: Its not really numbness its more like an absence of clarity, there is no instinctual or knowledgeable idea of what to do with next. I want to say something but i don't have any idea what to say that would help the conversation, sometimes i can ask a question but it seems forced and really only increases the speed that the conversation comes to an end. I don't think that they don't care what i would say, its just a lack of idea of what to say next, like its my turn to hit the ball in this conversational tennis but i have turned up without a racket and minor head trauma. <elk227>: \u201cits just a lack of idea of what to say next, like its my turn to hit the ball in this conversational tennis but i have turned up without a racket and minor head trauma.\u201d I know I shouldn\u2019t, but I did giggle aloud when you described it like that. Hmm...the times when I didn\u2019t know what to say is when someone tells me something and I don\u2019t know what to make of the information\u2014like why are you telling me this and what do you want me to do with this information? Like do you want me to find a solution? Does it relate and build on to something that person or I have said previously? Does the person just need to vent to someone or organize their thoughts? Sometimes I get slightly irate if I can\u2019t categorize it, but then this too is an opportunity to ask about it for clarity, which I remind myself after the fact but in the moment, since I\u2019m so used to trying to figure stuff out on my own, it doesn\u2019t come naturally. Other times, am I bored by the overall situation, company or topic or distracted by inner thoughts? Or am I just not comfortable enough with the situation to accept the rate of conversation? I guess what I mean is have other people complained of your lack of communication? Do you worry you\u2019re boring them? If you\u2019re less talkative and everyone else is doing the talking they may think you\u2019re a good listener and may not notice who\u2019s doing most of the talking or even find it problematic? Or maybe you have several thoughts but don\u2019t know which to go with? You mention not knowing what to say to help the conversation, but maybe it\u2019s pinpointing the point of the conversation as I sort of mentioned above? Also, reiterating what they said in your own words can help because they think you\u2019ve listened, but they can also correct and clarify your understanding since everyone describes things differently and uses language differently. Not sure if any of this helped you, but for what it\u2019s worth, I think you\u2019re not a bad conversationalist. Oh and that reminds me, maybe it\u2019s because you need longer to compose your thoughts? Like you may be an eloquent communicator in written conversations than actual talking conversations? I mean I know I definitely need some time to process my thoughts and it\u2019s perfectly fine to say you need time if that\u2019s the case. As for the joke, not everyone\u2019s humor is the same so it\u2019s fine to just polite laugh or be confused (which could lead to a longer conversation when they explain it).<thornphoenix>: \" I know I shouldn\u2019t, but I did giggle aloud when you described it like that.\" Thanks :) \"Maybe it's because you need longer to compose your thoughts?\" I think this might be it. Once a conversation is over then I have usually thought enough about it to be able to say something, sometimes i am lucky that the conversation is still going on and the context is enough for me to say what i have just thought up. But i am not always that fortunate. Thank you for your reply and for taking the time to do so. I have some new things to think about. I think that I need to stop being so aware of my lack of speaking and focus on the conversation at hand, try and figure out better ways to continue the conversation via repeating what they said back to them in their own words (like they said) or being able to ask questions so that i can take the time to formulate a response whilst they are asking the questions. <Rkikkas>: The advice I can offer you is to focus on the task at hand and don't get lost in your thoughts with it.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 4.5}

Is there anything I can do more to really hold the attention and interest of someone while speaking?<thatbatcat>: Whenever anyone talks to me about themselves, even if I want to talk about myself, I lean in and listen closely. I really am interested about what they're saying, even if it wasn't wasn't what I wanted to talk about as by listening and asking appropriate questions, I'm improving our relationship, both by learning more about them and by establishing myself as someone they love to be around. This will yield returns. People love talking about themselves, and in turn, they love those who listen to them talking about themselves. As you keep listening, and engage with them about things they care about, your relationship will improve and this will make you far more important to them, and they'll be so much more likely to do things for you, but they'll repay you in their own way. It's unfortunate that those currently around you don't seem to want to listen to you, or maybe you're just picking up on the fact that it's a rare man who prefers to listen than to speak. Either way though, from my perspective, this is brilliant news! As seems that you can easily improve your relationships with all your close family and friends, just by listening! To answer your question though, perhaps you are just there to hear. I'm sure your friends and family would be fine to listen to you, but if they aren't interested, it'll be awkward for the both of you. That's too bad. I must stress though that I'd really recommend listening to them regardless in order to maximise returns on your relationships. In turns of people listening to you, I'd recommend two options. The first would be to find the person in your family and friends that will tolerate listening to you the most, and see if ranting to them every once in a while is enough. If it isn't, then find someone new who will tolerate listening to you more, these people do exist. It's a crap answer I know, but let me explain. You're interested in increasing peoples interest in you when you speak. There is only one way to do this however and it is to talk about something they are interested in / care about. Obviously, they care about you, but do they care about you more than themselves? The romantic answer would be yes, but... in reality we know otherwise. After all, you are here complaining that people only want to talk about themselves and not you! You, my friend, are part of the problem too! :) As are we all. Perhaps therefore, people who care about you more will listen to you more, but I don't think think that is correct. I think that some people are simply more predisposed to listen than others. So find someone who will listen to you. There is nothing you can do about people who don't want to listen. While this answer is annoying, I hope I've convinced you that listening is a superpower and your family and friends being self obsessed is actually a blessing in disguise! Have fun improving your relationships with them all despite their flaws and good luck in finding someone to listen. Perhaps have an understanding with a friend that they can call you whenever they like and rant so long as you can do the same. I've had an arrangement like this and it got me through some really tough times. I hope you find what you're looking for, All the best, \\-Ryan<EwwJason>: Wow. This is what I needed.

Romantically women have to ask for anything in minuscule effort and vulnerability compared to men. This is just a gross egregious lie. Lie because of how far off from the truth it is it cant be called an exaggeration. Career? Okay. I agree SOMETIMES. Wanna know a time it doesn\u2019t, and a lot? Getting a degree or skill to open your own practice. My Gyno mom and vet sis never fought with equality since the 60/70s. Why? They removed the equality obstacles stat. Open your own practice! Friendships? Sorry that scale is dead even. Men and women deal with friendship issues the DEAD SAME. So let\u2019s tally folks! Dead same friendship. Barely any difference in career. MAJOR UNBALANCED POWER PLAYS in the dating world. Uhh, sorry honey but if you\u2019re gonna teach that shit to your daughter, expect some problems down the road. <axiuluo111>: Your gross generalization is also one of the biggest problems of inequality. Do you really believe that your mom and sister can literally just relax and chill now that they have their own practices?Work politics and sexist bullshit never ends just because you open your own practice. What about the times when you have to promote your own business? Ask for investment? Market yourself? Your mom and sister did better probably not because they opened up their own practice - btw that is a stupid over generalization, but because they work their ass off and they are competent in their skills. But just by harnessing that skills is not everything, you still need to go out their to get business and feed your peeps. Promoting your own business and getting clients in itself is ASKING FOR IT. Then let's also talk about people who actually don't work in private practice which I assume is most of us out there. When you need to advance in a career, especially as women, you need to ask for it instead of maintaining the mentality that it will come to you like what you think dating for women is. fewer women self promote at work than men. Just for a fact, women who are aggressive enough in their career will end up going a bit further. We are not talking about gender differences here, but we are talking about \"working for it/asking for it\" is definitely NOT a gender thing. Not sure your friendship comment - not sure what you are talking about. If you agree that women and men are the same, you essentially agree with what I said above. I will for sure continue teaching my daughters to work hard and ask for things that they want. If I don't teach that, they will probably end up like the sad male in an unbalanced play dating world like you mentioned and will have problems down the road. I'm sorry but what you are saying sounds really stupid. <tombstoning>: Everything you said was stupid. Didn\u2019t just sound it. You plagiarized my words and coin phrases and did your best to sound intelligent but your basis of premise was wrong to begin with. Wrong. They removed the obstacle. Are there not more women than men in the world??? Some if a women owned a private practice and women supported other women then there wouldn\u2019t be a problem money wise right??? Holy shit you don\u2019t think thugs thru. Now let\u2019s take this further into you gross exaggerations again as a woman : promoting your Biz is asking for it?? WAY TO DEMONIZE THE WHOLE MALE GENDER!!! Way to give your fellow humans some benefit of the doubt!! You\u2019re a saint! Last paragraph : way to lie honey. You know you lied and that\u2019s why I called you liars in my first reply. You know that\u2019s not what I said and the context too. Spin doctor master manipulator is another common tactic of women. You\u2019ve had to, admittedly, get your power from the word game over the past thousand years. One defense tactic is to tweak, twist, lie and pur\u00e9e a mans statement to fit your discrediting agenda. I\u2019m 45, been around the world a few times and dated women of all Color and cultures. Ain\u2019t foolin guys like me and most of the younger ones you do fool will only grow to realize it and then fault you. You\u2019re messing up your bed when it was already messy <axiuluo111>: Yeah dude. You sound really hostile and angry towards women. By stating your age and your own experiences don't give you any credits in this topic you know. In fact, it makes you look really sad...Your traveling around the world and dating different colors and cultures of women must have done you well. Do you know when you promote your own business, you need to go out there and get your name heard by people? Do you know how to do that? You make phone calls, you go to events, you network and you advertise. These are called asking for it. Not asking for it, meaning you sit your ass on your chair and just wait for opportunities to happen to you. Your comment is so stupid that you didn't even understand the fundamentals of business. And again, all i'm saying is that as women, we also have to face certain obstacles men also face. By no means I am DEMONIZING THE WHOLE MALE GENDER. Actually, that is what you are doing..you are demonizing the whole female gender. When you call me gross exaggerations as a woman, why don't we look at what you have saying: \"Spin doctor master manipulator is another common tactic of women. You\u2019ve had to, admittedly, get your power from the word game over the past thousand years. One defense tactic is to tweak, twist, lie and pur\u00e9e a mans statement to fit your discrediting agenda.\" Who is over generalizing and labeling now? You already have your \"world view\" against women written all over your statements. And you are wrong too. Even it's business for women and women supporting women, you still need to go out there to get business. It's still working hard and proactively getting the things you want. Do you really think that just by being a woman, things just come in our hands like nothing? I think you need to look deep down in your own views and understand what it is that makes you so angry towards women when your mom and sis worked so hard to support themselves and hopefully they are strong female examples in your life and you learned nothing from them about a single definition of \"hard work\"? <tombstoning>: 1. You said I didn\u2019t understand the fundamentals of business like it was a one time event. I\u2019m a loan officer, airline employee, own 2 homes, super host status on Airbnb, 200+positive rating on eBay. Wrote over ten mil in loans. Have a 820+ FICO score. Only debt is mortgage, 100k savings... yep I know nothing about Biz little gurl. Did you not make a hypothetical about the dangers women have from men blatantly with no proof, just a abstract generalization?? Yeah that\u2019s why I did that back to you. Chronological order, ever hear of it? Lastly, idiot moron pea-brain, where did I saw women\u2019s clients walk to them?? You know what I said and you MANIPULATED THAT just like I called it. I said specifically IF IF IF IF IF IF women supported each other then off the simple basis of larger population you\u2019d have more biz than men! But you\u2019re a liar and spin doctor and unabashedly arrogant about it too <axiuluo111>: Aww so sad you know so much but still can't form a grammatically correct sentence. I really didn't understand your words with so many repetitive words, all caps and grammar. Do you need a pair of magnifying glasses grandpa? A busy and successful person like you shouldn't be lurking on the internet all day. Please go out and actually contribute something positive to the society you keyboard warrior. Have a nice day!<tombstoning>: Aww so sad all you got is grammar and selling defense? Mommy and daddy couldn't pay for your schooling? &amp;#x200B; No evidence, proof or substance to contribute little child? Are you threatened by my PROWESS? &amp;#x200B; So you admit youre a loser in your parents basement with no money and frustrated your not farther along in your life? &amp;#x200B; Aww soooo sad!!! Cheers mate! Im a 20yr airline employee, been around the world3 times working on the 4th. I do plenty and see more countries in a month than you have in your whole life! Ill report back when I land and have internet again you mind reader. Sorry Im flying to Cabo today and not working. Sorry you guessed wrong again ;) lol &amp;#x200B; Children trying to play adult games, haha<axiuluo111>: Hahaha hey dude, your lies are exposed by yourself. You mentioned before that you are 45 and now you are 20?? Who's lying!? Hey kid, get off the internet. Your mommy and sissy are watching! They will be so disappointed to see you so naughty like this :p<tombstoning>: Wow get that reading comprehension and schizophrenia checked buddy! &amp;#x200B; How you get 20yr old from being a 20yr airline employee is beyond rationale. Serious illness my friend &amp;#x200B; Back away from the keyboard champ. I wish you the best in your recovery!! &amp;#x200B; <axiuluo111>: Make sure you get all the help you need buddy. Life is rough for you I get it. Especially hard in your world when all women trying to steal stuff from you right? I'm so sorry for you and sorry for your mom and sis who have a loser like you in the family :) Love much!<tombstoning>: Wow the illness is real. Gross exaggerations and lying just like I already stated. Proof in the print sweetie. Thanks &amp;#x200B; But seriously. Get help. Youre obviously a pathological liar and you know it. You dont fool regular people. You know youre a SPIN DOCTOR and lied i said 20yrs old. &amp;#x200B; Is that fun for you? Lying incoherently in attempts to make yourself look intelligent or gain advantage in discourse? &amp;#x200B; Yep, if youre a fair representative of your generation then youre all fucked. Thats whats sad honey. Cheers<axiuluo111>: You know that you are not contributing any valid points to a conversation except insult right? That is so sad and lonely though. You know when you fly to Cabo today can you make sure to get your symptoms checked? Health care is probably cheaper there and you probably need it. Women must have done something traumatizing to you when you grew up so that you hate them so much huh. Well that's sad that you let them get to you. Please get well soon. As a 45 yo man to have so much time typing away at work, you must feel so useless and unworthy at work. Aww I'm so sorry to hear. Is that because your job is being taken away by women and you internalize that hate? <tombstoning>: You still lying about lying little girl? Imitation is the highest form of flattery remember... &amp;#x200B; I already called YOU out for not contributing anything sweetie. I have a memory honey even at 45. EVERYONE read back and see where she's just copy and pasting me now. Its flattering but also signs of metal illness. &amp;#x200B; Honey. For reals. Get a grip. Youre a pathological liar and youre not even ashamed your own replies are here to see that proof &amp;#x200B; The illness is real with this one folks &amp;#x200B; Edited to highlight my FREE FLIGHTS from my airline job thats so sad for me, :) lol Wow this one is quick isn't she?? Couldn't even put 1+1 together equals FREE FLIGHTS SWEETIE !!! haha &amp;#x200B; EDITED AGAIN : EVERYONE !!! URGENT !!! Look at this girls profile, she's a mental health therapist or worker and she's clowning peoples mental health!?!?! &amp;#x200B; Honey you better delete this profile in a quickness. Hate to see you lose your job for picking on the people your supposed to be helping! Ill take some screen shots to save for a rainy day okay! Ill pass this on the to NALM chapter you just signed up to or whatever. Im sure they'll be super pleased to hear this!<axiuluo111>: You know you are answering your own questions right loser? No one ever asked you if you have a free flight or not. You just wanted to show off your free ticket to everyone? Is that because no one really takes your seriously in real life? Who the fuck cares about your free ticket buddy? You know what, I am not a mental health therapist, but I can tell already you are deeply in trouble. Well I guess if you talk with your penis, you probably only have dick to say right? Something must have happened to you when you were young and that's why you turned out to be so messed up. I'm so sorry for you. Take care internet stranger, I wish you the best in life. May all your hatred towards women goes away one day and you will see the world is a lovely place and you never need to use all caps or so much punctuation maniacally to sound loud or obnoxious. It's all in the heart too. You keep calling me honey sweetie, that's very nice of you to do that old man. You know what I don't really take that as insult. Have a safe flight to Cabo and stay warm :) Btw, I'm also saving your screenshots too, not for revenge, but it just makes me laugh. I'm saving it to cheer me up whenever I have a bad day. Much love &lt;3<tombstoning>: Pathological liar lying again... I never said anyone asked me but you did TRY to clown me about being some loser with no life, yet im at the gate waiting to board right now. Know who cares about my free flights? EVERYONE WANTS MY BUDDY PASSES LOSER. Do you even have a Passport? I have girls offering services and best friends and millionaire all vying to buy them of me. but ya know what? I dont care about money or solicited pussy. I care about where im going and who would be the best travel partner for that place or event. Or who deserves it. &amp;#x200B; Who taught you that cute line about dicks, youre Mom? She sounds classy too. What is the NALM then if youre not in the mental health field LIAR? &amp;#x200B; Seriously ill. You're a pathological liar and you still haven't retreated on the 20yr old issue. You just bounce around like the airhead you are. You cant stay on topic and are actually bad at lying for practicing so much. &amp;#x200B; No Love. Youre trash. Youre already of age and still defiant and dont even care. Actually youre a sociopath. Look into it. <axiuluo111>: Lol \ud83d\ude06 <tombstoning>: What a sociopath would reply...

They have a lot to pull from<RhinoMan2112>: Do you mean certain concepts are recycled like \"yes, and..\" or whatever, or literal jokes/scenes/etc? I listen to a good variety of improv podcasts and there are maybe broad concepts that are recycled, and perhaps certain inprovisers use their own styles over again, but i can't say I've noticed recycling to the point where it's no longer unique or funny. <salikabbasi>: link me :D<RhinoMan2112>: You mean specific podcasts? My personal favorite is Spontaneation with Paul f Tompkins. He's a master improviser and always has on a host of funny people to improv with. Show has a great format too.
