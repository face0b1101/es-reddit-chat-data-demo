Also like pi.<EyedLoki4292>: I mean there are two genders biologically. It\u2019s like give an inch and they take a foot kind of scenario. <Bheda>: Trigger Warning ahead. You've been warned! I'm an avid watcher of Ben Shapiro. He's very factual in the way he works and approaches political issues. One of his debates goes in to mental health being linked to the LGBTQ community. How they have the highest rate of suicide both before and after their gender reassignment. The rate of suicide does not change from before to after. His take on the subject is one we all need to start pushing passed the PC culture. What we're doing is feeding into delusions and acting as if it's normal. It isn't. We do not take any other delusional mental patient and play into their delusions to make them feel better. We get them help. The more we let these mental health issues and delusions strong arm their way into society, the more fucked we'll be. These people need real help. Not genital mutilation. If I go through my Facebook and pick out all these radical LGBTQ people, they all also post about their mental health issues. They're all on some sort of medication.<RonBach1102>: The only group with a similar suicide rate is paranoid schizophrenics. Just let that sink in. <Bheda>: It's 100% a mental illness. The numbers don't lie. It's just that the numbers don't play into their delusions. These confrontational, angry people, could have the opportunity to live such happy lives if they accept it for what it is and get real help.<WinterShadow476>: Gender dysphoria *is* a recognized mental disorder, and transitioning is currently the only viable treatment. Is it theoretically possible to just make them stop feeling that way? Yes, but it\u2019s human nature to take the path of least resistance, and the physical body is a hell of a lot easier to manipulate than the mind.<Bheda>: The issue with this path is, I don't think it solves the issues that lead to the dysphoria. Genital mutilation currently, if being used as a treatment, is nothing more than a poor band-aid.<WinterShadow476>: If it makes them comfortable in their own body and literally does not affect you in any way, I say live and let live.<Bheda>: But it does effect us.

What exactly do you lose by being nice? People have no problem referring to Gordon Sumner as Sting, but not resorting to the most petty thing possible is too much for you?<Bheda>: Because I'd have to ask someones name to know it. It isn't visual. I'm not going to go around and start meeting people like; Hello, my name is Bheda. I identify as a Straight Male. What is your name and preferred pronoun?

My parents were super fundy religious types. They put me in a private Christian school all the way through 10th grade. Their reasoning being that 1) there was no prayer there, 2) they taught evolution there, and 3) everyone there was very dangerous and at best, would ridicule me for my faith, but more \u201crealistically,\u201d upon discovering my family was Christian, would stab me with the knives that every single one of them had hidden in their lockers. I seriously believed that ALL public school children were *looking* for me, just so they could make fun of me as they killed me. So I was terrified of *everyone.* For years. I would only speak to adults. People my age left me frozen in fear. It really fucked me up in the head to the point of developing severe agoraphobia. But I moved in with my grandparents when I was 16. They were wonderful people. I got a full time job and finally was forced to interact with people outside of church and school. And you know what? They were all fantastic. Everyone I met. They just wanted to hang out and joke around and have a good time. They included me in shit, and it really changed my life for the better. Those were some really decent people that I\u2019ll never forget. Over time, I went from being too afraid to talk to anyone, or even pump gas (except at one very specific pump that I used exclusively for two years), to joining a band that performed live and even toured. After that, I even ended up fronting a different band, as the singer. And I loved it. I\u2019m 37 now. I\u2019m retired from the playing in the local music scene, but I\u2019ll still go out and watch others play. Nobody believes me when I tell them that in the past, before I was the sort to feel more fulfilled playing music on a stage than anywhere else, that to call me shy would be a gross understatement. So yeah, I was fooled. But thanks to all the people out there that I\u2019ve met, who are kind and friendly, and probably a lot like whoever you happen to be as you read this, I\u2019m not fooled anymore. So thanks, everyone. For being kind and decent and normal, and assuming that I was, too. That was cool of you.<1khmtd_Surge>: sometimes parents lie<ArmyOfDog>: Well I know that *now.* And I pump gas anywhere I damn well please. It\u2019s so liberating!<1khmtd_Surge>: do you harbor any non-respectful thoughts concerning the duplicities your parents dispensed?<ArmyOfDog>: When I was in my early 20s, I did. Not anymore. My step-father is long dead, and this all came from him. I found out after he died that my mom was only playing along because he withheld money for groceries from her if she was not 100% in line with his decrees. He\u2019d go out to eat, while she\u2019d scrape change together to buy Ramen for us, until she fell in line again when we ran out of food and spare change, at which point we had regular food again. She was forced to quit her job after they got married, and be a housewife. So the money he gave her every week is all she had to work with. When he\u2019d cut it off, there wasn\u2019t much she could do for long. I always thought it was weird at the time, but I never knew what was really happening until his death. At that point, she finally felt it was safe to tell me. Which she did in a very apologetic way. She was really in a no-win situation the entire time. I really admire that she silently endured that for me and my siblings for almost 20 years. She was often much like the boy next door\u2019s mom in American Beauty, sitting silently, apologizing with a vacant stare for the messy house that was in reality, immaculately kept. She\u2019s super chill now, and we\u2019re very close. She came back out of her shell when he died, and is totally happy and vibrant and loves life and has a good circle of friends who are all really positive and decent people. She\u2019s a wiser, smarter version of the happy and loving mom I remember from before my step-father came into the picture.<1khmtd_Surge>: yeah. Glad you made it. Welcome to the world! <edit>: add on ... I mean you've been here a while, but you got over a bit of a setback early on.<ArmyOfDog>: Glad to be here! Thank you, friend.

Together, we did it!<fuchajen>: proud of you, and so happy your mum is finally free too :)<ArmyOfDog>: And I\u2019m happy you\u2019re a kind and decent person who took the time to say so. I\u2019m not naive. Not that anyone said I am. I know there are assholes out there. Sometimes, that asshole is me, if life plays out that way with all the wrong things happening at once. But all the same, if we strive to make life good and happy, with the fortune bestowed upon us, as people who can take the time to get on Reddit and shoot the shit about things like this, life *will* be good and happy. I think of it like this - every time I\u2019m stuck in traffic, I used to be irritated.

Using tax funded services without paying taxes yourself is more akin to theft than taxation itself. You\u2019re more than welcome to never use any publicly funded services again, if you\u2019re so concerned about being \u201cstolen\u201d from. Good luck with that lack of education, transportation infrastructure, house fires, the list goes on and on. Your life would be shit without taxes. <redditoriousBIG>: Pointing out the inevitability of utilizing a monopolized service isn't a good counter argument. False dichotomy. <AyeMyHippie>: Bir Tawil sounds perfect for you. No government to \u201csteal\u201d taxes from you. I\u2019m sure you can build a comfortable life for yourself there. <redditoriousBIG>: Again, this is not a strong argument. \"America, Love it or Leave It\" is a False Dilemma fallacy. <AyeMyHippie>: Except that\u2019s not the argument at all. The argument is that if you don\u2019t like paying taxes, you\u2019re more than welcome to live somewhere without taxes and see how that works out for you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy the lack of basic infrastructure. Your argument of \u201ctaxes are theft\u201d without acknowledging that you use services funded by tax dollars every single day of your life is the biggest fallacy here. Seriously, go somewhere without taxes and see how awesome your life is without clean water, paved roads and emergency services. It\u2019ll be loads of fun.<redditoriousBIG>: If you don't like X, you can Y is the argument. It's a false dilemma in that these are not the exclusive options. This is a basic logical fallacy.<AyeMyHippie>: So tell me, what is the alternative to living somewhere that collects taxes, if you don\u2019t want to pay taxes? <redditoriousBIG>: That's a great question and I'm glad you asked it! Any arrangement which is based on consent rather than threats of violence is valid. Another question by way of thought experiment is to think about the things government does which you don't want your taxes spent on. It's easy to point out basic infrastructure which \"no one could disagree is necessary\" I. E. roads, clean water, safe food, fire protection etc. Everyone wants a safe and productive society. You might challenge yourself to find solutions outside of the current paradigm. Many societies managed to have those things long before taxation which is a relatively new invention. Roads certainly pre-date it. \"The Enterprise of Law: Justice Without the State\" by Bruce Benson is a great primer for non-monopoly or polycentric legal systems. \"The Machinery of Freedom\" by David Friedman is about how consent based governance is not only possible but has worked in various human cultures in the past. <AyeMyHippie>: Holy shit. You think that water treatment, advanced medical care, and paved roads predate taxation? I can\u2019t argue with you, because we\u2019re apparently living in two different worlds. Let me know when you want to discuss the way things are on earth, and we can talk. I have no interest in discussing the history and policies of a world that doesn\u2019t exist. <redditoriousBIG>: You asked for suggestions for solutions and I've offered them. User fee based models exist for everything you just suggested. Again, simply stating the ways that existing government monopolized services is not an argument against any alternative. <AyeMyHippie>: Have you ever been on a toll road? Imagine having to pay a toll for every single road you drive on. That\u2019s not what you want, I promise. I guarantee that alone would eat up more of your income than the taxes you pay. Anyway, I\u2019m done with this ridiculous conversation. Go ahead and stop paying taxes if you\u2019re that upset over them. I\u2019ll be glad to fund the jail you end up in with my tax dollars. <redditoriousBIG>: Imagine not threatening others with violence and being locked in a cage! There's a long history of tax protestors. I'm sure it was hard for most people in 1860 to imagine a world without slavery, in 1950 a world without segregation just as it's difficult for you to imagine a world not predicated on violence. At least you're honest about your bloodlust. <AyeMyHippie>: No, I just think thieves belong in jail, where they can\u2019t steal from people that actually work and pay for the things they have/use. Follow the rules, pay your taxes, or find some place that is more in line with your beliefs. If you can\u2019t find said place, maybe that\u2019s an indication that your beliefs are stupid. <redditoriousBIG>: Excellent then we agree that government officials belong in prison for theft and extortion..", "num_messages": 16, "avg_score": 752.375}

Basically aliens have a star trek style \"Prime Directive\" not to interact with us until we interact with them.<MartinaS90>: According to Isaac Arthur, it's not. The main problem is that if there are any technically advanced civilization, we should **see** them. You can't hide a big galactic civilization, unless you break the laws of thermodynamics. Heat is radiated as infrared light everywhere. Let's say someone constructed a something big to use the energy of a star. That structure irradiates infrared light in a way that should be very visible from our position and current technology. Sure you can't \"trap\" that radiation, but only for a limited amount of time as temperature would start increasing, at some point you have to let it go which equals to fire a lighthouse of stellar proportions. <Edit>: Anyone that wants to see what Isaac Arthur says about it can check his series of videos about it: [The Fermi Paradox &amp; the Dyson Dilemma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4) [Fermi Paradox Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4) [The Fermi Paradox Compendium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDPj5zI66LA) And many more, he even has videos in his channel dedicated exclusively to specific answers to the Fermi Paradox. Usually whatever answer you think to the Paradox (like \"the space is big\", or \"they could be using another type of energy\" or \"they are wiped out by thei AIs\") he discusses them in detail. Check his entire channel, it's one of the best in Youtube about this stuff (probably the best).<Wintermule42>: Also its very hard if not impossible to enforce such a directive. It only takes one person who ignores it to break.<MartinaS90>: This is the key point. Many people can come with a clever answer to how they could hide themselves, but that's irrelevant. Because it only takes **one** civilization to do it in a different way, or only one small group among a big civilization, or even one single individual. If anyone is going to give a Fermi Paradox answer, it has to be applieable to every single one of the hypothetical existing advanced technological civilizations, without exception.<ihaveadogname>: The most likely answer I have seen to the Fermi Paradox is that we are the first.<rafikiknowsdeway1>: The fermi paradox isnt even a paradox. Space is fucking huge, there could be advanced civilizations everywhere but it could be physically impossible for any of them to ever interact. Stuff like warp drives arent guaranteed to be possible in reality. They can easily be far enough away that the energy they give off cant be distinguished as having to come from living things<ihaveadogname>: I mean, honestly TIME is fucking huge too.

Their history explained that the tribes agreed to live under the protection of the warrior black panther. Don't forget all the \"great power .. great responsibility\" stuff that they are clearly implying too. Also, I would hardly consider what they are doing with their resources as them exploiting the vibranium. They've used it to build an amazingly technologically advanced culture which clearly the majority of their population benefits from. Have they used that technology to shield themselves from other countries? Yes, but clearly they felt the need to do so, and by the end of the movie they have said they would be sharing their technology. As for no evidence of sharing it, letting the Avengers come in and use their technology to create a new arm for Bucky and also to separate Vision from his stone would both qualify considering how much they were against such sharing before. Also, there was a post credits scene in black panther where they were in front of a world council and said \"we will share our technology and resources and not hide in the shadows\".

There are an infinitely amount of odd numbers, none of which are even.<pingu_for_president>: But the defining characteristic of an odd number is that it's not even. It's logically impossible for an odd number to be even. Is it a defining characteristic of a guy who wears a red costume and shoots sticky webs that he doesn't exist?<ninja_cracker>: infinite does not mean everything. I was trying to find an intuitive example of where something is infinite and does not contain everything. The infinite universe theory states that there is infinite amount, but doesn't state that all of them exist. The gummy bear universe where gummy bear versions of us having this conversion, in all likelihood, does not exist, for several reasons.<pingu_for_president>: True, but there are scientific reasons for that. Is there a scientific reason why no-one would be born with some kind of genetic mutation (I don't think the backstory has to be the same for them to be Spiderman) that would allow them to shoot spiderwebs?<critically_damped>: No, but that characteristic alone wouldn't qualify them for the title of *Spider-Man*. (respecting the hyphen) This is the same as people who argue for a historical Jesus Christ. Certainly there may have been 50 or 60 itinerant preachers named Yeshua or whatever, and maybe even all of them gave sermons on mounts about loving your neighbor and paying your taxes. But unless it an be shown that one of them had magical powers over life and death, the argument that *Jesus the Christ* actually existed is invalid.<KetamineKastle>: Jesus being a real figure is pretty much universally accepted by historians. Saying Jesus didn\u2019t exist is the equalivelent of a Christian saying \u201cevolution doesn\u2019t exist\u201d even when almost all scientist universally accept it.<critically_damped>: No, it isn't universal, and further your response blatantly ignores what I just said regarding what \"actually existed\" means. So I would like you to back away from the scripted non-sequiturs you have lined up and actually read what I wrote if you're going to respond. Those \"historians\" who \"universally accept\" that Jesus was a \"real figure\" *do not have any evidence of the miracles and other things that actually define the character of Jesus in the Bible.*<KetamineKastle>: The Jesus in the Bible existed and was crucified for his blasphemous claims by the Jews/Pontius Pilate. Regardless of if you believe he did miracles. Maybe he was a crazy guy with a delusional cult following who knows. Saying \u201c40-50\u201d implies you don\u2019t think that specific man existed.<critically_damped>: Saying a thing doesn't make it true. \"Historians\" saying a thing doesn't make it true. *Saying that Historians say a thing* Sure as **FUCK** doesn't make it true. And you keep completely dismissing the fact that without the fucking magical powers, the person you're talking about isn't **Jesus Christ**, exactly how a guy named Peter Parker who *doesn't* have spider powers isn't fucking **Spider-Man**.<KetamineKastle>: &gt; Saying a thing doesn't make it true. \"Historians\" saying a thing doesn't make it true. This is exactly why I compared it to creationism. It's borderline delusion against facts and evidence to support your beliefs. What would you say if you replaced historians with \"scientists\" to a Christian?<critically_damped>: I would say that you were replacing words without regards to meaning, context, or respect for language or ideas. I'd say you were engaging in a half-assed whataboutist word-swap game because you can't fucking stand to talk about the idea that there's no evidence that any person with magical powers has ever existed.<KetamineKastle>: Edgelord 3000 here. You literally said &gt;This is the same as people who argue for a historical Jesus Christ. Nobody argues Jesus as a messiah who did miracles as a historical fact. Even the most diehard Christian fundamentalist will say it comes down to faith. When people argue for a historical Jesus they argue for whether the man himself existed historically, not his powers.<critically_damped>: Even when you copy and paste parts of what I write you can't be bothered to read a single fucking word of it.

It\u2019s important to remember that in order for you to have rights, you have to stand up for the rights of others that you do not agree with. This is what worries me about google blocking anti-vax searches. I\u2019m all for the government legislating around vaccinations. But when you stop information everyone agrees to block it if it\u2019s for the greater good, but what happens when what people perceive as the greater good changes? I\u2019m very much worried about the blocking of information, because as soon as you can convince someone it\u2019s bad for them, you justify the stopping of information, whether it\u2019s actually bad or not. <Edit>: for clarity. Freedom of speech laws against violence or bomb making instructions should still apply. Further, laws mandating vaccines are supported by myself. I\u2019m raising concern about censorship by mob rule by companies and governments.<fuhrertrump>: im pretty sure there is a few groups that we don't agree with, and we don't defend. example: racists, anti vaxxers, nazi's etc... &amp;#x200B; or is there something we need to know about you?<Javerlin>: Under some governments, being gay is illegal. In those societies removal of information regarding homosexuality is the norm. Look at Russia. With growing divisiveness in the West we should be worried about what ideologies are in ascendance and if we want to set a precedent for removing information from public accessibility. Just humour the thought experiment, say nationalism grows in the West, and liberal ideas are thought of as dangerous, if there was a president for removing information then it would be done much sooner, make it easier for that information to be removed and harder for a liberal resurgence. In countries with free information democratic processes emerge. At no point did I ever say things like antivaxers should be defended. I clearly stated I support legislation against them. I\u2019m simply concerned about governments and cooperations deciding what information the public has access to. Look at the way social media and data collection influence our voting and politics. I\u2019m expressing concern, there\u2019s no need to accuse me of being a nazi apologist for wanting freedom of information.<fuhrertrump>: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox\\_of\\_tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) &amp;#x200B; come back after you had a read through this. <Javerlin>: I\u2019m not advocating tolerance without limit. As stated in both of my pervious posts. If you wanted to discuss something with me I\u2019d be more than glad to. But as you are not engaging with what I have to say I wonder what you are doing here.<fuhrertrump>: giving people a chance to educate themselves of their own free will before they find themselves on the wrong side of history. &amp;#x200B; i can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it realize giving nazi's a foot to stand on is bad.<Javerlin>: Again. I never advocated that. I specifically said that legislation against these issues is supported. Don\u2019t strawman any further. Information restrictions such as bomb making instructions etc should still apply. Freedom of speech laws against inciting violence still apply. I said we need to consider the president that we\u2019re setting before it is used against the liberal world that we enjoy.<fuhrertrump>: so then, i guess i should ask you, in your infinite wisdom. how many people do nazi's and similar white supremacists have to kill before we decide killing them first is in our best interests ? 100? 10000? 1000000? &amp;#x200B; do they have to kill as many minorities as the did in the 40s? what about half? or 10% ? &amp;#x200B; they got up to 14 million ish before we were able to finally stop them, is that how far you need it to go before you realized you fucked up just like the weimar republic did ? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; fail to learn from history, you are doomed to repeat it lol. &amp;#x200B; though let me know sooner rather than later how many people need to die so i can let them know lol. <Javerlin>: What... oh wait: u/fuhrertrump Well that explains things.<fuhrertrump>: \\&gt;TFW you think the guy that is against nazi's is a nazi because he created an ironic username &amp;#x200B; i suppose you have a difficult time with buffalo wings too huh? lol <Javerlin>: Nope, I just think you're a troll<fuhrertrump>: cool story sweetie.", "num_messages": 13, "avg_score": 8.1538461538}

I don't get what being durch has anything to do with it. I also forgot to bring up the whole citroen and limoen. ALSO saying beer and beir outloud sounds so close to me. I have had this convo with a lot of dutch people and I get the same response, they don't get why I find it confusing. It just sounds similar. Speaking of beer, I find it also amusing you call your neighbor buurman which sounds like beer man to me. I was introduced to a neighbor and my dutch isn't that great (big shock) and I thought oh this guy works at the beer store. ANOTHER funny story I was working for some people in Holland and one of the employees that didn't speak English came up to me asking for a scheck or thats what it sounded like. I told him I don't get paid until Saturday then one of the guys that did speak English told me he was asking for a rolled cigarette.<SRidwtd04>: Than say that now it felt like you said I was wrong or sth because no I wasn't referring to the colour why would you thing that if I'm talking fruit and sinaasappel..?

I prefer saying Holland, I never understood why they call it THE Netherlands as apposed to just Netherlands. Why not Nederlands even. Why is Duetschland, Germany? Munchen - Munich. When I commented on the color I believe that was in response to someone's comment. And Feyenoord is of course the greatest club of all time.<SRidwtd04>: The Netherlands is called Nederland in Dutch. I know why it's multiple though. A long time ago the Netherlands used to be called: de 7 Verenigde Nederlanden (the 7 United Netherlands). Now in Dutch people were too lazy to say de Nederlanden and Nederland Just sounds better and unique, as one, but the English people didn't really care about that I guess and called in the Netherlands.

Or 1+1=10? Also, you aren't proving anything mathematically impossible. You're proving that decimal \"one\" + decimal \"one\" = binary \"one-zero\", which is perfectly mathematically sound.<Ducttapemummy>: Not binary, base 4. Binary is base 2, so you count: 0,1,10,11,100 Base 4 would be counted:0,1,2,3,10,11,12,13,20... So 2 +2 in base 4 actually makes 10<BobbitTheDog>: Fair enough, but then I'm not sure how programming is relevant... No systems use a quarternary system that I can think of... Also still nothing impossible proved, if I was that teacher I'd a smacked those kids down fast... But tell them it was a good attempt.<Ducttapemummy>: I believe the thought behind his post is, same as me, through programming you get to know and understand other counting systems. We never learned this in school. We just came in touch with it through the interest in programming oder similar things. So the others simply had no idea of how binary, hexadecimal or any base x system works. I don't know why they chose base 4 to prove their point, but that honestly is not our business. Yes, you're right. They don't prove anything impossible, but if they for example asked their teacher: \"If we can prove you that 2+2=10, can we skip the finals?\", it would be the teachers fault, which it is either way, because the skipped it.

[removed]<clocksailor>: Yeah. Women are expected to keep their families fed in exchange for no money/fame/appreciation. Men get to do the creative, prestigious, career version.<Cuddlyzombie91>: Not all women, especially today. I don't expect to be cooked anything by my SO. Women can be chef's if they want to, and I'm sure there are exceptional women in the profession. It's 2019 not 1940.<clocksailor>: Of course there\u2019s no law preventing women from being chefs. That\u2019s not the point. Women *can* be in the Senate, but they\u2019re still incredibly outnumbered.<Cuddlyzombie91>: The Senate is an entirely different issue, let's stick to the topic. You can't compare making a meal at home for 3-5 people to cooking for 100's of people in a restaurant. Not any man can do that and even then there are some women that can. This shit has nothing to do with sex, it's about talent and commitment.<clocksailor>: So the disparity between the number of male chefs/politicians/CEOS/billionaires and female ones are all total 100% coincidences? Fascinating<Hexadecimated>: I bet you\u2019re just fine with the amount of female garbage workers, janitors, and construction workers, though.<clocksailor>: Sure. Those are all perfectly good jobs that pay well, but there's not as much competition to get into them, and they don't hold outsize power over the way the country is run in the way that very wealthy and famous people do. Why do you ask? Seems like you're implying that people should feel shame about holding those jobs. Why is that? What do you do for a living?<Zack_all_Trades>: He's asking you why you think overrepresentation of males in the culinary arts is an issue but a non issue when the same logic is applied to labor-based careers.<clocksailor>: &gt; they don't hold outsize power over the way the country is run in the way that very wealthy and famous people do.<MelisandreStokes>: Just because there are a few wealthy and famous chefs doesn\u2019t make them powerful people. The answer is that it *is* an issue that women are underrepresented in the trades, which is why there are so many orgs dedicated to attracting women to the trades<clocksailor>: &gt; it is an issue that women are underrepresented in the trades Can you tell me why you feel that way?<MelisandreStokes>: Briefly: Because they pay better than the jobs women normally get with the same level of qualifications. Also I think it\u2019s important for women to be in all fields, especially useful ones like the trades. Can you tell me why you *don\u2019t* feel that way?<clocksailor>: &gt; Can you tell me why you don\u2019t feel that way? I didn't say I don't, I just wanted to find out where you were coming from before putting my two cents in. Yeah, I also think women should be in trades for the same reasons as you, and even also some additional ones. But like, Republican men in Texas are trying to make it so that women can be put to death for getting an abortion. Ohio just restricted their abortion access, like, two days ago. Women are under serious life-changing legislative attack, right now, today. I don't think the men on this thread who are making the argument that the dearth of women plumbers is as big of a deal as the dearth of women lawmakers (and women rich people with the clout to influence those lawmakers) are doing so in good faith.<MelisandreStokes>: No, of course not. That\u2019s why I like to point out that the reason they\u2019ve never heard of all the orgs focused on getting women into the trades is because they never looked for them, because they don\u2019t actually care.<clocksailor>: Haha, yeah. I got into a beef about this yesterday where some guy was saying that the men's rights activism movement is exactly the same as the feminist movement: mostly decent people with some fringe folks making a lot of noise. I'd be okay with that argument if I saw MRAs organizing, starting foundations, fundraising, lobbying, passing laws, donating money, or doing really anything to win gains for men instead of just complaining about women. Whatever you think of feminists in general, you can't deny that they got women the vote and have forced countless other legislative wins for women all over the world.
