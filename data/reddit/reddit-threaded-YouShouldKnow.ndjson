And if that fetus is a woman? And I respect its choice to grow up into a person? I understand you will never agree because we are arguing under different premises. I aknowledge your view point as valid under the premise that the fetus is not life. Do you not see how you would come to the opposite conclusion if your premise were different? I don't hate women man lol<throwaway4myfeelss>: You respect the tiny piece of tissue more than the grown woman who now has to host it... ....so what you *think the fetus might want* is more important than what a grown woman wants, even though she is able to voice her thoughts to your face and the tissue mass cant? tissues can\u2019t form thoughts, feelings, or have aspirations.... the woman who\u2019s forced to host the tissue however, does have thoughts feelings and aspirations but fuck her right? <Eredea>: I'm done having this conversation with you. And you can telepathically communicate with the newborn, right? If it's life, yes. I absolutely care more about that person's ability to live than I care about a person's ability to live comfortably. I would hope that is understandable. No. Not fuck her. I think we should do more to take care of women who are born with children they are incapable of taking care of. But since I believe that fetus is a human life, no I don't think that she should just be allowed to 'terminate' it, even if it would make her life 1,000,000 easier. It's an unfortunate situation all around, no doubt. I would never make a woman feel wrong for getting an abortion, anyone who does is not being true to the religious ideals they portray. Once again, we're working on different premises. Everything you say makes since given off the facts your starting with. But, if you start with the fact that it's a child, can we kill it because of this woman's \"thoughts, feelings and aspirations\"? Of course not. Ironically your point on the flubber (and how you answered the question you asked me) is the exact point we disagree on. Would you kill the newborn for this woman's thoughts feelings and aspirations? Now, if you believe they are effectively the same, and realize that given nothing but time this \"flubber\" would turn into this newborn, you would of course not kill either. Good bye. I am open to having a conversation in good faith but you're being ridiculous.<secretlives>: So do you think we should force people to donate organs if they would save a life? <Eredea>: No. Not necessarily.<secretlives>: That's weird, I thought you cared more about a person's ability to live than you cared about another person's ability to live comfortably.<Eredea>: Oh, you got me. I realize now how much I hate women. Nice man.<secretlives>: So I guess that offer of conversation in good faith isn't applicable after you've been shown your own hypocrisy.<Eredea>: You really think this is in good faith? You're joking. And no, no hypocrisy. Even in the slightest. You can't force someone to give up there organs. You can PREVENT someone from taking another life (if you see it as such). That's the distinction. One is protecting the rights of the child. The other is violating someone's rights not to have their organs stolen. I mean the distinction is obvious. Besides, I said not necessarily. Frankly yes everyone SHOULD, but you can't force them to do something like that.<secretlives>: Got it - you can force someone to do something with their body that they don't want to, because it's saving a life. But you _can't_ force someone to do something with their body that they don't want to just because it would save a life. Wait...<Eredea>: Its not her own body. That's the point. I put the fetus on the exact same level as the newborn. Would you kill the newborn to make your life easier? I'm assuming your answer is no. I view it in the exact same way. Now, if you want to say that based off of the fact that you wouldn't kill the newborn, you should force organ transplants, maybe we can have that discussion. But it is wholly separate than that of abortion. <secretlives>: It's okay to force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term because not doing so would result in a person dying. It's not okay to force anyone to donate an organ because not doing so would result in a person dying. <Eredea>: You're not listening. I know you're not going to. Is it okay to \"force a mother to care for her newborn\"? It's the same thing if you start with the premise that the fetus is life. You're being intentionally obtuse. I can admit that your side makes sense if I start with a different set of facts. You're incapable of doing the same. The analog you're actually looking for is more similar to killing off someone with good organs, to give them to someone else so that they may not have to go to dialysis. And no, I don't think that would be right either. Do you maybe see how that is a bit more similar? Forcing her to carry it to term? No. I'm preventing her from killing what I see to be life. I'm not forcing her to do anything at all besides not terminating what I believe to be life. There is no action required. Contrast this to forcibly stealing someone's organs.<secretlives>: &gt;Forcing her to carry it to term? No. I'm preventing her from killing what I see to be life. I'm not forcing her to do anything at all besides not terminating what I believe to be life. There is no action required. Contrast this to forcibly stealing someone's organs. You are forcing her to give birth - you are forcing her to remain in a state which she does not want to be in. That is violating her bodily autonomy. <Eredea>: Yeah. I'm very sorry for that for her. Unfortunately, I don't think she can go killing off the child because she doesn't want it. <secretlives>: &gt; It's okay to force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term because not doing so would result in a person dying. &gt; &gt; It's not okay to force anyone to donate an organ because not doing so would result in a person dying. <Eredea>: I told you, that's an entirely separate conversation we can have, if you wish. However: The analog you're actually looking for is more similar to killing off someone with good organs, to give them to someone else so that they may not have to go to dialysis. And no, I don't think that would be right either. Do you maybe see how that is a bit more similar? To me, it's blatantly clear how my scenario is more similar to an abortion than is yours. Abortion (and this scenario) involve the active choice to terminate a life in order to ease the life of another. We can have a philosophical \"trolley problem\" regarding inaction and how it may lead to more deaths. But it's not as closely parallel as the scenario of making the choice to kill one.<secretlives>: No - it's not. You're forcing someone to do something with their body that they do not want to do. Something that involves a degree of risk of injury or death. Your justification for forcing them to do this is that by not doing it, someone will die. If you believe that life is sacred and should come before the bodily autonomy of an individual - then you should support the idea of forcing someone to donate an organ to save a life. I'm not arguing with you on whether or not a fetus is equal to a newborn, we will always disagree on that and that's fine. But even if it were a newborn, forcing the mother to give up her bodily autonomy to save a newborn is not okay. The same as forcing anyone to give up their bodily autonomy to save another is not okay. You and you alone get to choose what you do with your body, above all else. Giving birth is an excruciatingly painful process for all women and a potentially dangerous one for some. Forcing them to do that against their will because otherwise a child would die is a violation of her bodily autonomy. The question is simple - do you support violating the bodily autonomy of an individual so another can live?<Eredea>: \"You and you alone get to choose what you do with your body, above all else. \". I agree. And as I've stated many times, I see the fetus as a child. As a body. The woman can't decide what to do with the child's body. It cannot speak up for itself yet. I would not kill it. Good bye. This is clearly fruitless. Have a good one. <secretlives>: But she can decide what to do with hers. And if that means not giving birth, so be it. Maybe the fetus can walk it off after it gets taken out. <Eredea>: \" But even if it were a newborn, forcing the mother to give up her bodily autonomy to save a newborn is not okay. \" This is insane. Totally insane.<secretlives>: Just as insane as saying \"forcing an individual to give up their bodily autonomy to save another person is not okay\", which you have no problem doing in regards to organ transplants.<Eredea>: Nah fam. You're not even listening. I began with \"not necessarily\" and continued with \"it's a separate issue we can discuss\". My alternative analogy with organ donation is so obviously more close to the situation you're describing. There's a difference between inaction. Can you kill someone to harvest their organs so that another may live a life without dialysis? Can you kill someone to prevent taking a pregnancy to term to save a little pain and inconvenience? Or whatever the reasoning may be? You're taking away the \"bodily autonomy\" (which is evidently much more important than life itself) of THE CHILD. But you literally said even if it was a child and alive, it's still okay to kill. I can't relate there bud. I am personally glad that I wasn't aborted, and despite the annoyance you're causing me now, I'm glad you weren't killed as a fetus either. Good luck bud<secretlives>: &gt; My alternative analogy with organ donation is so obviously more close to the situation you're describing. There's a difference between inaction. No - it isn't. You're forcing an individual to undergo a procedure which they do not want to undergo because not doing so will result in someone dying. If you don't donate a kidney, someone dies. It's an exact analogy. You just don't like it because it highlights the illogical base you're standing on. I'll ask the question again - do you support violating the bodily autonomy of an individual so another can live? Should `an individual` be forced to undergo `an invasive procedure or surgery` because not doing so will result in `another person` dying? You don't get to change your answer just because one time it's a woman being forced to give birth and the next time is a man being forced to give up a kidney.<Eredea>: Yes it is. Look, I understand where you're coming from and why you think the way you do. I don't see why it is so hard for you to see it my way. I don't like it because nowhere does it involve actively killing someone. Which the other scenario does. That's a pretty big difference to me. If you don't see it as such, okay.<secretlives>: &gt; Should `an individual` be forced to undergo `an invasive procedure or surgery` because not doing so will result in `another person` dying? &gt; &gt; You don't get to change your answer just because one time it's a woman being forced to give birth and the next time is a man being forced to give up a kidney. <Eredea>: Should \"a life be taken\" to \"ease the suffering\" of another? <secretlives>: Should someone die because someone doesn't want to be uncomfortable during/after surgery removing their kidney?<Eredea>: Hey man. Your opinion is valid and I understand it. I would hope you can consider mine and come to the same thing<secretlives>: I understand your opinion on things which there can be differences of opinion on. For example - I disagree that a fetus is a life, but I understand that you do and there will always be a difference of opinion on that so I don't address it. I speak and phrase all of my questions from your perspective - one in which the fetus is equal to a child. You at no point have considered anything other than your own opinion. When faced with a logical inconsistency in your own reasoning you ran away from it, simply refusing to answer a question I've posed now 3 separate times. &gt; Should `an individual` be forced to undergo `an invasive procedure or surgery` because not doing so will result in `another person` dying?<Eredea>: I think it's very straightforward to go from \"fetus is life\" to \"don't kill it\". We can go in circles all day. But that's pretty much my whole argument, and it seems to flow obviously and easily from the premise.<secretlives>: Last time - simple question you won't answer: &gt; Should `an individual` be forced to undergo `an invasive procedure or surgery` because not doing so will result in `another person` dying? <Eredea>: I told you already I understand where you're coming from. You're a sad, pitiful person. You realize I asked you a similarly pointed question you refuse to answer? Should an individual be forced to die because not doing so will result in bad circumstances for another?<secretlives>: &gt; Should an individual be forced to die because not doing so will result in bad circumstances for another? If the \"bad circumstances\" involve violating their bodily autonomy by forcing them to under a procedure or surgery then yes. I don't think anyone should be forced to go through the bad circumstances (having a kidney removed) to allow another person to live. Similarly, I don't think anyone should be forced to go through the bad circumstances (giving birth/carrying a pregnancy to term) to allow another person to live. Now explain to me why you agree with one of those statements and disagree with the other.<Eredea>: I just don't think you can kill of an unborn fetus because you don't want to give birth to it. I don't think you can forcibly cut someone open and steal there organs either. It's not difficult to understand, and you're being intentionally obtuse. If preserving \"bodily autonomy\" is more valuable to you than preserving life itself, this will never come to an end. I just cannot relate. I have told you the organ thing is a separate issue. I literally said not necessarily. Maybe they should have their organs removed, what the hell do I know? I just know that you can't kill anything that inconveniences you, lol. I'm sorry you feel differently. It seems from the difference of death by inaction vs death by direct action. I don't see it as \"forcing the woman to have a baby\". I view it as protecting the child's right to live. Once again, your analogy is just not the same. The most accurate analogy stems from killing a healthy person so that a sick (and not dying) person can live a more convenient life.", "num_messages": 35, "avg_score": 0.7428571429}

Saturday's deadline applies to: AL, AK, AZ, AR, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MI, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY. These states have later deadlines: CA, CO, MA, MN, NY, RI, DC. Healthcare in this country is insanely expensive but you may qualify for government subsidies that cover some or all of the cost of the insurance and then you'll actually be able to go to the doctor if you get sick or have an accident. If you make less than $20k a year there's a good chance you can get a plan that costs $0-$20 a month and covers a lot. Go to [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) to see if you qualify before midnight Saturday. You can also call them at (800) 318-2596 but wait times are getting long. If you talk to a broker or go elsewhere online, watch out for scams like: short-term insurance (doesn't cover prescriptions or pre-existing, banned by some states) healthcare sharing ministries (unregulated, lots of loopholes, not actually legally required to cover anything) critical illness (nicknamed \"cash cancer\" for a reason - but only obscure cancers you'll never get) hospital indemnity (cash when you go to the hospital, this is NOT health insurance) etc. <CrazybutSolid>: Frenchman here: does this mean you just can't get insurance at any moment? If you miss the deadline there's nothing you can do to get health insurance next year in those states???<Ikantbeliveit>: American here. Yep, and the deadline was shortened by the current presidential administration so he could effectively kill it. Y\u2019all got some yellow jackets we can borrow? <LovableContrarian>: Well, yes and no. There is an open-enrollment period and a deadline to buy insurance through the government-run \"marketplace.\" But, you can just call up an insurance company and buy insurance whenever you want, anytime of year. And since Trump gutted the marketplace, there is no real benefit to purchasing on the marketplace (unless you are low income and qualify for tax credits). I am self-employed, and the best plan offered to me was $500/mo for a crappy plan with an $12,000 deductible. I make too much to qualify for any helpful assistance, but I don't make enough to buy one of these plans. I can't swing $500/mo and still be able to pay for rent/bills/food/etc, especially when that $500/mo really only buys my catastrophe insurance (and won't help me pay for doctors, medication, etc). Looks like I'll be uninsured next year. Which isn't shocking, as I've been uninsured for about 7 of the past 10 years. I'm a college grad, making respectable money (though not rich), and I if I get in a car accident next year, I'll be in debt for the rest of my life. Gotta love America.<Butt_fairies>: This is my situation, too. I don't make a crazy amount, but I don't make great money, either. I only got \"qualified\" to get decently priced insurance a couple years ago because I had a part time job at 16hours/week, minimum wage. It's retarded. I can't get my inhaler to breathe every day (the steroid one), or a fast-acting one in case I go to a friend's place who has a cat. I can't get sick because I can't afford to miss work, and I can't afford to see a doctor. I have a weird mole I'm worried about and I can't see a doctor. I have a severely impacted wisdom tooth that's hurting three teeth in front of it that I can't see anyone for. Hell I haven't had a cleaning in well over five years. The only thing I save up enough to do anything for are my awful eyes that I end up paying *at least* $500 out of pocket for, because without my glasses I'm totally fucked. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f<damnisuckatreddit>: Bro buy your glasses off the internet. I've been using zenni for the last five years, cost about $25 per pair and I couldn't be happier with them. Optometrists will try to convince you they're shit quality or whatever but none of my optometrists have ever been able to tell my glasses were bought online, even when they use them to get my baseline rx. For the inhaler stuff, if you haven't tried yet you should contact the manufacturer. My stepdad needs a truly absurd amount of inhalers every month and he gets some kind of discount through the company that makes them. I think a lot of places have programs to get their meds to folks who can't afford them because they know if they get you on their brand you'll keep buying from when when you have insurance again. Tooth stuff, look for dental schools in your area. Cheap or sometimes free care. Dunno what to do about the mole though. I guess just try to keep tabs on it? Make sure it doesn't grow or change shape or color or whatever.<yodamy>: THANK YOU &lt;3 Did not know of this. Need new glasses and sunglasses.

I just don't really see a moral values difference in the two diseases to begrudge either getting treated. But things should definitely be fixed when it comes to the costs of diabetes medicines, you're right. My household spends in the high thousands yearly on diabetes supplies and meds, and I have clients who frequently go without because of costs.<themoistinator>: So... Maybe you can tell me. Why does a drug addict get free drugs and a diabetic has to pay for their drugs? Or a cancer patient?

Drug addicts get very low-cost or free life-saving drugs. Diabetics must pay through the nose. I just don't get it<LatrodectusGeometric>: One kills you much faster than the other. Unfortunately public health is trying to stop hemorrhaging where opioid overdoses are involved. The big funding for diabetes is going into pushing healthier lifestyles, better diets, and more exercise, as well as ensuring that diabetics have access to disease-mitigating care like regular retinal and foot exams. Metformin isn\u2019t bad, thank goodness, and cheap regular insulin is available in a pinch, but the really good stuff is likely going to be expensive for a long time.<themoistinator>: Good things. But one is a choice and one is not. That's probably my biggest problem. Ex opioid user. Heavy user. One day I was just done with it. And I quit. It was prescribed to me 120 pills per month that was a 10 300 prescription of Oxycodone. I didn't like what it was doing to me and so I quit. Anybody can quit. But nobody forced me to take opioids. I took them voluntarily albeit at the behest of my doctor who prescribe them. But I did make a choice. My sister-in-law did not make a choice. I just don't understand the disparity<LatrodectusGeometric>: Unless you have type 1 diabetes, diabetes is mostly a disease of lifestyle. Many people will argue that it is a choice. It's perhaps not the best example here. <themoistinator>: So what you're saying is that junkies are just like people with diabetes?

You often see people referencing breasts on a scale of A-DD from smallest to largest. In reality though, D-DD is at the relatively small-average end of the scale. While many big box stores only go up to D-DD (the source of confusion I believe), stores that specialize in bras have a scale like this- <US>: A, B, C, D, E (DD), F (DDD), G, H, I, J, K+... <UK>: A, B, C, D, DD, E (DDD), F, FF, G, GG... **The importance of band size** Going back to the kiwi and the cantaloupe, I brought that up because you can have two women who wear a size DD, but the actual volume of breast tissue can be wildly different. For example- 28C vs 34C These are two different band sizes with the same cup size. *Proportional to their bodies*, it\u2019s the same size, however the 28C is going to be a smaller breast than the 34C. This is where it gets a bit confusing. Bras have a concept called \u201csister sizing\u201d where if you go down a band, you go up a cup size. So if you were to take those 34Cs and reduce them to a 28 band equivalent, you\u2019d convert roughly to a 28DDD. That girl with the 28DDD sounds like she has huge boobs, but they are the \u201csame\u201d size as a 34C which doesn\u2019t sound quite so big. Proportionally the 28DDD has more breast tissue compared to chest than the 34C, but someone still may not think that they look very \u201cbig\u201d. You simply can\u2019t have a blanket image for what a \u201cDD\u201d breast should look like, because it depends on who\u2019s body it\u2019s on.

It helped me to find my proper fit and be more comfortable, but even so, someone may scoff at me for sharing my size because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t look *that* big\u201d. I think that if more people were educated on sizing, it would lift a lot of ignorance from the whole subject-for males *and* females who don\u2019t yet know these things. <Edit>: wanted to add [this bra size calculator](https://www.abrathatfits.org/calculator.php) that I found helpful in discovering my proper size! <scru>: Additionally, because most stores only carry Sizes 34A - 38 or 40DD, most women are wearing the wrong bra size! Even if you get fitted by a saleswoman, they will pigeonhole you into one of those sizes in order to sell to you. I thought I wore a 34 or 36B until I was 23 years old. Turns out I wear a 28DD/E! Please check out /r/ABraThatFits, grab a tape measure, and find out your actual size!<AmyVictoria>: Victoria's secret fitter said I was a fucking 36C and I am a 38AA at best. big ol ribcage with barely any tiddy.<Jinxwinks>: I recommend [this calculator ](https://www.abrathatfits.org/calculator.php) if you have a measuring tape. It might surprise you how little breast tissue it takes to be more than an A. However, if that is your true size then I hope you\u2019ve found a comfortable bra! <jeegte12>: Why would As need a bra?<Jinxwinks>: There\u2019s still some breast to cover. Also, nipple coverage. Also, just because they are small, it doesn\u2019t mean that they shouldn\u2019t get to feel sexy wearing a nice bra (if that\u2019s what they wanna do). <jeegte12>: so no practical reasons? i thought that's the whole point of wearing bras but okay<Jinxwinks>: The nipple coverage is a pretty \u201cpractical\u201d reason I think. <jeegte12>: why is this different from guys though?<Jinxwinks>: People don\u2019t care about guy nipples?

You can wear CRT lenses which are simply contacts only worn while sleeping. You take them off during the day.

Only downside is each lens costs at least a couple hundred USD and you cannot lose them. You wear same lens pair for like 3 years before changing <Edit>: forgot to say why.

The recommended dose of acetaminophen in adults is 650 to 1,000 mg every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 4,000 mg in a 24-hour period; in children, the recommended dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 50 to 70 mg/kg in 24 hours.

Maybe aspirin or ibuprofen?<Jerl>: Aspirin after drinking is also a very bad idea, since both alcohol and aspirin can cause stomach bleeding, and taking them together significantly increases the risk. That risk is much smaller with other NSAID's (such as ibuprofen), but still there.<wintervenom123>: What is the risk exactly, everybody in this thread is mentioning possible side effects but no statistics on how common they actually are, without this context this thread is a pointless exercise in listing words we remember. <Edit>: There is no proof that mild to moderate alcohol use significantly increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients taking aspirin, especially if the aspirin is taken only as needed. However, people who consumed at least 3-5 drinks daily and who regularly took more than 325 mg of aspirin did have a high risk of bleeding. <https>://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/should-consumers-be-warned-about-aspirin-alcohol-and-gastric-bleeding <https>://www.nature.com/articles/ajg1999733 Compared with those who drank less than one drink/wk, the relative risk of acute UGIB increased with increasing alcohol consumption, rising to 2.8 among those who drank \u226521 drinks/wk. Among current drinkers, the relative risk of acute UGIB due to the use of aspirin was raised at all levels of alcohol consumption; the estimate for aspirin taken at least every other day (regular use) at doses of &gt;325 mg among all current drinkers combined was 7.0; for regular use at lower doses, the corresponding estimate was 2.8, and for any occasional use, it was 2.4. All estimates were statistically significant. Data for ibuprofen were more limited, but the relative risk estimates did not appear to vary consistently with level of alcohol consumption. For regular use (all doses combined), the estimate among all drinkers combined was significantly elevated, at 2.7; occasional ibuprofen use was not associated with UGIB (1.2). There were insufficient data to evaluate other NSAIDs according to alcohol consumption. So the risk is minuscule unless you like combining alcoholism with daily aspirin. For occasional alcohol and occasional use of aspirin, what most people do. It is relatively harmless. An interesting thing I found in the study was that never drinkers, with no aspirin or ibuprofen, had a relative risk of 1.5, which is larger than 1 per week drinkers. That's weird and they don't seem to think it's worthy of discussion, lol. Drinking initially has a lowering risk effect then goes to have the opposite. Never drinkers who occasionally took aspirin, had a 1.4,which is lower than the non drinking, non aspirin taking group. Weird again. Edit 2: forgot to finish a sentence. <lgspeck>: Imho taking aspirin for pain doesn't make sense pharmacologically. Its worse than basically all other NSAIDs for pain control and it binds irreversibly to thrombocytes. So some people, and I have had one case similar to this this year, get a really bad headache, and take some aspirin for it. Turns out that headache was an aneurysm that popped. That aspirin just killed that person. So nevermind ulcers... I just watched die hard 3 today and cringed at how many aspirin pills McClane takes, even after multiple head injuries... <wintervenom123>: https://www.rcoa.ac.uk/faculty-of-pain-medicine/opioids-aware/oxford-league-table Well not necessarily worse for pain relief according to the oxford table,which is recommended source of information from this study on NSAIDs effectiveness. <https>://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1855338/ 1200mg can be as effective for pain relief as a the dose of morphine they set as control. Just saying. The most effective drugs would have a low NNT of approximately 2. This means that for every two patients who receive the drug, one patient will get at least 50% relief due to the treatment (the other patient may or may not obtain relief but it does not reach the 50% level). A NNT of 2, which is the best, means that 50 out of 100 patients will get at least 50% relief specifically due to the treatment. Another 20 may have a placebo response giving them at least 50% relief. As an example, ibuprofen 400 mg has a NNT of 2.4 on the league table, therefore approximately 62 (42+20) of 100 patients in total will have effective pain relief. For comparison, 10 mg intramuscular morphine with a NNT of 2.9 will provide approximately 54 (34+20) of 100 patients with effective pain relief. Ibuprofen seems more effective for pain relief but not.by much and it's very dose dependent. The most effective is ibuprofen plus paracetamol. I've read papers on pain relief for kids post surgery and it seems to be more effective while having less risks than 5 to 10 mg doses of morphine. <https>://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4463911/ Even though a direct comparison of efficacy between different drugs is, in principle, a valuable guide to clinical application, creating an average value with a wide margin of error that lacks applicability to particular clinical scenarios may be problematic. For example, a drug that is well-suited to one pain setting may have a different effect or no effect at all in another. Hence, the information provided in the Oxford League Table should be interpreted in light of the specific pain symptoms, which need to be treated, and used as an approximate guide concerning the relative efficacy of analgesics. <lgspeck>: I'm sceptical about using this table. Notice how 1200 aspirin is disproportionatelly more potent than 1000?<wintervenom123>: I don't share this view. Look at the spread and confidence interval. Aspirin 1000 is slightly bellow 4. While 1200 ranges from 2 to 4, meaning that only fewer data point's were gathered, likely because at that point more potent drugs would be given. So the table is consistent with itself if that was your problem. The Cochrane Collaboration (www.the-cochranelibrary.com) has now published an overview of systematicreviews of single-dose oral analgesics in acute pain. . The overview included 35 separate Cochrane reviews of single-dose oral analgesics tested at different doses in acute postoperative pain models;the reviews included about 350 individual studies with about45,000 patients. It updates and extends the Oxford league table of analgesics in acute pain. The oxford table was made in 2007, this in 2012. I have not been able to find an even newer table but since the studies pretty much agree completly I find it would be of a little use.

[Here is a link to a literature review that concludes significant risk.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1905885/) &gt;Spinal manipulation, particularly when performed on the upper spine, is frequently associated with mild to moderate adverse effects. It can also result in serious complications such as vertebral artery dissection followed by stroke. Currently, the incidence of such events is not known. In the interest of patient safety we should reconsider our policy towards the routine use of spinal manipulation. I know a lot of people love going to the chiropractor. A close friend of mine just spent Thanksgiving in the ICU with her husband; he had a vascular dissection that the doctor thinks is likely from neck manipulations, that led to a series of strokes. He's now in long term rehab. He is *uninsured.* It's super fucked up that this isn't common knowledge, regardless of how \"rare\" it might be. &amp;#x200B; They think he should be able to make a full recovery, but it's going to take a good long while. <micahhorner>: Chiropractic just gets more fascinating and absurd the more you look into it. A profession-wide survey, [How Chiropractors Think and Practice (2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1543115004000377), published by the Institute for Social Research at Ohio Northern University, confirmed that the MAJORITY of chiropractors still hold views of \"Innate\" as the cause and cure of ALL disease (not just back pain), consistent with the beliefs of the founder of chiropractic, D.D. Palmer. In case you're confused, and wondering what \"Innate\" is: \"In 1895, a magnetic healer named D. D. Palmer adjusted a deaf man\u2019s back and allegedly restored his hearing. He decided that when a bone was out of place, it pressed on a nerve and impaired the flow of \"Innate\" (always capitalized), his word for a **mythical vitalistic force** that allowed the body to heal itself. At one point he talked of establishing chiropractic as a religion\". [https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/science-and-chiropractic/](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/science-and-chiropractic/) <EDIT>: I forgot the most bizarre part. D.D. Palmer claims he got his knowledge of \"Innate\" from a ghost: <https>://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-chiropractic-quackery-20170630-story.html D.D. and his son B.J. also became bitter rivals.

Tarantino would have a field day.<orange_fuckin_peel>: as ridiculous as it sounds, is that not IMPOSSIBLE ?<micahhorner>: Anything is *possible*.

So far, the field of chiropractic can provide none.<orange_fuckin_peel>: Got to delete comment, the replies are getting insanely off topic even after explaining that they're arguing something different lol<d9_m_5>: That's not how the burden of proof works. Modern medicine makes provable predictions, so if it shouldn't work given how we know the body works, we shouldn't just assume it could be true. That is, the null hypothesis should be that any given unscientific claim in this area is false.<bigbigpure1>: devils advocate here so science is a theory right, a lot of what we claim to know is based on assumptions that cant be proved so by your logic why should we trust science and by extension modern medicine we dont look at things and know this does long list of effects goes here its more like we we observe the effects so we know what the effects tend to be, it does not mean we understand those effects or even why it is like it is or does what it does, we often just know it does e.g a hell of a lot of meds dealing with the brain so we can observe that a chiropractor can do good work, we dont know why but we can make that observation, so why is it better to trust observations of people who have a stake in it (people fund studies get the results they want all of the time) over people who have been helped by it we can take it further and look at certain practices in Chinese medicine and see a similar belief in a flow of the bodies energy, so its not like this belief is a one off, it has came to be popular across multiple countries &gt;. Modern medicine makes provable predictions, so if it shouldn't work given how we know the body works i think you may want to do some digging on that here is a good start https://ideas.ted.com/the-hidden-truth-about-our-prescription-medications/ <edit>: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis try to remember im playing the devils advocate, i am not anti science or modern medicine but its important to look at it sceptically given the current crisis we are facing as to not lose credibility<TheSecondHuman>: I didn\u2019t read your argument because I got annoyed right at the start. Science isn\u2019t a theory, it\u2019s a body of knowledge capable of self-correction through a standard method (i.e. the scientific method). Please refrain from arguing points of view about topics you obviously know nothing about. <bigbigpure1>: im putting this at the top not the bottom since you dont seem to read very far Darwin's theory of evolution collision theory, kinetic theory of gases, Lewis theory, molecular theory, molecular orbital theory, transition state theory, valence bond theory.Biology: cell theory, theory of evolution, germ theory, particulate inheritance theory, dual inheritance theory. noticing a pattern here bud? the people who know about these fields are calling it a theory maybe you should tell them Science isn\u2019t a theory <https>://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory &gt; it\u2019s a body of knowledge capable of self-correction through a standard method definition of theory \"a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something, especially one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained.\" its a theory &gt; Please refrain from arguing points of view about topics you obviously know nothing about. said the person who did not read the argument but at the end of the day, its a theory, all science is theory its often the best one we have but pretending its not a theory is just silly &gt;Please refrain from arguing points of view about topics you obviously know nothing about. i have no problem with you arguing about something you dont seem to know anything about bud, how else will you improve, but at least read the damn post before responding. <TheSecondHuman>: Cute, but you obviously still have no idea what you're talking about. All you've done is list theories within the scientific disciplines. Did you bother reading the link that you just posted? Here, let me help you. A scientific theory is not a science, it is an accumulation of data-supported hypotheses that attempt to explain phenomena in the natural world. The definition from your link: &gt;A scientific theory is an explanation of an aspect of the natural world that can be repeatedly tested and verified in accordance with the scientific method, using accepted protocols of observation, measurement, and evaluation of results. Lookie there, pretty much the same except my definition is simpler. Now, if we look through that wikipedia page you linked, we can skim through and we see a link in the form of \"disciplines of science.\" The \"disciplines\" of course being chemistry, physics, biology, etc. Now, on THAT page, we see a link called the \"sciences.\" If we click here we get--whaddya know, pal!--the wikipedia article for SCIENCE. WHICH IS DEFINED AS SUCH: &gt;Science (from Latin scientia, meaning \"knowledge\")[1] is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. Which is, basically, a much more thorough and complete definition than mine, but similar nonetheless. So thanks for helping me prove my point.<bigbigpure1>: so a theory is a system of ideas intended to explain something Science (from Latin scientia, meaning \"knowledge\")[1] is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. so how is it not a theory a \"is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions\" is a \"system of ideas intended to explain something\" &gt;All you've done is list theories within the scientific disciplines. what else is there? a discipline is how we group the theories together, its simply a specific branch of knowledge so you are not disproving what im saying, i think you missed the point of it too &gt;So thanks for helping me prove my point same to you i guess <imVINCE>: Bro you have literally no clue how science works.<bigbigpure1>: well if that is true then the university of Berkeley also has no clue how science works... <https>://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/howscienceworks_19 you cant have science with out theory, all of science is based on one theory or another even down to how we measure things which i go in to with another person if you are interested <Sloppy1sts>: You are saying that science itself is a theory. No, science is a methodology to learn and apply new information. Science is how you create sound theories. Science itself is not a testable hypothesis supported by evidence. Science is not a theory. And Berkley is not saying that science is a theory. &gt;you cant have science with out theory, all of science is based on one theory or another even down to how we measure things which i go in to with another person if you are interested This is all true, but what you seem to be saying is that, because you can't have science without theories (true) that science *is* a theory (false). No. Science is used to create theories but that does not mean science itself is a theory.<bigbigpure1>: this is the simplest explanation i can find <https>://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/11/22/scientific-proof-is-a-myth/ &gt;Science itself is not a testable hypothesis so how do you know science works? &gt; supported by evidence do you really think science is not supported by evidence? so we know that science works because it has been tested so it checks off your first point, we have lots of evidence supporting the usefulness of science so theres your second again you misunderstand the meaning of the words used, a hypothesis is not a theory, its guess based on little information<Sloppy1sts>: No, *you're* not understanding what I mean when I say \"science\". Your link talking about scientific theories in the same way I am. You're equating \"science\" with \"scientific theories\". When I say \"science\" I mean doing the things required to create and test a scientific theory. &gt;so how do you know science works? Logic? \"If we test this and it works, it works\". No duh? &gt;do you really think science is not supported by evidence? I mean, I guess you could test how well the scientific method works. That's a phrase I should have used earlier, and it's what I'm getting at. Science is the scientific method of testing hypotheses and creating theories from the results. &gt;again you misunderstand the meaning of the words used, a hypothesis is not a theory, its guess based on little information That is an insignificant and frankly irrelevant part of my comment that you've latched on to in an attempt to prove me wrong. Hypotheses become or are turned into theories as their supporting evidence grows or manipulates our understanding of the situation.<bigbigpure1>: &gt;you've latched on to in an attempt to prove me wrong. now that is some projection right there, of my comment you desided to talk about if science is technically a theory or not &gt;. That's a phrase I should have used earlier, and it's what I'm getting at. Science is the scientific method of testing hypotheses and creating theories from the results. \"Science is the scientific method of testing hypotheses \" \"A scientific theory is an explanation of an aspect of the natural world that can be repeatedly tested and verified in accordance with the scientific method\" so its a theory, science is the theory of how we do science", "num_messages": 17, "avg_score": 640.1764705882}

What you see is what you get; the only concern here is when people dont understand the tools they're using.<deepfield67>: This is one of the main differences between the .jpg and .png file formats, correct? Preserved layers?<RedditTab>: Not in this context. Png has an alpha layer (transparent \"color\"), jpg does not. .psd (photoshop) files preserve the work environment of the artist. This includes all of the layers (think pieces of paper that overlap to create art). Sometimes artists will apply effects to individual layers, or use layers as a mask and apply to all of the other layers and save the results as a jpg or png for sharing. For this reason, if anyone contracts digital artists for their work you should negotiate up front based on which file(s) you receive. (Will you edit it later or not?) <Source>: I'm a game dev hobbyist that uses these programs to support that. Additionally, I'm a business analyst/project manager that works with professional artists. As a side note:if you take pictures with your phone disable GPS meta data before sharing your pictures. Unrelated to the original post but related to the concept of what's shared with files. Facebook used to be a gold mine of creepy stalking before they started filtering the data for users.<deepfield67>: Awesome answer! Thank you for taking the time to explain. If I can trouble you for just a bit more info. What is the purpose of the alpha layer in .PNG files?<RedditTab>: An alpha layer tells the computer where not to draw anything. Imagine a logo, like Ford's, where it is oval shaped. If you dont have a logo with a transparent layer the \"not oval\" part will end up having to be white (or maybe black). This means if you put the logo on top of another image or different color background you'll clearly see the white rectangle around the logo. With a transparent layer the artist can erase or delete the white background and save it for use so that only the logo is visible. The end result is, when you're stacking it on other images, you'll only see the logo and not the \"white space\" around it. This I'd especially vital for website and game design, because all image files are rectangular, but not all images fill the canvas. (So, whitespace or deadspace). The downside is that pngs are usually larger to compensate. (They have more data to store). However, this size is typically negligible. (Especially if you use a service like tinypng which does some magic to shrink the file size tremendously).<deepfield67>: Thank you!

PCV <RV>: This third dose may be needed, depending on the brand of vaccine used in previous RV immunizations. 6 months and annually Influenza (Flu): The flu vaccine is recommended every year for children 6 months and older: Kids younger than 9 who get the flu vaccine for the first time (or who have only had one dose before July 2017) will get it in two separate doses at least a month apart. Those younger than 9 who have had at least two doses of flu vaccine previously (in the same or different seasons) will only need one dose. Kids older than 9 only need one dose. The vaccine is given by injection with a needle (the flu shot) or by nasal spray. The flu shot is preferred for children of all ages because it has been shown to be safe and effective. Although the nasal spray was not used in recent years, a changed version of it is now recommended (for the 2018\u20132019 flu season) for kids who may otherwise not get a flu shot. The nasal spray is only for healthy people ages 2 through 49.

Unlike the meningococcal conjugate vaccine, which is recommended, the MenB vaccine is given at the discretion of the doctor. Special circumstances HepA is also recommended for kids 2 years and older and adults who are at high risk for the disease. This includes people who live in, travel to, or adopt children from areas with high rates of hepatitis A; people with clotting disorders; and people with chronic liver disease. The vaccine also can be given to anyone who desires immunity to the disease, and is useful for staff at childcare facilities or schools where they may be at risk of exposure. The MMR vaccine can be given to babies as young as 6 months old if they will be traveling internationally. These children should still get the recommended routine doses at 12\u201315 months and 4\u20136 years of age, but can get the second dose as early as 4 weeks after the first if they will still be traveling and at risk. During a mumps outbreak, children older than 1 year of age who are in close contact with infected people should get another dose of the vaccine, no matter how many doses they have already had. The flu vaccine is especially important for kids who are at risk for health problems from the flu. High-risk groups include, but aren't limited to, kids younger than 5 years old and those with chronic medical conditions, such as asthma, heart problems, sickle cell disease, diabetes, or HIV. The meningococcal vaccines can be given to kids as young as 8 weeks old (depending on the brand of vaccine) who are at risk for a meningococcal infection, such as meningitis. This includes children with certain immune disorders. Kids who live in (or will be traveling to) countries where meningitis is common, or where there is an outbreak, should also get the vaccine. Pneumococcal vaccines also can be given to older kids (age 2 and up) who have conditions that affect their immune systems, such as asplenia or HIV infection, or other conditions, like a cochlear implant, chronic heart disease, or chronic lung disease. <Source>: https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/immunization-chart.html<justalilblowby>: YSalsoK, all vaccines have formaldehyde, tolulene, aborted human fetal cells, DNA/other growth mediums from other species such as bovine, porcine, mokey, chicken cells., aluminium and mercury as adjuvants (which are know to be Neuro and cardio toxic.<agentMICHAELscarnTLM>: Jesus Christ man.

Continuous use without allowing time for your eyes to recover can result in the tissue feeling starved of oxygen, even in high oxygen transmission lenses. This results in the eye growing new blood vessels to supply the tissue. This presents as red rings around the iris. Providing relief to the eye can alleviate the redness, but carves \"trenches\" into the tissue that allows the regrowth to occur much faster if you return to the same habits.<Nobodyville>: I wear AirOptix by CibaVision for this exact reason, they allow much more air through than a regular set of contacts. I'm sure there are similar brands out there. I have never slept in my contacts save a few nights here or there, but I've worn contacts for upwards of 25 years. I was getting neovascularization around my cornea and so I switched lenses. It literally felt like an air conditioner blowing in my eyes for about a week until I acclimated, but since then my eye doc informs me the little veins have emptied and shrunk. So if this is a concern know you can ask your optometrist/ ophthalmologist about different lens options. Also know, if you're a long term diabetic or uncontrolled diabetic you can get neovascularization on the back of your eye which can cause bleeding and damage, even blindness. There are laser treatments and injections to control it (yes, injections into your eyeball) . . . But it's best not to have this problem to begin with. If you think it's an issue get to an ophthalmologist and get checked.

They've barely been identified, let alone had conclusive studies done on them. If we assume you're right for the sake of argument, then how is it possible for anyone to reason that it's the cause of OP's troubles? Wouldn't one need to both identify the chemical he had taken as well as have a conclusive study linking it to his diagnosis? This all sounds like a load of *post hoc ergo propter hoc*.<mammalian>: Man is fine. Man ingests unknown chemical substance and suddenly, for the first time, develops symptoms of severe mental illness. Testing shows he has brain damage. While this isn't proof positive that the chemicals caused the damage, or that the damage caused the symptoms, it's a reasonable assumption. If I fell on my head and forgot how to talk, and brain scans showed damage, that wouldn't be absolute proof that one thing led to the other either. It could have been a coincidence, it might be psychosomatic, it could be the result of some previously undiagnosed and unknown disease process. Probably the blow to the head though.<Erastotle>: Would you agree that falling on your head has been conclusively linked to brain injury? Because the person to whom I replied ( /u/frogdoubler ) said that synthetic cannabis is decidedly not linked to brain injury. Therefore there isn't any connection between your first case \u2013 which is a textbook example of the post hoc fallacy \u2013 and your second case which seems a perfectly reasonable assumption. /u/frogdoubler seemed to be offering support to the OP. But their post and OPs post cannot both be true at the same time. I just hoped they might be elucidated by that irony. <mammalian>: I think the issue is that there is no common agreement on what constitutes \"synthetic pot\". That's what brings in the \"unknown chemical\" factor. Since we have no way of knowing exactly what this guy smoked, and the change in cognition immediately followed, I think it's reasonable to assume the chemical was the causative factor. There aren't any definitive studies on what he smoked, because we don't even know what it was.<Erastotle>: First of all, nearly every single person that has a medical issue of any kind has consumed an \"unknown chemical\" shortly before the issue was discovered. I personally know at least half a dozen people who claim they had \"food poisoning\" after eating at some restaurant. And yet none of them were told that by a doctor or interviewed by the government agency concerned with the safety of the food supply. And because I know food poisoning is *deadly* serious for not just the individual, but society as a whole, then I'd bet every single one of them just got something like the flu and then blamed it on the last place that they ate before they got sick. And what's more, food poisoning can probably go unnoticed for days before it presents itself. Why do so many people assume it's the last place they ate, then? Because the post hoc fallacy is a temptress. Second of all, I have no clue where you get the idea that \"the change in cognition immediately followed\" if you're referring to OP. Because in their post they said \"[o]ver the course of a year.\" Third of all, I don't know what your point is anymore. If you agree that we don't know what he smoked. If you agree that even if we did know, it isn't studied. Then all we can say is that we should dig deeper to find out if the two are linked. What we can't do however, is assign *any* probability to how likely it was to cause his symptoms.<mammalian>: I'm not that interested in this argument, but I thought you should know that food poisoning is considered extremely common. While it's true that people can die from it, that's relatively rare. Most people just get diarrhea and vomiting that lasts a few hours. Also, while it can take as long as weeks to show symptoms, that's also relatively rare. Usually the symptoms show up within a few hours. <Source>: Google it<Erastotle>: [\"5-20% of U.S. residents get the flu each year\"](http://infomory.com/numbers/number-of-flu-cases-per-year/). Taking the median value of 12.5% multiplied by [327,829,439](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/) is 40,978,679.875. [\"In the United States, foodborne diseases have been estimated to cause 6 million to 81 million illnesses\u2026 each year\"](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/5/5/99-0502_article) that median number is 43.5 million. Therefore, the flu can be about as common as food poisoning. We know people get sick from the flu. We know people have eaten shortly before they got sick from the flu. My point is that it's dumb to assume food poisoning when it could just as easily have been the flu.<mammalian>: It's also dumb to assume it's never food poisoning. <Erastotle>: You're right.

Plex Media Server Explained in Plain English - NAS and PC * What is Plex and How do I use it - in 4 Minutes * PLEX Media Server Review - What is Plex? Wiki is not required. You're making excuses for laziness.<chicknfly>: Let's play this out. 1. Poster asks, you don't say anything. Dude doesn't get an answer. 2. Poster asks, you waste time and go out of your way to tell the guy to Google it. Poster still gets no answer, and now you also look like an ass. 3. Spend that same amount of time helping the person (which you won't do because it perpetuates laziness) The primary argument I'm making is to say something useful or say nothing at all. How is that making an excuse for his laziness? You literally contributed *nothing* with your initial post and went out of your way to be arrogant. And that, my friend, is called being a dick.<Scase15>: Teaching someone to think and perform things themselves is not useless. Enabling people to take the laziest route and have other people do simple and menial tasks for them, is arguably more harmful. There is nothing arrogant about posting a link, there was no text, no tone, no comment. Just simply a link to a google search. Just because _you_ got your panties in a bunch doesn't indicate me being a dick. It's showing someone how to find answers without relying on random people to do the work for them. Stop acting altruistically because you answered a simple question.<chicknfly>: You're not teaching them anything with that link other than you're trying to tell them to Google it. You could have offered the link directly to the search query, but instead you chose an animation that arrogantly portrays your thoughts. I'm not even annoyed with you. I'm annoyed at the propogation of this stupid animation because it literally does nothing in any context it's used. It's a tired joke, and nobody laughs at it. Nobody ever thinks \"oh, yeah, what a great idea.\" It's about as worthless and douchey as people clapping when a waiter/waitress accidentally drops dishes.<Scase15>: It's not supposed to be a joke. It's supposed to shame people into doing something for themselves. I chose not to offer a direct link to anything because they might be someone who prefers to read, or watch videos etc. They can choose their method of learning by simply searching for the info and then choosing from the options available. It's just irritating to see people take more time to make a reddit post asking what something is, when you can not only find your answer but, fully read/watch/digest the answer well before anyone could feasibly answer the question in a reply.<chicknfly>: True. The same could be said about the entire ELI5 subreddit, though. Sometimes it's as easy as skimming through a few of Google's top links and compiling your own understanding. That is completely the case with this Plex question. In some instances, however, it's extraordinarily difficult to find a straight forward answer (or one that makes sense). Just this past week, I went through three academic textbooks and dozens of text- and video tutorials on how to use the Hungarian algorithm for finding matching sets of a directed graph. There's plenty of material on it, none of which makes enough sense. Honestly, if Plex Man above us actually cared enough to know, he would have searched for it and got the answer he wanted. I posted knowing that there's probably someone (maybe several people!) out there who doesn't know what Plex is, and I just spared them that effort. A little time spent on my part saved lots of time overall. I'm cool with that.<Scase15>: I agree with you for the most part about ELI5 but, it does have it's uses for complicated things that you can't find a simple explanation for.", "num_messages": 19, "avg_score": 480.4210526316}

I asked a few people and someone found an article about it and here's the gist of it; to understand this (admittedly well done) scam you need to know two things: 1.- How is it that it looks like I sent it myself? \"From: spoofing\" is hard to explain but essentially it means that, if you know what you're doing, you can make the receiver of your email think that it was sent from a different address, even their own. 2.- How did they get my password? There are basically two options; - You got caught in some kind of phishing and accidentally gave you password away to someone with malicious intent. - One or more of the websites you use was hacked and your e-mail address and password you use for that site got posted somewhere on the internet for all to see. Now, how do you fix it? First we need to be sure that it actually wasn't sent from your account, so go to your \"sent\" folder and check whether or not you actually sent it; If not, then go to the next step. ~~If it WAS sent from your account, get help from someone that knows more about this than me because it means your e-mail account has indeed been broken into and that's a WAAAAY bigger problem.~~ Edit: I'm not completely sure how legit this is but according to this article https://www.tomsguide.com/us/spam-gmail-sent-folder,news-27042.html it's possible for spam to actually appear in your \"sent\" folder. I'd still be cautious though. Now, about the password: There's basically NOTHING you can do about it except changing your password, but don't just change it to another easy one, so listen: there's this program I just found out about called KeePass, it's free and open source, which means it's not a \"trade your privacy in return of it being free\", but a project people contribute to to help others out. The program lets you store your passwords in an encrypted file that's only accessible by a master password. Having this program, there's no excuse to have an \"easy to remember\" password to use everywhere. It generates random passwords for you to use and you can just store them in your file. To create a very secure master password, ~~this xkcd is pretty useful https://www.xkcd.com/936/~~ (Edit: yeah, after quite a lot of people commented about it, I realize that the xkcd doesn't really show the full picture. There are more things that go into it. This article is much more useful: https://crambler.com/password-security-why-secure-passwords-need-length-over-complexity/ ) but I'd also recommend to NEVER. GIVE. YOUR. MASTER. PASSWORD. AWAY. don't make ANY accounts with it, no matter how much you trust the site. And for the love of god, when creating a password file READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY. Frequently Back up the password file to a secure cloud server like google drive and, if you can, print the file that it gives you so you can recover your passwords if somehow the whole file gets lost or you forget the master password. I really hope I helped someone to not have such a bad time as me if an e-mail like this reaches you. If I made a dangerous mistake in anything that I said here, feel free to correct me and I'll edit it. <Edit>: someone pointed out something that I wanted to add but forgot. If you want to know if a password associated to your email address has been leaked, check out https://haveibeenpwned.com <Edit>: this one's kinda common sense but yes, if you can get 2-factor authentication, do it. Not all sited have the option but this way, even if your password gets leaked, no one can get into your account without your phone.<Scrambles720>: Getting a spoofed email does not signify that they know your password. You can spoof an email without knowing the password<pitchbend>: You didn't understand. They not only spoof your email the also include your password in plain text in the email to show that they know it. They know it because it was part of a hacked database.<Jasong222>: Current password? I had this happen but it was a very old password that I gave up using 4 maybe 5 years or more ago.<pitchbend>: Yeah this depends on how often you change passwords, for some people that rarely change it might be a current password, for others like you it might not, also it dependes of when the hack where your password was dumped occurred.<Jasong222>: Oop. Yeah I guess I thought you were op. I meant to ask him if the password in the email was his current. I know password techniques vary with people but I guess I kinda assumed that changing your password at least occasionally (every couple years?) had become more widely practised. <nddragoon>: The password I got on the email wasn't for any important account. It was mostly for social media and other accounts that don't matter to me too much. Still scared the fuck out of me and I changed ALL my passwords.", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 414.8571428571}

Okay, so the language spoken in Mexico is the same as that of the Basque Country and Asturias?<lmiartegtra>: I don't think you're picking up what I'm putting down. Castilian is the branch from which these languages branch off of. Mexican and whatever language is spoken in Asturias are both classified as Castilian in the same way as both cats and lions are felines. Feline is the classification then lion/ house cat is the specific species. You can technically call Spanish Castilian in the same way you can call it Latin. It is but if you wanna be more specific than all of southern Europe you're gonna have to be a bit more specific than that. On the whole you're technically right but you're just a bit backwards. Castilian isn't Spanish Castilian is the classification of languages within Spain. I'm not saying that all people that speak a Castilian language would be speaking the same language the same way as I'm not saying that you're speaking Italian because you're speaking a Latin language (well bit of Germanic and a hint of Norman as well, we (the UK) got invaded a LOT over the years. I don't get it tho. All we have is chalk. Who the fuck wants chalk) Spanish, however, is Spanish. The language spoken in Asturias isn't Spanish if they're not speaking Spanish. It might be Castilian but it's not the more specific language of Spanish. Do you understand.<Mark-Wahlberg1929>: Are you aware that \u201cspanish\u201d and asturian are completely different? Castillian is the language of castille, someone from Castilla La Mancha can communicate with someone from panama, because they both have the same language. On the other hand, if you had a Mexican or a Peruvian come up to someone who only knew asturian the conversation would go like this: <Asturian>: Va munchu tiempu que nun mos ve\u00edemos <Mexican>: che loco no te entiendo <Asturian>: nun entiendo <Mexican>: habla castellano por favor <Asturian>: \u00bfpue repetir? <rosso_dixit>: Hey, Peruvan here. This is minor, but since you seem to live and breath on technicalities, Mexicans don't ever say \"che loco\", that would be Argentineans. As a native speaker of (Peruvian) Spanish, and as a university professor of Spanish and Literature, I see your point, but it's extremely negligible among my fellow scholars. Perhaps linguists of prescriptivist leanings may join you in your quest to educate the world, but there aren't many of them.

[http://www.opdv.ny.gov/professionals/abusers/coercivecontrol.html](http://www.opdv.ny.gov/professionals/abusers/coercivecontrol.html) &gt;**Coercive Control** &gt; &gt;Domestic violence comprises a range of behaviors beyond physical and emotional abuse. Abusers often use violence, intimidation, degradation and isolation to deprive victims of their rights to physical security, dignity and respect. Evan Stark has been encouraging the use of \u201ccoercive control\u201d to describe a course of oppressive behavior grounded in gender-based privilege. While all forms of abuse are about power and control, coercive control is a strategic form of ongoing oppression and terrorism that invades all arenas of women\u2019s activity by limiting access to money and other basic resources. In addition, few elements of coercive control are currently considered criminal, or are only crimes when committed against strangers, which further complicates this issue within the context of domestic violence. &gt; &gt;This Q and A was conducted with Evan Stark, Ph.D. MSW, a forensic social worker and Professor Emeritus at Rutgers University. &gt; &gt;**Q: What is Coercive Control?** &gt; &gt;**A:** Coercive control is a strategic course of oppressive behavior designed to secure and expand gender-based privilege by depriving women of their rights and liberties and establishing a regime of domination in personal life. This definition reminds us that women are often targets of violence. I wrote Coercive Control (Oxford, 2007) to examine the oppressive tactics some males used to dominate women. &gt; &gt;Coercive control refers to abuse as a \u201cstrategic course of oppressive behavior,\u201d meaning that battering is: &gt; &gt;rational, instrumental behavior and not a loss of control &gt; &gt;\u201congoing\u201d rather than episodic &gt; &gt;based on multiple tactics like violence, intimidation, degradation, isolation and control. &gt; &gt;Sixty to 80% of abused women experience coercive control beyond physical and emotional abuse. &gt; &gt;Men possess \u201cgender-based privilege\u201d because they are male. While all forms of abuse are about \u201cpower and control,\u201d women are vulnerable to coercive control because of unequal political status and because men can take advantage of pervasive sexual inequalities in ways women cannot. While control involves everything from survival resources like money, to what television shows women watch, male abusers exploit and regulate women\u2019s sexuality (e.g., how they dress, wear their hair, make love, etc.) and how they perform traditional gender roles as housewives and mothers. &gt; &gt;Coercive control is a violation of \u201crights and liberties\u201d protected by the US Constitution and international human rights conventions, including right to physical security (violence); to live without fear (intimidation); to dignity and respect (degradation); to social intercourse (isolation) and to autonomy, liberty and personhood (control). Over time, victimization and dependence are replaced by domination/subordination, agency and resistance. Emphasis shifts from what men do to women to what they keep women from doing. &gt; &gt;**Q: What should advocates know?** &gt; &gt;**A:** Advocates must \u201clook beyond violence,\u201d develop a proactive and ongoing response to the persistent nature of coercive control, emphasize the level of entrapment and control in assessing future risk, document and respond to the coercion and control in each case, adapt the political language of rights and liberties, and balance the restoration of freedom, autonomy and dignity with the provision of safety. &gt; &gt;Nonviolent tactics used in coercive control invade all arenas of women\u2019s activity. In response, advocacy must help restore autonomy wherever it is denied, by negotiating safe spaces at work, school or Church, identifying \u2018safe stops\u2019 where women can call for help, and organizing protective support networks. &gt; &gt;Although coercive control is more extensive than domestic violence, advocates can partner with women from a strengths perspective \u2013 what I term \u201ccontrol in the context of no control.\u201d Using the language of rights and liberties is key to helping women. It is also essential in getting police, courts and other providers to acknowledge how forcefully they would respond to someone who held a stranger hostage, or who tightly regulated how they dressed, walked, talked, spent their time or money, or how they made love under the threat of an \u201cor else\u201d proviso. &gt; &gt;**Q: How might the legal system better serve victims and hold abusers accountable?** &gt; &gt;**A:** When they confront the courts and ACS/CPS, victims feel they are on different planets. The criminal \u201cperpetrator\u201d is the \u201cgood enough father\u201d in Family Court cases or invisible to ACS/CPS. The same woman rewarded for pressing charges is punished for doing so in Family Court. ACS/CPS may prohibit her from contacting her partner while Family Court punishes her for denying him access. Advocates can help women and the courts understand how systems collude with the batterer and support his control and/or use of the children. &gt; &gt;Domestic violence laws focus on and respond to individual incidents according to the level of physical harm. Consequently, coercive control, where frequent low-level violence is accompanied by the other tactics, has no legal standing. Few elements of coercive control are currently considered criminal, or are only crimes when committed against strangers. &gt; &gt;Coercive control is rooted in the battered women\u2019s movement; the abuse of individual women harms and impacts women\u2019s standing in society. However often women may abuse male or female partners, women are rarely able to deprive men of basic resources, or to rape or degrade them sexually, regulate their enactment of gender roles, or systemically isolate them from the supports needed for autonomy. &gt; &gt;This Q&amp;A is taken from the [NYS Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence, OPDV Bulletin, Spring 2013.](http://www.opdv.ny.gov/public_awareness/bulletins/spring2013/spring2013_bulletin.pdf) &amp;#x200B;<wubstep_cat>: Coercive control sounds interesting. At the same time however I\u2019m a little disturbed by how pro women anti man the article sounds. It almost completely disregards female abusers for some reason and a lot of the focus seems to be on women only despite how the abuse could be inflicted on and inflicted by either party.<hopingforabetterpast>: This is just another example of purposefully biased work supporting the same old agenda everyone is now increasingly aware of. Fortunately, the general public's filter to this king of BS has matured enough that the first comment on an article like this is denouncing it. Unfortunately, it makes me and many others completely discard a priori the validity of studies about otherwise serious and meritorious issues.<LivingDeadInside>: &gt;Men possess \u201cgender-based privilege\u201d because they are male. While all forms of abuse are about \u201cpower and control,\u201d women are vulnerable to coercive control because of unequal political status and because men can take advantage of pervasive sexual inequalities in ways women cannot.

True altruism.<RareKazDewMelon>: Look, I know it's not that big of a deal, but it's pretty hard (not nearly impossible, just hard) to claim a moral high ground while helping someone break a law<mightyqueef>: It isn't about any moral high ground. I just don't see the principle of it. When giving someone a tip, I cannot comprehend why you would be adamant that the government take a slice. You may as well lower the tip in cash, and give the difference to charity. Either way, the tip you are giving to your server is diminished. It just seems like a fuck you to the server for no reason (assuming that the server hadn't been planning to declare the tip in the first place). So who walks around with that attitude? Where does that sense of obligation come from to make sure that someone with a base pay of 8$ an hour isn't trying to enjoy a fuller percentage of the tip you gave them? The whole idea drips with resentment. <RareKazDewMelon>: Because taxation is the backbone of the economy. They are supposed to be reporting tips and paying taxes like everyone else, so that everyone gets taxed more fairly. If there's just a huge portion of workers not paying income taxes on the majority of their income, it fucks up the numbers. Maybe you think tax money is wasted so you want to stick it to the US gov, but that's a completely different argument.<mightyqueef>: So this guy is doing it for the good of the country..... Sorry, but I just don't believe that.<RareKazDewMelon>: I mean that's the fundamental argument, but I didn't know we were at a point where we got into arguments about whether or not we should commit petty tax evasion. People should stop at stop signs, avoid smoking in enclosed public spaces, and pay taxes. Shit just works better if people follow a set of common rules. Why should waiters get a tax exemption just because they get paid a bit differently?<mightyqueef>: So should I flag officers down when I see a Jay walker?<Tehsymbolpi>: If you tip, regardless of in cash or on a credit card, the person you're tipping *should* report the income. This means that for any law abiding person receiving the tips it doesn't matter because they still report the tip and pay taxes on the tip. They'll make the same amount of money either way.<mightyqueef>: I've said my piece, and of course I understand how taxation works. Tell me you don't understand the point I'm making.

I had this happen to me some time ago. I lost my wallet on the side of the road and got a call from the police some months later to tell me some road workers found it and turned it in. <joshecf>: I am dealing with this right now. I found a wallet on the road but it is from a person from another country. I will just take it to the station but what about all the money in it? What if he never comes to get it from the police station? There is a decent amount of money in it.<swatlord>: That is a tough one. Do you know what country? There might be an embassy you could drop it to. <joshecf>: That\u2019s something I hadn\u2019t considered! I still feel like the police would be best though. No passport in the wallet. <swatlord>: Not a bad start. Please keep me in mind; I\u2019d like to know the outcome. <joshecf>: Copying from another reply So I took the wallet to the police station but I took the cash out since it was a lot of cash and I didn't necessarily trust the cops (call me jaded). I did however leave a note in the wallet basically saying \"I found your wallet and if the cops find you then call me and I will give you your cash\". When I dropped it off the cops didn't let me give them my info in case the guy turned up so I am glad I left the note. 10min later I get a call from the police station saying that they had seen my note and that I needed to drop off the money as soon as possible (I found it funny they wouldn't take my info down but as soon as they knew that there was money, they were quick to get involved). I told them I was at work but I would do it as soon as I got the chance. After that conversation, I kid you not, I got THREE missed calls from the cops in the span of an hour until I was able to get back to them and they were like \"when are you going to drop off the money\"? after I had already told them I would do it as soon as I could. I asked if the guy had shown up and they said no but it was improper for me to hold on to the cash in case he showed up. I said that I was at work and would take the money as soon as I could. Finally I got another call about an hour later from the police station but this time it was the guy that had lost his wallet. We arranged a time for me to give him his money back but the cop got on the phone was like \"if you would have left the money then you would have made everything a lot easier for everyone\". I know that it might have not been the right thing to keep the money but I was just putting it in the only place I fully trust, with me. The cops were treating me like a criminal even though I BROUGHT the wallet to them in the first place. If I would have just dropped off the wallet with all the money then the guy would have picked it up and never been able to know who did it and I would have never known that the guy finally got his wallet back. If it would have happened to me then I would have wanted to have the persons info in order to at least say thank you. Anyways, I just needed to vent for the way I was treated for trying to do the right thing. The guy ended up giving me $50 which was really nice of him.<memphoyles>: You did the right thing, but I don't blame the cops for this if that was the note you wrote haha, you sounded shady there and they probably thought you were going to keep it or even try something with the tourist, hence the many calls. I'm no way saying what you did is wrong, quite the contrary actually because we know the full story you are telling, but try looking through the cops perspective.<joshecf>: I know, I don't necessary blame them but I could have just taken the cash and they would have had no idea.

Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) work on behalf of insurance providers and earn money based on how much they are able to reduce the price of a drug for the consumer... Pharmaceutical companies have earned plenty of blame and anger because of the way they have come to treat good health as not a right, but a reward for wealth. It should be known that they are not the only ones to blame. In the process of how drug prices are determined, the pharmaceutical company individually determines what the price of a drug should be. This is, obviously, where the initial stage of greed comes from. PBMs, which are behemoth third-party companies around the US, are employed by different health plans (insurance providers, Medicare, etc). Their job is to make deals with the drug companies to push certain medications or generic brands, negotiate large contracts to only buy one type of medicine from that one drug company, and manage distribution of the drugs amongst pharmacies. They also determine which drugs are covered by different insurance plans, process claims from consumers and pharmacies, offer rebates for consumers and pharmacies, and make sure the drugs are properly taken by patients. Additionally, many of them run drug delivery companies, (think about those companies who offer to deliver your medication via mail for a discounted price). These companies gain revenue based on how much of a discount they are able to offer the insurance companies and health plan providers. It would seem, this would encourage them to keep prices low for the consumers, but it actually creates an economy for extremely overpriced drugs that can be sold in bulk for a huge discount. For example, a name brand medication might cost $100 per pill. The same drug company may offer a generic at $10 a pill. If the PBM can encourage the insurance company to only cover the $10 generic, they can get a contract with the drug company to only provide their one kind of generic, thus forcing demand for that product. On top of all this, PBMs do not release how much they save the consumer on drug prices because it is considered an \"***industry secret***.\" All in all, this information may not be helpful in your day-to-day life, but I think it\u2019s at least important to know.

Beef is probably the most delicious of meats. I really like beef. I cook a mean steak. I've made beef wellington, red wine braised short ribs, korean BBQ beef, dry-aged steaks, 1/2lb pub burgers, (perfectly medium rare in the middle), surf &amp; turf, 24-hour slow-smoked brisket (sweet jesus it was good)... you name it. Beef was always my go-to. Beef is the best meat. But I recently had to face up to the fact that it's the worst meat for the environment. Cows create the most climate-change-causing emissions of any common farm animal. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/heres-how-much-giving-up-beef-helps--or-doesnt-help--the-planet/2017/07/20/03bb5ba2-6d60-11e7-b9e2-2056e768a7e5\\_story.html?utm\\_term=.ad62ffade048](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/heres-how-much-giving-up-beef-helps--or-doesnt-help--the-planet/2017/07/20/03bb5ba2-6d60-11e7-b9e2-2056e768a7e5_story.html?utm_term=.ad62ffade048) According to this study, if you ate rice instead of beef once a week for a year, you would save 326 kilos of carbon. Chicken / Pork save 266 and 270 respectively - a large fraction of that 320. This is also taking into account methane for its effect on climate change and counting it as an equivalent amount of carbon. Cows release a lot of methane (lol yes farts) and it's enough to severely impact the climate. You don't need to radically change your life to start steering in the right direction. Make chicken or pork your default option when picking out your protein, or get the veggie option once in a while. Yes, there are bigger and better changes we could (and will probably need to) make to save the planet. But all you need to do to get started is ask for chicken instead of steak at Chipotle. I for one can live with that. From now on beef is only for special occasions, and I'll try and get beef that was raised by grazing.<4077>: I would like to point out that intensive pork farms are terrible for the local environment. However, an intensive chicken farm is no where near as destructive to it's local environment and their waste is used for fertilizer. Pig waste is pumped into ponds and left to fester and leach into local watersheds. The smell is often equally as pollutive.<ancient_scroll>: Yeah pig waste is no joke and raising pigs for slaughter is arguably more cruel. But if you are primarily concerned with climate change, either one is an improvement. <4077>: I'm against any intensive farming, but it is not a reality. So I just want to promote something more attainable and see where that leads. <iamsexybutt>: Lentils, peanuts, beans, peas, etc etc<4077>: A reality for some, but the general public isn't going to eliminate meats.<e-flex>: At the current price levels, no.<throwaway164579>: What do you mean? Vegetarian diet is way cheaper. Unless you mean meat is still artificially affordable enough for people to eat <wibblett>: I think he means that at the current prices people would still choose meat over vegetarian alternatives. I bought a pack of pork chops for $12 at Costco the other day. <buddha_punk>: For that same $12 you could buy a couple pounds of rice, and beans and still have money for some veggies and fruits. <wibblett>: I also buy rice and beans though and veggies. I love sticky rice with broccoli and asparagus. I also eat BBQ beans from time to time. <buddha_punk>: My point is that it is more affordable to eat without causing harm to others and also better for your own health as well as the environment. The pork chops are 100% unnecessary. <wibblett>: They are necessary to me though and clearly it's affordable. My wife made chicken teriyaki last night with white rice and vegetables. When you buy at bulk from places like Costco it becomes very affordable. Chicken is healthy too. I'm actually trying a low carb diet right now and have already lost 10lbs. Also drinking water only helped my health a lot. With the occasional coffee of course. <buddha_punk>: In what way is it necessary? Also a serving of chicken contains just as much cholesterol as a serving of red meat. Chicken, fish, and eggs being \"healthy\" is just a myth perpetuated and shoved down our throats by the industries that profit off of us thinking that. It may be affordable for you, but eating whole foods, plant based is still the most affordable option, healthier, and causes the least amount of harm. <wibblett>: They are necessary to **me** because I enjoy them. I've tried the imitations and they don't cut it for me. <buddha_punk>: You enjoying something does not make it necessary. There are people who enjoy smoking crack, but it isn't a human necessity. Is pleasing your taste buds worth more than a life? <wibblett>: Yes <buddha_punk>: Okay, let's apply that same logic elsewhere. Do you think people who abuse dogs or cats are justified in doing so if they get some sort of enjoyment from it? <wibblett>: No <buddha_punk>: Okay, so then why is it not okay to harm a cat or dog, but it is completely okay to harm a pig?<wibblett>: I don't eat cats or dogs<buddha_punk>: So if the only justification you have for killing a pig is the taste, then morally it is no different than someone beating a dog because they enjoy whatever pleasure they get from it. Both are completely unnecesssary, and both are completely cruel. You said abusing a dog or cat is not justified, yet your actions say something completely different. Eating animals directly supports animal cruelty on a massive scale due to a sensory pleasure and nothing more. A pig is no less deserving of a good life than a dog, cat, or we are.<wibblett>: I don't think eating pork supports animal cruelty. I'm not in favor of animal cruelty of any kind. <buddha_punk>: If you are against animal cruelty then I encourage you to look into where our food comes from. Factory farms and slaughterhouses are nothing but cruel. There are even documentaries on the subject, like Earthlings, Dominion, Land of Hope and Glory. If you don\"t want to watch a full doc, a quick search for \"slaughterhouse footage\" or \"factory farm footage\" will show you plenty of examples. If reading is more your thing, check out \"Slaughterhouse\" by Gail Eisnitz and also \"Eating Animals\" by Jonathan Safran Foer. There is a ton of information and documentation out there, widely available, showing how this is nothing less than extreme animal cruelty. And the majority of us support it, at least three times a day. The animals are treated horribly, then killed at an insanely young age. Just like a dog, a cat, you, and me these animals want to live. They don't deserve to be treated like objects then killed because we think they taste good. Purchasing these products directly supports the cruelty.<wibblett>: Thank you I'll give it a look. I can't promise anything though. <buddha_punk>: Thank you for being open minded enough to hear me out and look into it. No promises needed, I just think everybody deserves to know about this, because a lot of us don't. I didn't until Feb. Started dong tons of research and now here I am. Before then I ate bacon cheese burgers damn near daily. If you ever have any questions, or want more resources feel free to message me.

Why you need to know this? So you can turn anti-vaxers efforts on tuna instead and save countless vulnerable lives in the process. EDIT So this turned into a really great discussion. Thank you guys so much for the great info and many, many laughs. Suffice to say it's been a good day. I was asked for a bit of a summary for the latecomers so I'll give it my best shot based on the questions and answers given here. First and foremost: eating tuna with moderation is A-OK! Tuna salad does not cause autism just like mercury doesn't cause autism. There are, however, recommendations regarding intake that everyone should be aware of. If you are pregnant, are nursing, have young children (under 5) or have a compromised immune system, talk to your doctor. <https>://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/metals/ucm351781.htm There are different types of mercury with different properties. Ethylmercury a byproduct of vaccine componant thimerosal. It can be toxic if inhaled in, you guessed it, toxic amounts. Methylmercury is highly toxic when ingested too often, is absorbed in the digestive tract and is found in fish like Albacore tuna and many other species of fish and shellfish. Your weight has an impact on how toxic a dose can be.<https>://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Mercury_FactSheet.html Thimerosal is a component of vaccines that breaks down into ethylmercury (eg non-toxic) that is barely used today. Overall, mercury is not used in vaccines. Thimerosal is mainly used as an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agent.<https>://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/patient-ed/conversations/downloads/vacsafe-thimerosal-color-office.pdf The claim that mercury in thimerosal caused autism is false and came from Andrew Wakefield. His paper was retracted due to faulty methodology and he was disbarred as a doctor (and yes, that is apparently the right way to describe a doctor getting stripped of his medical licence).<https>://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/ For the real nerds, here is the original paper:<https>://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673697110960/fulltext Some people here played with the mercury from thermometers as children and now seem to collectively be waiting to die. If you are/were one of those children, you can breathe easy. It doesn't really go through your skin.<https>://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3514464/ Toxic methylmercury accumulated in food chains and is not supposed to be at such high levels in porpoises, fish and shellfish. We've made a mess of the place.<https>://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197220 Also, randomly, here's a link to the brainchild of a 16 year old now spending his days cleaning up the oceans.<https>://www.theoceancleanup.com/ The main point I was trying to make is that you need to follow the logic. I don't hate tuna, I don't want you to hate it either. It's really amazing how many of you dove in and started researching for yourself. We need more of you in the world. And to all of you claiming I need to cite my sources, you are entirely correct. The burden of evidence lies with the claimant. I hope this appeases you. (source: me) Also Jim Halpert is a smug bastard.<https>://www.reddit.com And all of you artistically inspired me to do this...<https>://www.redbubble.com/people/say-something/works/35843731-save-tuna?asc=u&amp;ref=recent-owner <netramz>: Does this mean eating a lot of tuna is potentially dangerous and I should avoid it, or is the risk negligible but greater than that of vaccines and it would be cool to focus on the ocean instead of letting kids die?<FIR3W0RKS>: Interesting question, I actually had to research an answer for this one. You would have to consume a considerable amount of tuna in order to accumulate the required dosage of mercury. The way mercury works is that it is biomagnified through the food chain, so animals lower on the food chain will have small amounts, but ones higher (ie sharks etc) will have much higher levels of methylmercury, maybe 10/20 times as much. Therefore the currently recommended amounts to eat of each fish are: for fish lower on the food chain (krill, Pollock, oysters, salmon) you can eat as much as you like due to their very low mercury content. Canned tuna or trout should be eaten up to a few times a week, and bigger fish such as shark, pike or halibut should only be eaten a few times a month. Excessive eating of bigger fish will result in minamata disease, which is essentially severe mercury poisoning of the brain. <MisterOkay>: Since human considered to be top of a food chain. Is it safe to eat human?<FIR3W0RKS>: Technically speaking no, for multiple reasons. However from a mercury poisoning perspective, unless you're eating their brains or kidneys, then you should be totally fine since that's where it builds up in humans<Sabnitron>: You've piqued my curiosity.

Even non holiday it's the same freaking songs every few hours every day. There are literally thousands of other songs. Sorry for rant/off topic<pmjm>: Radio guy here! They do extensive testing and focus groups year after year. Generally they are what's called Auditorium Tests, where they play the choruses of particular songs and the audience shares their reaction to them. In short, the songs that get the best reactions make it on the radio. Better reactions lead to the song getting played more often. In the last few years radio has also been tapping into streaming data, predominantly through the iHeartRadio app but they also buy data from Spotify, etc. The songs that get streamed the most get played on the radio the most. Those who complain about it are the vocal minority. Everybody else is content with the same songs over and over again. Especially for the holidays, where familiarity brings comfort.<Funkula>: Who selects what songs play in the Auditorium Tests? It's all payola bullshit that caters to the lowest common denominator. I wouldn't for a second believe these tests are unbiased in anyway. They just need their preferred record labels to put out music just bland and inoffensive enough to prevent people from switching off. If the this minority was so inconsquential then platforms like Spotify and SoundCloud wouldn't be so popular.<pmjm>: The auditorium test songs are generally selected by the program director and music director. These days that position tends to be held by the same person. You test primarily recurrents (songs that are ~6 months old) and golds (older songs) to determine how you prioritize their playback, or if you should even play them at all. Occasionally you test currents (if you're in a current-based format - for example an oldies station would never test a current), but those you basically are testing a black-or-white play-or-don't status on those. Spotify and SoundCloud are popular because you instantly hear what you want, when you want, and there are no commercials (assuming you pay for it). It's instant gratification, something that radio can not compete with. The days of payola are gone. Radio has been under such scrutiny by the federal government and the FCC over the last few decades that they couldn't get away with that anymore. Where they do make compromises is things like artist access. By playing an artist that is friendly to the radio station or corporation, they help make that artist a star while ensuring that artist will happily perform at the station's summer concert, where the radio station makes a huge amount of revenue. As for Christmas music, there's a station here in Los Angeles that's known for flipping to all Christmas called KOST 103.5. They usually flip to Christmas around the second week of November, and they are the prime example of Christmas radio in the country. Yes, they play the same stale 100-song Christmas playlist year after year, but what's staggering is that they DOMINATE in the ratings for the winter book. I mean, it's not even close. The second place station is generally 30-40% below KOST in the ratings when they flip to Christmas (for the rest of the year the margins are usually around 5% between 1st and 2nd). It's seriously mindblowing how well they do playing the same old songs. So we can question the methodology all we want, but at the end of the day it's highly effective and makes them the market leader for the Christmas season.<ancepsinfans>: Thanks for the detailed response! I\u2019m not OP, but I have a question. Wouldn\u2019t it make sense that KOST kills it in the ratings because stores and fast-/semifast-food places switch to them blindly because it\u2019s the holiday season? I ask because I used to work at one such place (a deli) and the GM insisted that people liked it. What he didn\u2019t know was that on Saturdays when he was off work, we would change the station back to something else equally inoffensive, and the customers actually *thanked* us for providing them with a quiet island of peace away from the Christmas songs. Point being that ratings don\u2019t necessarily equal desire.<pmjm>: These days that is true, because exposure to a station automatically counts towards ratings. Today we use a method called People Meter to measure what stations are being listened to. Randomly selected people carry around a device that basically works like the Shazam app in that it tells you what stations you're listening to by measuring an inaudible signal encoded into the station. In the past, however, ratings were diary based. Meaning when you were selected to participate in the survey you were required to write down what you listened to when, and for how long. This method was wildly inaccurate in terms of recording, and radio stations tended to do better when they made themselves memorable. That's why you had station jingles and slogans like \"KISS FM is my vacation station!\" and \"MEGA brings you the Phrase That Pays\" in order to win stuff. With BOTH of these ratings methods the Christmas format is insanely successful. As I mentioned in another comment though, the format has a quick burnout factor if you're exposed to it too long (as retail employees often are, and those of us who actually WORK at these stations just want to shoot ourselves by late December).

It doesn't have any algorithms to target spam/suspicious accounts. It just tags Reddit accounts from subs the developers disagree with politically, by scanning those subs for a list of users. It's garbage software.<TistedLogic>: It tags users who are a part of openly racist/homophobic/etc subs. Not just \"subs op disagrees with\"<Spaceguy5>: Yes because obviously all conservative leaning people are racist homophobes. Even the POC/gay ones. \ud83d\ude0f It targets conservative subs. Yeah there's some actual bigoted subs on their list. But there's a lot more included just because they lean conservative. Whereas the developers of it are actual communists. And don't include violent communist subs. Even rightwinglgbt is included on their list. I'm sure that sub is fullllll of homophobes.<PM_ME_WEIRD_SMILES>: Not to argue that all conservatives are racist/bigoted/whatever but being a thing doesn't stop you from hating that thing. Black people can hate black people. Gay people can hate gay people. Or hell they can even hate cross ways like black people hating gay people or gay people hating black people. <TistedLogic>: Yes, it's true than not ***all*** conservatives are racist/bigoted, but there is a far larger portion of them who *are* than on the liberal side.<garfield-1-2323>: That's a completely baseless assertion.<TistedLogic>: No. No, its not. Get your head out of your own ass.<garfield-1-2323>: Yes. Yes it is. Get your own head out of your own ass.<TistedLogic>: Good to know conservatives are as full of themselves as they racist. You've made that much clear.<garfield-1-2323>: Way to use \"b-but you're racist\" two times in a row without any sort of facts or basis in reality. It must be nice living in fantasyland where anyone who disagrees with you is a \"racist.\" You're such a joke.<TistedLogic>: Oh, like that? I never once said you were racist. I said &gt;there is a larger percentage of racists who are conservative than liberal. I shouldn't have to source that information. It's pretty common knowledge. The fact you're trying to twist what I've said is patently amusing. And ***I'm*** the joke? NelsonLaugh.jpg<garfield-1-2323>: It's not \"pretty common knowledge,\" and the fact you can't back up your claim after being called out twice is pathetic. But yeah, ok pal. Keep quoting cartoons at me.<TistedLogic>: The fact you haven't done any research showing that *conservatives* are openly racist is amusing and hilarious. Just look at the attack ads conservatives put out. Always about fear and hate of \"the other\". Liberals, on the other hand, have simply used the words and actions of conservatives against them. So, for example, Conservatives FOUGHT AGAINST: Independence Slavery Women's Suffrage Civil Rights It was *conservatives* who tried to repeal every good thing this country has tried to do. Most recently, the ACA/\"ObamaCare\" (which was just a modified version of Mitt Romney's plan. So, please, continue living in a fantasy of idiocy. I can do this for days. <Edit>: seems Reddit agrees with my position and not yours, so... NelsonLaugh.jpg (again)<garfield-1-2323>: Yeah the first place I'd look at is political propaganda. You have no clue of actual historical facts, don't you? DEMOCRATS fought against: preserving the union, ending slavery, women's suffrage, and civil rights. CONSERVATIVES fought for: preserving the unoin, ending slavery, women's suffrage, civil rights, ending the disaster called \"Obamacare\". Live your own fantasy land. Do it for days, I don't really care at all. Fool.<TistedLogic>: &gt;DEMOCRATS fought against: preserving the union, ending slavery, women's suffrage, and civil rights. This ignores the political shit in the 60s. It's also why I used \"***conservative/liberal***\". Democrats, for the longest time, were the party of conservatives. That changed during the Civil Rights Movement. And no, conservatives fought AGAINST all of that. REPUBLICANS (who, at the time we're the party of liberals) fought for the end of slavery. Saying anything else is just patently untrue. But please, continue this narrative. It just shows how fucking ignorant you actually are..<garfield-1-2323>: There it is, the old \"muh parties switched\" line. Go read a book. And you STILL haven't backed up your original claim. If you're going to continue baldly asserting stuff this idiotic, you need to back it up, otherwise you're just blowing hot air for no reason.<TistedLogic>: &gt;There it is, the old \"muh parties switched\" line. Yup, because it's true. Historical record in fact. Why don't ***you*** go do some actually historical research before you start with me on this. But since you've obviously given up on reality I am done dealing with your insanity. Please, before you respond, do some research into history. Preferably before you hurt yourself. I'll point out not once have I used the term Democrat. I have consistently used liberal/conservative because those are the ideologies. Democrat/Republican are party titles, not ideologies. So, for you to claim \"Democrat\" as a ideology is patently absurd. Lastly, sice you have given up on reality, no proof will ever convince you of anything, which is why I haven't bothered. You'd just claim fake news or just generally disbelieve reality.<garfield-1-2323>: Sorry, but you can't just create \"alternative facts\" by baldly declaring them. I see you still haven't read a book. Maybe you can catch a historical cartoon on PBS kids instead, since that might be more your level. Your party/ideology dichotomy is idiotic, and you clearly haven't considered that the definition of \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" have changed just as much as \"democrat\" and \"republican\" over the centuries, meaning that you can't just retreat into the safe space of those terms. So, not only have you shown a fundamental misunderestimation of history, you've done the same for language itself. Good job. Now, because I know your ego needs it, I'll let you get the last word.<TistedLogic>: I see you've still given up on reality. I don't have a misunderstanding of anything. I don't claim \"alternative facts\" which simply tells me that you won't accept any source I would give you so.. what's the point? You're not debating in good faith. You haven't from the start. I'm sorry the public school system failed you so badly you argue against reality.", "num_messages": 22, "avg_score": 621.9090909091}

Some have emailed but most have called in my experience. <houndi>: Can't you just call back? That's what I'd do. If an employer called me, they'd probably send a text and email as well if I couldn't answer. I'd much rather get stuff in writing rather than having to listen to a voice message over and over anyway. I haven't left a voicemail since the 90s, and I can't even remember when I heard someone have one. It's been dead here for a while.<Japjer>: What? What employer is texting you? Voicemails are solid methods for communicating in a business environment, especially if you have a number but no email. Texting a client is wildly unprofessional. Not trying to be a dick here, but it sounds like you've never really had a professional job. <houndi>: &gt;What? What employer is texting you? Any, since 90s when people got cellphones. Even oldschool conservative ones have done that since like 2000 at latest. &gt;Voicemails are solid methods for communicating in a business environment, especially if you have a number but no email. Over here they're a crappy method, since most of the time people or businesses don't have voicemails anymore. &gt;Texting a client is wildly unprofessional Why? I can't understand why a communication method itself is considered unprofessional somewhere, that sounds absurd to me. If you write a text in a professional manner, how is it different from any other written communication? Then again, downvoting all the responses to your comments is pretty unprofessional...<Japjer>: I've applied for dozens, if not over 100, jobs and I've never once had a potential employer text me. My current boss does, but I've been working with him for years and I don't mind. Where do you live that no one has a voice mail? I work at an MSP and contact clients, literally, from Manhattan to China. I've left voicemails across the globe, and my clients have responded to each and every one to some effect. Because you're limited to a small character count and broken message chains. You also don't have a guarantee that the recipient has a text plan or wants to text. Professional courtesy is a call or an email. That's just how it is, like someone somewhen decided that collars are required for men. Downvoting what? <houndi>: &gt;I've applied for dozens, if not over 100, jobs and I've never once had a potential employer text me. You've applied to a hundred jobs in Finland? See, I don't understand how your experiences in the States are relevant. We already established that apparently in the States the employers don't text, and that in here they do. Unless your job hunt happened over here, your anecdote is completely irrelevant as a rebuttal to my earlier comment. &gt;I've left voicemails across the globe, and my clients have responded to each and every one to some effect. I bet they have. Because the ones you've left voicemails have obviously had voicemails, so they obviously check their voicemail. Over here many people or companies don't use voicemails. That's literally what I've been trying to say throughout this conversation. &gt;Because you're limited to a small character count and broken message chains. Do you live in the past? You can send as long a text as you like. SMSs are automatically broken into 160 character chunks and stitched back together in the other end. That has been standard since 1990s. I've literally never experienced a broken message chain either. If that possibility is a serious reason to avoid that technology, you definitely shouldn't touch email or any other digital technology either. &gt;You also don't have a guarantee that the recipient has a text plan or wants to text. So you guys can't receive texts to your cellphones at all? That's absurd. As for their willingness to text, you don't need to know that. They're obviously going to call you back, you just text them your reason for calling and possible other necessary details. &gt;Professional courtesy is a call or an email. That's what you start with, yes. If they don't answer the call and you don't have an email, you send a text. As there probably isn't a voicemail.
