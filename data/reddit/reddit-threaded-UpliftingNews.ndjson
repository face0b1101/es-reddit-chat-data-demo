Would you rather they just never did anything but take your money?<Slappants>: I wish corporations did a bit more with their tax breaks and profits, especially those \u201cTriple Bottom Line\u201d companies, but this is an important sentiment to remember. <magicishappening>: Patagonia just announced that they are donating their $10 million tax break they received from the recent tax cuts to environmental groups fighting climate change. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/29/patagonia-10-million-tax-break-could-help-save-the-planet--and-set-an-example.html <Bells_Ringing>: As a conservative, I'd view this as a success story. They know where they'd like to use their money and elected to put it into environmental causes. That's exactly how we'd hope this works. My family will be giving more to charities this year that are local and immediately impactful ijy area as a result of the tax law changes. <DHPNC>: except this is an exceptional story. most companies that aren\u2019t run by Yvon Chouinard will use this money to compensate the CEO more or do something besides charity. when there\u2019s no incentive to do good only the very very good people will do it.<Bells_Ringing>: Frankly those are valid options as well. I'll likely buy a Patagonia jacket this month versus a different brand because of it, also using some of the tax savings. Is that bad as well? That's me selfishly using some of the windfall in a non-charitable manner. <DHPNC>: exactly. Holding up Patagonia as a model of why the tax windfall is good and charity deductions, etc. are bad is stupid because they are one example in a sea of shitty examples.<Bells_Ringing>: I don't follow. I will keep more of my money this year due to the savings. If I buy something I want with it, I'm doing what the bad companies do, which is bonuses or raises. If I give to charity, I'm good because I'm like Patagonia. Either way, I get to do what I want with the money. Is that not a good thing intrinsically? And if Patagonia were truly philanthropic minded with no ulterior motive, they would not have revealed the charitible gift, which is giving them far more than 10 million in free advertising. Again, I don't care what they do with it.<SenorBirdman>: Yeah I doubt it is worth the price of what you can buy for $10m in advertising. Citation needed. And no, the whole crux of the disagreement is that other people think that is not intrinsically good. That's the point. Companies should be taxed so the money can be put to good use in a way that has been determined as beneficial for society as a whole by people whose job it is to make those informed decisions, rather than letting the companies spend the money on whatever they want and hoping that some might choose to do some good with it. You seem to fundamentally disagree with and/or not understand the point of tax.<Bells_Ringing>: Perhaps you are the one who doesn't understand what taxes are for? Taxes are to find government services, such as roads, military, post office, and other essential services. All taxes are paid by people, either as personal income taxes or through higher prices for goods and services in the form of corporate taxes. Tax revenue is the highest in our history this year. If the reduced rates are unacceptable, what is a fair rate that everyone should pay? Also? Those informed decisions on spending are policy decisions.

Here's a stat for you doc, the likelihood that a sixth grader in Baltimore City Public Schools will graduate with a college degree within 6 years of graduating high school (if they do and even 2-year AA degrees counts in this stat), is ~4%. The government in Baltimore and to an extent Maryland largely controls the means of producing educated people there, why not put them in control of many other things? <StockDealer>: &gt; Here's a stat for you doc, the likelihood that a sixth grader in Baltimore City Public Schools will graduate with a college degree within 6 years of graduating high school (if they do and even 2-year AA degrees counts in this stat), is ~4%. I haven't seen the stat you're referring to, but let me interject with \"no, you're almost certainly misunderstanding this statistic.\" Here's some (non-cherry picked) stats for you: https://www.towncharts.com/Maryland/Education/Baltimore-city-MD-Education-data.html<UWantWhatUGet>: American Community Survey? Why not use the actual data from the State? Additionally, you cannot compare the number of people with college degrees in the City to the number of people that went to City Schools and got a college degree. The people in the ACS in B'more who are doctors and lawyers and business pros are largely not BCPSD grads, they are imports from other areas. <StockDealer>: No, it's not my job to discredit your obviously on its face erroneous statistic. If you cite it then I can look at how you are both misunderstanding it, and cherry picking it.<UWantWhatUGet>: [The consortium also](https://www.baltimoresun.com/bs-md-ci-college-completion-report-20110907-story.html) found that only 5.8 percent of those who started at a two-year college earned a degree in six years compared with 34 percent of those at four-year-colleges. The report \u2014 the most comprehensive look to date at college acceptance and completion trends for city school graduates \u2014 used data from the class of 2004, tracking degree completion through 2010. Start with 5800 sixth graders, about 75% graduate, so you're at 4350. 47% of those, 2044, go to college. 50% go to 2-yr schools and 5.8% graduate - that's 60 kids and 50% go to 4-yrs and 34% of those, 348 graduate - so 408 out of 5800 get a degree - so 7% - oops, I misspoke. Keep believing 75% or w/e they tell you. <StockDealer>: So about half go on to college. It's right there in your document. If you want you could help with this by increasing taxes to pay for these things, as many other countries successfully do. But I suspect it's not the poverty and cost of education that you want to focus on with your grossly misleading statistics.<UWantWhatUGet>: 7% graduate within 6 years. That is not grossly misleading, that is the fact. &gt;about half go on to college Of that 1/2, only 20% graduate in 6 years (and that includes the 1/2 of that 1/2 that go to 2-yr schools. &gt; you could help with this by increasing taxes to pay for these things Any qualified kid from that district gets to go to college for free, are you kidding - colleges are dying for qualified minority kids. Did you know that in Baltimore, if you are a qualified (like barely minimally qualified) BCPSD graduate, you can get a free ride to Johns Hopkins? Really. Not many do of course because after $16,000/yr/student education, only about 10% are even close to qualified. 1/2 the kids are not proficient in anything...literally. Public education is the biggest boondoggle going, especially in urban districts where it is effectively day care. Spend more money - what a crock. Money doesn't buy you shit in education, except votes. Look at the KCMO school district and the $2B they got - only metric that went up was drop-out rate. Zuckerberg got sucked into corey booker's scheme to get Newark kids $200M - he lost $100M as the money was \"squandered\" and you still wouldn't send your kid to Newark schools if you had to. There are plenty of other instances as well. Ever wonder why your local school board never touts the successes of their kids after the previous bond initiative victory when they advertise the next one? because there is no advancement. Putting more dumb kids in college is the most insane idea ever, and the left laps it up like it will do something without ever doing the research - they simply want more money to scam from productive people to buy the votes of the unproductive. Unbelievable. Stats PhD tries to tell us that 75% or some GROSSLY MISLEADING number of Baltimore City Schools' kids get degrees. Suckers. <StockDealer>: &gt; Any qualified kid from that district gets to go to college for free, are you kidding - colleges are dying for qualified minority kids. You're now arguing with the same article you just cited which states that it is clearly the financial burden which is preventing higher graduation rates. Do you want me to cite your article that you just posted or not?<UWantWhatUGet>: The devil's in the details. \"qualified\" matters. Nearly 2/3rds of the graduates are not proficient at 'grade-level.' Grade level is basically can read and write in complete sentences and maybe form a decent paragraph and knows a bit of algebra. Those kids don't know that stuff. 25% of all 4-year college course across the US are remedial level. These kids aren't even qualified for that. They get their grants and fed funding, then they do terrible and lose the funding because they are not qualified. They don't leave because they cannot afford it, they leave because the people that were paying for them no longer will. Regardless, you're at 7%. Quit pretending that we are missing out on the cancer curer or the next Newton. People aren't pets, quit treating them like they are and maybe they'll stop acting like they are owed everything in life.<StockDealer>: You just keep gish galloping all over the fucking place. I blame the school system for your inability to follow even your own citations.<UWantWhatUGet>: give me money...i'll learn better<StockDealer>: No, you literally haven't even read the report that you're trying to barf out. There's no way to learn if you don't actually read the real numbers, rather than some bullshit hate that you're trying to prop up. The numbers are 40% and 11% and were increasing in 2013, as is stated in the report. Plus this is city-only. But let's be honest, you're not interested in that. You're literally using 2 year schools, which have a track record of ripping people off and also going out of business, the ones that exploit the poor, to slam people who are literally on FARM assistance. That's a dick move. I notice you don't say \"Hey, 40% are graduating from four year schools, not including non-city enrollees and those that complete later!\" Let me ask you this to illustrate how little you researched about this: what's the last number in table three of the actual report? This number is important. <UWantWhatUGet>: 40% are not graduating from 4-yr colleges. Only 47% (of graduates - don't forget to back out the dropouts, too, so that number is much less) enroll at all, half go 4-year and half 2-yr. 2008 - 535 graduate 4-yr and 62 from 2-yr within 6-years; out of about 5800 kids 2009- 565 &amp; 84 2010 - 520 &amp; 89 [Here ya go.](https://imgur.com/a/GhjczjK) I do not care if the are FARM kids or not. And we are talking Baltimore City for a reason. It is an entirely dysfunctional waste of money. [source](https://baltimore-berc.org/college-fact-book/) - link goes to pdf <StockDealer>: Oh, you're switching to 2017 now? And the BERC fact book rather than the original reports? Okay -- you're a big moving blob but sure. Good googling! Now you're actually sort of reading what you're writing about. That's an improvement. You don't care if there are FARM kids or not? That's another dick move. Poor kids are much less likely to be able to graduate, as the report states. And the reason we're even discussing Baltimore is because you cherry picked it in the hopes that it would reinforce you. Because you call that thinking. Firstly, yes, the numbers will change when you google a different year. Secondly, you don't seem to be understanding that these numbers are all not all graduates of all programs everywhere. These are students who stayed in the city to complete their degree or diploma. Thirdly, as before, you forget that the two year \"schools\" such as ITT tech and shitty, horrible offensive and disgusting criminal schools like \"Trump University\" fed off of and exploited the poor. Fourthly you don't seem to realize that these city schools include \"charter schools.\" Now, if you're interested in comparing how it does, let's compare it against, say, one of the shithole states in the middle of the country. Would you like to pick Texas, Alabama or Mississippi?<UWantWhatUGet>: No, I'm not switching to another year. That report shows the years i was discussing from the beginning. The entire reason we're looking at 2017 data is because we need the 6+ year college activity of the 2010 HS grad class. You have nothing of substance to offer. You are flailing about trying to invoke racism and Trump U. Come back when you have some real data and intelligent analysis - you'll need to cite those because clearly you aren't bringing it. I picked one of the 24 districts in one of the most highly rated public school systems in the nation. If you want to dumpster dive, go right ahead. Public schools everywhere, except for a very very few cloistered districts are a scam. time for you to bring something to prove it otherwise.<StockDealer>: Okay, let's recap what you discussed in the beginning since you've forgotten: &gt; Here's a stat for you doc, the likelihood that a sixth grader in Baltimore City Public Schools [wrong] will graduate with a college degree [wrong] within 6 years of graduating high school (if they do and even 2-year AA degrees counts in this stat [wrong]), is ~4%. [wrong] You only got the \"six\" right. And now you're trying to draw a line between \"highly rated\" school systems and graduation rates [wrong]-- while you blow off poverty rates which are the more critical predictive variable. Was your goal to prove that libertarian \"philosophy\" is fucking moronic? <UWantWhatUGet>: What are you talking about? &gt; likelihood that a sixth grader in Baltimore City Public Schools [wrong] (RIGHT) How can that be wrong? I made the premise. &gt; will graduate with a college degree [wrong] (AGAIN, RIGHT) Again, I made the premise. &gt; within 6 years of graduating high school (if they do and even 2-year AA degrees counts in this stat [wrong]) (RIGHT) Are you even reading? The data is right there in the chart and further in source. ALL COLLEGE DEGREES - 2-yr or 4-yr. &gt; is ~4%. [wrong] (Wrong) The number is 7% - whoopty fucking do. &gt; And now you're trying to draw a line between \"highly rated\" school systems and graduation rates [wrong] No I did not. This has always been about Baltimore City Public Schools. &gt; while you blow off poverty rates which are the more critical predictive variable. Poverty rates are correlative with poor education success - of course it is, most poor people are below average in IQ and poor parenting. I showed you that pouring money into a school system does not benefit the students, you ignore that because it doesn't fit your pre-ill-conceived guess as to what makes kids successful in school. You have offered no support for any of your assertions because you know you are simply making shit up or regurgitating what some hustler told you to think. congratulations on joining a long and getting longer list of people that think they know what they are talking about here who then get schooled because they have no support or ability to refute anything i have said.", "num_messages": 24, "avg_score": 8.3333333333}

Where does the waste go when the rocket fails or explodes? It also takes a _lot_ of energy to get to the sun - you've got to cancel all of Earth's orbital velocity, as well as adding whatever extra speed to make the travel time shorter.

From here, the debate is likely to shift away from whether or not electricity will be decarbonized. It is about when and how fast this will happen, as well as what resources will be included. The world is changing. Fast. <szegedin74>: The last thing I want to do is burst this bubble, but... In the next 100 years or so, the majority of population growth will be in Africa and the Middle East. These societies -- developing would be the nice way to characterize their economies -- will continue to use fossil fuels, because the price of the fuels will plummet, the fuels will still be there, and those fuels will have a tremendous value to them. Why won't they use renewables and electric cars? They won't have the dough for that infrastructure development -- it costs billions and billions. There will be millions of used internal combustion cars kicking around. They will get used. The developed world will not be able to stop 400 million Nigerians from pumping their own dinosaur juice into your old Volkswagen. Have fun, millennials! I plan on checking out by then.<hashcheckin>: they're just as likely to leapfrog the fossil-fuels stage. Myanmar and parts of India, for example, went from zero phones to smartphones without an intermediary step. as these new developing areas become industralized and modernized, they aren't going to go straight to the old, polluting tech; they're going to buy up the new, shiny stuff that gets sold to them on the cheap by companies that move into their markets specifically *because* there's no preexisting infrastructure. as we've seen already, China in particular is willing to take a hit early on in order to be the tech sugar daddy to a developing world. what you're more likely to see is a sudden influx of those Africans and Middle Easterners with better phones than you, powered by 3D-printed solar cells, calling your descendants dicks on Reddit because of Gulf War II.<szegedin74>: Well, hope springs eternal, I guess. There are several economic things in play: The \"new shiny\" stuff will always have a certain price. China is not handing out free candy, they are laying crippling debt traps for developing nations. It will be up to their elites whether their sovereignty gets sold for some solar panels and a windmill. Another factor is that, contrary to what some people think, there is no such thing as \"how much energy the world needs.\" Human beings will always consume all the resources available. Moreover, monopolies will develop (ie, Google owns all the power generation sources) so renewable won't necessarily be \"cheap\" like it is today. People will always consume all the resources there are, so nobody is going to leave oil sitting in the ground unless you prevent them at gunpoint. Then there will be a dispute about it. That's the direction I expect things will go. Just as people have always chopped down trees -- all of them -- they still do in places where people are very poor. Nigeria can produce oil at $20/barrel. The world is going to have a lot more poor people (proportionally) in 50 years, and this is not at all about consumption, it's about production. Color me skeptical on the tech solutionism.<hashcheckin>: it's not so much my faith in tech as my noticing recent history. you give a developing nation solar panels and cell phones, and they don't need infrastructure. it might be debt traps, sure, but those aren't environmental and a lot can change as the situation develops. don't get me wrong. I don't think that we can put our faith in just magically innovating our way out of the jam we're in. I do think that expecting a consumption-based carbon bomb to go off in India is short-sighted, particularly as the situation degenerates, given what we've seen in similar scenarios in the very recent past.<szegedin74>: I wish I could share your optimism. You can see my age in my username. What will drive the direction of developing nation's carbon footprints is their economic production, not their consumption. Look at China's appalling emissions, and India's, and then look at Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and all of Africa and the Middle East. The will be burning coal and petroleum. In order to produce economic value. Cell phones are a total non issue. People scoff at Luddites like \"oh, you guys would have said steam engines were a bad idea!\" Weren't they? Everything we've done up to now as a species has been part and parcel of the environmental catastrophe that we are in. That trend line is not changing. <hashcheckin>: you aren't that much older than I am. the cell phones are an analogue, not an actual part of the issue. as new energy technologies emerge, there's not going to be as much reason for widespread fossil-fuel adoption, particularly in developing areas. it's just a question of generating, keeping, and continuing the momentum towards that development. I'm honestly not that optimistic, but the alternative is drinking myself to death.<szegedin74>: Look global emissions are rising not falling. The fact that Germany is getting greener has everything to do with India having higher emissions. There's only one system. This is going to sound a little bit dark, but my outlook is that people have to accept the end of the human species just like they have to accept their own end. It is inevitable and nothing to worry about. And a beer along the way is not a bad idea. Cheers!<hashcheckin>: nah. assuming that the species is inevitably going to go extinct from this is basically the same thing as denialism; it's a way to avoid having to do anything to deal with the problem. we have options. they aren't necessarily fun ones, and the next decades are going to be spectacularly \"interesting\" no matter what, but pessimism as a justification for inaction isn't any more logical than optimism as a coping mechanism.

The studies being done point to kratom being an exciting new prospect for safe pain relief, opiate withdrawal, alcohol sobriety, anxiety, depression, and plenty more. Tens of thousands have now used kratom successfully. Anecdotal reports are so frequent now, it's becoming a statistical certainty that kratom is repairing communities and opposing opiates. Literally every person in the community is anti-opiates. It's vastly better than the alternative. It has real side effects, but that's almost exclusively when someone is taking much higher doses than they should be. These include constipation, runny nose, nausea, etc. This actually highlights one of the best aspects of kratom: if you take too much, you'll get sick and throw it up. It's not glamorous, but it's absolutely amazing how self-regulating it is. This deters most of the people trying to abuse it and makes it impossible for someone to overdose on it alone. The FDA has \"linked\" 50 or so deaths to kratom, but this is a total smear campaign. Every single one of those people had several other drugs in their system. Fentanyl, heroin, oxys, and just about every other srug under the sun was found in high amounts in yhese people's systems. One of the \"linked deaths\" is a guy who shot himself. Another is a guy who jumped off a a bridge. It's truly beyond absurd how hard the FDA is fighting kratom and the misinformation they've been peddling to the media. They're really worried it will be the next big thing and they're right. Lucky break for the 70,000 people who are going to die next year if they can't find something to manage their pain/opiate addiction. Kratom is a safe, coffee-family plant, that has minimal side effects, a ridiculously high ld50 (6-10lbs), and is coming out of the literal woodworks when it's needed the most. Addiction to kratom has not been shown in trials. Physical dependance takes consistent heavy use for many months.

Only the non Muslims get gender equality because Muslims don't want gender equality. What is with Muslims and they're hatred of women?<willmaster123>: Its a bit more confusing than hatred. Women are not merely just individuals, they are apart of a family unit and are basically only seen as mothers and wives, and that is it. In this conservative society, women have to be protected at all costs, covered up with cloths to prevent men from attacking them, provided for and given a home and money to spend, they are not allowed to work or do anything too strenuous. In their view, they are pampering and protecting women, in our view, they are giving them zero choice in their life, which is considered worse. A big factor also is that under islamic law, a man HAS to spend their money on women and children, whereas a woman can spend money on themselves. Its a lot more confusing than just 'ahah we hate women lets make their lives awful'. In their eyes, they think they are doing *good* for women. And this isn't unique to Islam. This is how 95% of the world was before liberal values gradually spread across the world. <Roguelo>: &gt; A big factor also is that under islamic law, a man HAS to spend their money on women and children uh huh And what happens if they don't? Mind sharing an example of a court case where a man is prosecuted for buying a nice car or vacation to Dubai?<willmaster123>: No lmao I dont think you understand. They don't have to spend ALL their money, but they do have to provide as much as possible for them, and its considered against islam to not be as providing as possible. You can divorce your husband if he doesn't provide for you, not only financially. Although of course, that isn't always the reality, but it is technically sharia law. you can still spend money on yourself. But you have to be the main provider for your wife. Even if she works and sustains herself, you still are obligated to pay for her stuff. <Roguelo>: &gt; they do have to provide as much as possible for them right. And so if a man spends money on a personal vacation or a nice watch, then he's not providing \"as much as possible for them\". If this is an actual law, then link to *literally one court case* where a man was prosecuted for it &gt;Although of course, that isn't always the reality, but it is technically sharia law lol well good thing Muslim women aren't constrained by reality then Nothing to see here folks! Black people theoretically had the right to vote in 1865, so there was no reason to criticize American laws regarding race back then!<willmaster123>: I dont really know where I would find a SPECIFIC court case for that. I tried googling \"islam divorce for not providing enough\" and all that came up was about the UK. In most countries, islamic or not, if the sole breadwinner of the family is not giving any money to the other members, that is grounds for divorce. If you are earning money while your wife has nothing, that is grounds for divorce on her part. But specifically in Islam they have pretty strict laws, both societal and legal, about men providing for their wives. Its considered very, very bad for a man to have money and have a wife who doesn't see a lot of that money. In general, money spending is the wifes duty, although this varies country to country a bit. Similarly, its considered bad for a religious man to be buying luxury cars and going on crazy vacations as you said. That is more the secular arabs in the gulf states, not the hyper religious crowd. Also nobody is saying \"nothing to see here\". People are just talking about the laws surrounding this stuff, not supporting it. Calm down. <Roguelo>: &gt; In most countries, islamic or not, if the sole breadwinner of the family is not giving any money to the other members, that is grounds for divorce In all good countries women can get a divorce for *any* reason they want, because they're not property<willmaster123>: okay strawman. Once again, we are not arguing morality, or whether these are good or bad countries. Nobody is bringing that stuff up except for you. All I am saying is that in islamic law a man is required to do as much as possible to keep their wives financially happy. Nothing more and nothing less. Stop putting some crazy agenda into everything here. <Roguelo>: You: &gt;In their eyes, they think they are doing good for women. Also you: &gt; we are not arguing morality, or whether these are good or bad countries So Sharia law is fine because Muslims think they're doing good, but when I point out that they're objectively misogynistic suddenly morality is irrelevant Nice!<willmaster123>: Notice how I said 'in their eyes'. If you ever talk to muslims about this stuff they will use every excuse in the book about how their laws and religion actually helps women and all that. Its not actually good for women. I even pointed that out in the next sentence. Nobody said that its good for women, at all. Nobody said 'sharia law is fine'. You're making strawmans out of nothing. <Roguelo>: &gt; Nobody said that its good for women, at all Muslims do. They say it all the time. And you're defending that reasoning with this \"it's the law!\" nonsense<willmaster123>: Oh my god nowhere at all did I defend it, at all. Literally all I did was explain the basics of it and how Muslims justify it. I can\u2019t tell if your retarded or being purposefully obtuse. You seem like the type of person who couldn\u2019t handle a class about WW2 without yelling about how the professor is justifying nazism. <Roguelo>: &gt;You see, what the Nazis did they did for the sake of their own people. They even had laws against murder and other bad things! Yeah, I'd consider that a defense of Nazism<willmaster123>: \"You see, what Muslims did they did for the sake of their own people.\" Where did I say this, or anything remotely close to this? Explaining how islam treats men and women in terms finance is the same as saying Islam is good and all that to you somehow? I seriously have never seen a strawman this ridiculous. <Roguelo>: &gt;In their eyes, they think they are doing good for women. <willmaster123>: Yes, in THEY'RE eyes. Just like how the Soviets thought, in their view, they were doing good for the poor people of Russia. That doesn't mean they actually were doing good.

It was dead of winter, snow on the ground, and I stopped by my in-law's place and opened my door. This little emaciated black lab jumped into the car and into my lap, freaking me out. The in-laws came outside and told us the story of the dog: They had seen her running around the hills and trees for a couple months, because the people across the street from them owned her but stopped taking care of her. My in-law's were kind of upset at the dog because she would eat out of the trash and was eating snow to stay hydrated. She was a fully grown lab, but couldn't have been more than 20 pounds-her ribs were poking out and she just looked terrible. My wife marched right up to that house and told them we were taking their dog, and they could either be fine with it or we'd call the dog warden and request he give us the dog since clearly they were incapable of taking care of her. We took her home that night and she wandered through the house scaring our cats, found our bed, jumped right up on it and fell asleep on my pillow. She's the best dog I've ever had, literally everything I have ever wanted. Sometimes dogs select people and I think that it's beautiful. <mayhempk1>: That is so sweet, I love it.<PookAndPie>: lol thanks. She's a real cutie.

What are you even going on about?<k1rage>: im just going to agree to disagree there Id take any of the big threes full size trucks over a tundra but I respect your opinion <BasedCavScout>: Not really an opinion. Truck quality isn't subjective, which is why there are industry standards - all of which Toyota pretty much leads in. The Hilux is one of the strongest trucks in the world, just as an example. Just because you prefer one brand over another doesn't make you right. You're certainly entitled to purchase whatever product you want, but having the opinion that inferior trucks are superior is categorically wrong.<k1rage>: well I guess we will just have to agree to disagree <4thetrees133333>: That's not how being objectively wrong works you idiot. It's like talking to a child.<k1rage>: you are the one name calling but im the child? ive do nothing to you but you attack me because our truck preferences differ? I think ill just wish you good day sir <4thetrees133333>: If idiot is name calling to you I suggest you put the video games down, get off reddit and participate in the real world. Yeah I'm being an ass but frankly types like you need to have your bullshit shut down. OPINIONS ARE NOT FACTS and fucks like you are why this world is devolving into childish bullshit. <k1rage>: you seem angry im just burn time at work like the rest of us good day sir <4thetrees133333>: So you're a slacker ass well. Gotcha. Forever alone seems about right. <k1rage>: why do you feel the need to attack me? <4thetrees133333>: Why do you feel the need to spout opinion as fact with no substance to your comment to even back up that opinion. Why do you feel the need to shit on something positive just because you're bored at work. Fucks like you need to be called out, that's why!<k1rage>: all I said was that I preferred other trucks over Toyota you were the one that jumped on me for liking a different truck live and let live bro <4thetrees133333>: No you didn't. You initial post was clearly a dig at Toyota, there was nothing about your preference, it was obviously meant to be edgy but you just come across like a child. Fuck it theres no getting through to cavemen like you, spend some time examine why you felt the need to be negative on a positive post and maybe your relationship issues might start to figure themselves out. Fuck not even sure why I bother. <k1rage>: it was a dig but it was never meant to be interpreted as a statement of fact, it was an opinion. you disagreed and then went to personal attacks which seem to be your bread and butter, lets leave my personal life out of it shall we? I have refrained from attacking you all I ask is the same courtesy good day sir <4thetrees133333>: You dont understand how English works. It was written as a statement of fact. N yup if I've got to attack a slacking low life idiot to get across to others that opinions aren't fact and just having an opinion doesn't make it valid then yes I will. Fuck you're an incel aren't you. The good day and faux calm superiority just scream s it. <k1rage>: all I did was state what trucks I preferred why do you care so much and why do you keep attacking me instead of just saying you piece you dont need to throw insults around, its kinda rude <4thetrees133333>: No you implied toyotas were crap. Your first post says nothing about preference so stop teying to change what you initially said. We live in a world on the fucking brink and people like you are the ones dumbing down our collective narrative. You were shown how you were objectively wrong by another poster pointing out Toyota leads the packs on all metrics used to rate trucks and you just say agree to disagree. That's not how being objectively wrong works and people like you need to wake up to that so as a fucking society we can find a way forward. Is your preference of truck the be all end all, no of course it's not but I'm going to bet you're the same with many other topics having equally wrong opinions. Which as I've said. Is not valid. <k1rage>: if I say toyotas are crap thats my opinion am I not entitled to that? I was never shown to be objectively wrong, no one ever linked anything proving what truck was better, you just told me I was wrong there was never an outside source just let it go dude, mellow out (oot if your happen to be Canadian) its ok for people to disagree <4thetrees133333>: Yup you would be wrong, and again your opinion is not valid, not everyone's opinion matters, parents dont set school curriculums for a reason, we have judges in courtrooms even with a jury for a reason and the idea that every person opinion is valid is utter bullshit. <k1rage>: so its not ok to like one truck more than another do well all have to drive the consensus best truck? <4thetrees133333>: It's perfectly okay to like one more than the other, but it doesn't make it valid, and if you cant even give reasons as to why then dont muddy the public discord. More people need to take time and think, do I need to post this. The answer is almost always NO<k1rage>: well I can post whatever I like so long as its within the rules of the given sub, I try to be polite and have a little fun thats all. <4thetrees133333>: Yeah you can, but maybe you and alot of others shouldnt. As a society we might actually be able to have rational discussions and fix things in this world if people like you who think their opinions matter will shut up and let people who know what they are talking about figure things out. I'm guessing you're also canadian since you brought it up, well how about you dont contribute to the americanization of our discourse eh. <k1rage>: I'll continue to do as I see fit, however thanking for leaving out the personal attacks in your last couple messages, they really didn't contribute much.", "num_messages": 30, "avg_score": 984.6}

But the US can not enforce what Iran does with its own money and part of our bargain was to un-freeze their assets. I can only assume some of this money may go to funding terrorism on Iran\u2019s part, as that is what Iran does.

I don't understand why you have so much Animus against Saudi Arabia, but are all pro-Iran... Because that's how it reads. But I'll forget that. I appreciate your admission that giving that money (unfreezing funds... Freezing funds is what you do to terrorists) to Iran is essentially the same as funding Terror. What I don't agree with is that it was a binary choice... Either give the terrorists money so they, among other things, can fund killing you (well not you, because you don't got the brass to go yourself, you're an English Major...that one I'm willing to bet is over your head). Or you can risk Iran continuing their work on a nuclear weapon (even though they continued regardless) and just do nothing to stop them. It wasn't diplomacy, it was about domestic politics. Do you want to talk about how Obama foreign policy was behind the Liyba uprising, followed by Syria, leading to the rise of ISIS, and thus the loss in millions of lives and even more displaced? I mean, you want to be intellectually honest, right?<Roosebumps>: Then you\u2019re reading it wrong.

As was the 4th deadliest earthquake in human history. Then two up: &gt;How was there a fire after the earthquake? Then the one you responded to: &gt;Poor building materials, plastics and rubbish that are common in built up semi-slum areas in the developing world, couple with poor emergency services. They were comparing the two earthquakes, and discussing how the building standards of Alaska compared to Haiti is what made the difference between no casualties and the fourth deadliest in human history. Then thru discussed the fire after the Haiti earthquake as an aside, before suggesting that the better fire prevention methods, better fire codes, and better emergency services of Alaska were a huge factor toward preventing said casualties. They were very much in the right conversation, and everything said was relevant to their discussion; I think you just accidentally got off the track of the chain of comments you were responding to.<King_opi23>: No, they got off the wrong track, he was trying to respond to the wiki comment about the Lisbon disaster, but instead mashed two separate threads into one and it made no sense. <Ulairi>: Lisbon was never mentioned in this chain. Antioch was mentioned, which also had a fire; but it was ambiguous if the commentor asking specifically about *that* fire, about what causes fires following earthquakes in general, or about the fires in Haiti following it's 2010 earthquake; which was also mentioned above. The comment you responded to chose to specifically address the general question, why they were more common in developing nations, including Haiti, and why they're less common here. Which, again, was perfectly relevant. You're the one who actually mashed a couple of threads together here, as the Lisbon disaster was an entirely separate chain of comments below the comment referencing the Antioch earthquake of 526. Like I said, I think you got off track somewhere along the way; everything they said made perfect sense in context. <King_opi23>: There was no mention of fire in the chain about Haiti. Im glad you think you're reading into this right a day after the convo, but you're not. The guy meant to respond to the comment which linked a wiki article, about a disaster and consequential fire. There is no mention of fire in the Haiti comment <Ulairi>: A day? The earliest post in this conversation was eight hours ago. The whole post is only nine hours old, and is still only sixth down on my front page. You can't know what the guy meant to respond to, but even if you did your response made no sense given the context. If you *actually* thought it was the Lisbon fire, then you'd have asked about the slums in Lisbon, not the slums in Alaska. That said, if he *was* asking about a wiki article linked, and the subsequent fire, it would have been the Antioch one he directly responded too, as I said above. That, or, *since the thread mentioned the death toll in Haiti*, a good number of which were a result of fires that broke out; it seems possible to think that, after being linked and article about the Antioch fire, and looking up the Haiti earthquake and the fires there too, he asked about fires following earthquakes in general. Which seems to be what the poster you responded too assumed. Something that even OP's comment about Lisbon seems to have addressed as well. Even if it still *isn't even in the chain your responding too.* I'm not sure why you've chosen to double down on this; your own original comment is even at odds with your entire argument since. You can be snarky all you like, but it doesn't make this argument any less stupid, or you any less incorrect. I was originally only trying to point out I think you were off thread at the start, *which you've since confirmed by suggesting the commentor was asking about a article actually linked in response to that commentor...* not turn this into a pissing match, but you do you man.

What you can handle right now will always change from day to day, so it is important to keep pushing forward.<forcedaspiration>: Hardwork is underrated. I blame our failing public educational system, where the teachers just collect a paycheck and follow their union overload's homogeneous mis-education plan. American kids and young adults are at a severe disadvantage to most 1st world country's kids who systems are better, so its not like the union overlords are right.. at all. They could easily allow teachers to put kids to work on projects like this, that build grit, and teach hard work can payoff. But they cant, thanks to the overlords, who resist any mention of paying teacher more for doing a great job, and firing those that dont care, you know merit? Its so fucked.<drot525>: LoL. Union overlords. LMAO. The teachers union as mentioned by someone else isn't setting the standards. That's your local or state school board, which is usually elected. And the fault with our education system begins and ends with the parents as both the primary educators of their children and voters for funding and school boards. But that's some shit that saying so ain't getting any politician elected. The teachers union is feckless and nearly worthless. Stop believing the propaganda that the only reason things are fucked up is because teachers are smart enough to collectively bargain. <forcedaspiration>: That, smart enough to collectively bargain, means they cant get fired. NOT OKAY in an organization that is responsible for educating our youth. It protects teachers, and should be protecting kids.<drot525>: It protects kids by protecting their teachers from being fired for arbitrary or capricious reasons. It allows teachers to push back against the myriad of shitty ideas some middle management puke or some nutty consultant has cooked up to extract wealth from our education system over and above teaching kids anything. Teachers can be fired. Just not arbitrarily. As long as the SD follow the procedure as per the contract they've signed, they can do it. The problem is their managerial incompetence that keeps them from following the procedure. Also, it's not the teachers as often is it's the administration of the school or the district or the \"brilliant\" ideas from revolutionaries like Gates or DeVos that are a bigger threat to the education of the kids. Many of these \"revolutionary\" ideas are untested, and not founded in reality before they're even applied. But sure, blame the lowest person on the totem pole.<forcedaspiration>: You are full of talking points, when the facts don't back them up. Fact. Private Schools provide better education for less money. Fact. Private schools can fire teachers if needed. Coincidence? Are you telling me that there aren't plenty of public school teacher that suck, you are wrong there, big time. I did public, private, and independent study when i was a kid. I can tell you public is a complete waste of time. They were talking about shit in high school that i learned in 4th at private.<drot525>: LoL. There's a super obvious selection bias at play with comparing private versus public. Take the easiest to educate kids, the best and brightest kids with the parents who are most active in the education of their kids, remove them from one pool and put them in the other pool, and you call that apples to apples? Those kids were going to do well in any case, because they have parents who give a shit and they're usually the most capable as well. Private schools and charter schools also aren't doing much for special ed or ESL kids. Charter schools also have this habit of taking kids up until the state pays them for the year, then booting them back to public school because they are taking up too many resources to teach. Keeping the money of course. All of this is a waaaaaay bigger factor than teacher unionization rates or teacher pay rates.<forcedaspiration>: Well, if it were up to me we wouldn't have ESL kids, that's just a jobs for teachers programs liberals came up with. Americans stopped having as many kids, then teachers got behind open borders. As far as special ed, they are a special segment and you are getting cute, there is a big problem with mental illness in this country, and teachers aren't helping thats for sure. Public School Sux, and needs to be completely reimagined. Including teacher accountability. You just like the status quo, but one day the people will revolt because all teachers like you do is make excuses for your inability to teach.

Keep money coming in. Cash flow is normally what kills businesses, not profit margin (or the lack of those things). 2. It gives them time to get renewables on their feet properly.

Don't forget, the directors are employees and shareholders are the owners of the business.<Yodaisawesome>: I don't think it's necessarily a huge risk. This world needs energy and concerns of using fossil fuels are clear. The only way these companies are going to maintain cash flow is if they *do* move to renewable energy. <Randomn355>: Right now it is, as the tech, the infrastructure, and the market hasn't been established yet fully.

I don't know if you believe that or not but it's a lie.<cuteman>: Hundreds of thousands of people gain citizenship every year. How do they succeed where others fail? People are absolutely doing it the right way. It just happens to be a lot easier to walk across the border and get paid under the table. <EspressoBlend>: ~400,000 worldwide. And yet ~400,000/y are still crossing the border. So you believe what exactly? ICE process all these people but they choose to risk death in the desert because... they dumb? So desperate to break the law they don't care how they do it? There are insufficient spaces allocated for legal immigration despite the demand from foreign people *and* the work they're finding here.<cuteman>: &gt;~400,000 worldwide. &gt; &gt;And yet ~400,000/y are still crossing the border. Could be a lot more legal immigrants if we didn't have so many illegal aliens to contend with. How many should we let in per year? &gt; &gt;So you believe what exactly? ICE process all these people but they choose to risk death in the desert because... they dumb? ICE largely handles the people that are caught and detained. They take the risk because the wages are that much better... 10/hour versus 10/day. At 8-12 hour days that is 1000-1200% better pay. That's quite an incentive. &gt;So desperate to break the law they don't care how they do it? Um yeah... It's been happening for decades. That's why tens of millions of formerly Mexican citizens now live in the US. &gt;There are insufficient spaces allocated for legal immigration despite the demand from foreign people *and* the work they're finding here. Demand from foreign people? That's doesn't determine our immigration levels. There is insufficient space because illegal immigration clogs the system. As I said above, we could easily accept more immigrants but not when the same number of people come over illegally. It's almost a million people per year combined legal and illegal. We use Walmarts because detention facilities were meant to house dozens or hundreds, not the thousands that come across. That's a signal that this is a huge problem. The United States cannot house and grant citizenship to the world's poor. <EspressoBlend>: Your whole post can be condenced to your final sentence, which is like the immigration version of the Laffer curve. True in theory, used to create shitty policy like internment camps.<cuteman>: My family is Jewish. Some died in the holocaust. People were pulled out of their homes by the millions, robbed, beaten, starved, tortured and killed. Compare that to hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens entering the US per year. Tens of thousands of which are unaccompanied children. Some have been deported before. Some have criminal histories. Most didn't expect to get caught. Some were assaulted on their journey. Some are being actively trafficked. The vast vast majority are economic migrants looking for 10/hr jobs instead of the 10/day in their home countries. We put house them in old Walmarts because regular detention centers are designed for dozens or hundreds, not thousands of people. It's such a huge problem but they are the ones actively choosing to take action that they know to be illegal. It's not Disneyland but it sure as shit isn't an internment camp. Any other ways you'd like to belittle the holocaust or nazi actions because your ignorance doesn't know any better? <EspressoBlend>: Being Jewish is not the great counter you imagined it to be when defending internment camps because everything you just said was said back then, too. The camps aren't that bad. Theynshouldnt be here. &lt;insert economic anxiety here&gt; And then it got worse because that's what internment camps do. We've been saying Trump is a repeat of Hitler. Winning with a minority of votes, the calls to jail opponents, abuse of power, disturbing divisive language, *camps*.... I mean how far does he need to go before people realize where they've gone? What if he makes the camps uncomfortable? Or expands their use? What if they become permanent to prevent reentry? I mean at what point do you stop going along with these incremental steps?<cuteman>: Being Jewish isn't supposed to be a counter. Only to highlight the ridiculousness of your strategy wherein you call everyone who disagrees with you a nazi. As you've probably been doing since the election. Hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens attempt to cross every year and have done so for decades. This isn't suddenly a Trump problem except in so far as the media has told people to be outraged. The reason they're housed in a Walmart? There are so many of them. But neither did we pull them out of their beds, beat, rob, starve, torture and kill them. They made a choice to come here knowing it was illegal. To compare it to the holocaust shows your ignorance to the realities of of the nazis. <drot525>: Being Jewish doesn't automatically inure you from becoming a Nazi or Nazi-like. Like any other human being you're as susceptible to being propagandized and led astray as any other person.<cuteman>: And yet, not in this case. I grew up in California, I know all too well the realities. Legal immigrants are fine, illegal aliens are not. Wait in line, pay your dues. Simple. <drot525>: Describe for me how the line is formed in other countries waiting to come to the US?<cuteman>: For starters you submit paperwork instead of coming across uninvited and unapproved. Visa, residency, citizenship, refugees, etc. it is all available just like it would be for you to go to another country.<drot525>: Im curious why you want to try to make non Americans comply with American laws, when it seems it would be way easier to make Americans comply with American laws by going after the people who hire illegal immigrants? <cuteman>: &gt;Im curious why you want to try to make non Americans comply with American laws, when it seems it would be way easier to make Americans comply with American laws by going after the people who hire illegal immigrants? por qu\u00e9 no ambos? Did you seriously just say why do we try to make non Americans comply with American laws? Because they're the ones who are choosing to come here when they know it's illegal. Are you suggesting they don't know it's illegal to do? If that's the case why would we want someone that stupid? <drot525>: They're not coming here to hangout. They're here to work. It would be a whole lot easier to prosecute the employers than the employees. You go apply without a visa in Australia and the company will snitch you out to their immigration service. <cuteman>: They're not coming just for work anymore. They're staying more and more. It's a massive bureaucratic nightmare and the choices are enforce the laws against fraud or allow an amnesty but we have a precedent for amnesty and nothing changed, infact it got worse. It incentivized people staying, thinking they'll eventually be made citizens. Where does it end? <drot525>: Bullshit. They're here to work. As shown by when the Great Recession hit net immigration was negative. Meaning with no work those Mexicans figured out it was cheaper to be an unemployed Mexican in Mexico than the US. <cuteman>: Is that why nearly ~20M formerly Mexican citizens now live in the US since the 1970s? <drot525>: It's pretty far to commute. Doesn't change the fact if we prosecuted the people who illegally hired them, the hiring would stop and they won't come or wouldn't have come. And the ones here would leave. Say you got a budget of 200M dollars to solve the problem you want to spend your time and resources chasing 12M illegal aliens or their 3M employers. It's like the 300, you chose your bttleground correctly and 300 men can hold off hundreds of thousands for a good long while. Shit this aint rocket science, you chose your battle ground correctly and choke points like employers seem easier and cheaper to defend than all of the US borders and ports. <cuteman>: We do go after companies that hire illegals. Why are you under the impression that we don't? Liberal celebrities just don't tweet about it and media doesn't really cover it. <drot525>: Sure we are. <cuteman>: It doesn't make leftist news but it definitely happens. In California especially, on the thousands of farms that are there. Can you show me evidence to where we aren't enforcing it? The problem is the sheer numbers of illegals. Border control tried to catch the hundreds of thousands that cross per year, but millions already exist. Many of them commit fraud with fake social security numbers trying to present legitimate identification. <drot525>: You can't prove things that don't happen. But there's circumstantial evidence that we haven't been enforcing the law against employers; tens of millions of illegal aliens working in America. So we might have these small programs that are there as a smoke screen or a red herring, but they're clearly inadequate. Probably purposefully so by the small govt suck big business cock GOP pricks. Just now in January ICE cracked down on some 7-11s. It was in the US News, so much for your liberal media doesn't cover it bullshit. You're missing my point; of course it's hard to accomplish the goal at the border since most illegal aliens fly in, which is why the right wing and the POTUS are idiots with the wall and border shit. You want to have a bunch of nitwits running around in the desert and building a boondoggle on the border meanwhile your average alien flew in on a visa and just never left. It's why you guys look like racist idiots even when you're not, because the only people at the border are the poorest of the poor and usually brown as well. You don't have to arrest 47 illegal aliens working at a farm; arrest the farmer, jail his ass, fine his ass. It's cheaper; you can tag and release those 47 will go home on their own eventually. Now if no one could hire them because they'd be afraid of paying through the nose or by facing jail time for doing so, then it would mostly stop. Absent a job the only pricks overstaying their visa or jumping the border would be ones with money being funded from overseas, and really no one is trying or wants to kick rich kids out or ones where money is coming INTO America. <cuteman>: &gt;You can't prove things that don't happen. But there's circumstantial evidence that we haven't been enforcing the law against employers; tens of millions of illegal aliens working in America. That's like saying we aren't enforcing the border because there are millions of illegals. Guess what? We try. ICE is woefully underfunded to handle it all. Notice we house people in Walmarts because the usual detention faculties house dozens or hundreds but we are dealing with thousands and thousand per month. &gt; &gt;So we might have these small programs that are there as a smoke screen or a red herring, but they're clearly inadequate. Probably purposefully so by the small govt suck big business cock GOP pricks. Just now in January ICE cracked down on some 7-11s.

You want to have a bunch of nitwits running around in the desert and building a boondoggle on the border meanwhile your average alien flew in on a visa and just never left. So from your perspective: it's difficult so let's not try? &gt;It's why you guys look like racist idiots even when you're not, because the only people at the border are the poorest of the poor and usually brown as well. Every country has immigration and border control. Try to walk into Mexico illegally and see what happens. (hint: you'll be sent to prison) It has nothing to do with color and everything to do with low wage, low skill people who do not want to pay dues or wait in line. &gt; &gt;You don't have to arrest 47 illegal aliens working at a farm; arrest the farmer, jail his ass, fine his ass. It's cheaper; you can tag and release those 47 will go home on their own eventually. Except most don't go home. They stay, and then bring over more family. &gt; &gt;Now if no one could hire them because they'd be afraid of paying through the nose or by facing jail time for doing so, then it would mostly stop. Absent a job the only pricks overstaying their visa or jumping the border would be ones with money being funded from overseas, and really no one is trying or wants to kick rich kids out or ones where money is coming INTO America. Again you act like we don't enforce the laws against employers, but there just isn't enough coverage to get them all. If there are millions and only a few thousand ICE agents how could we ever catch them all? Are you in favor of increased ICE funding? Nope. But of course you'll say that they aren't doing a good job despite woefully inadequate resources.<drot525>: &gt; You don't have to arrest 47 illegal aliens working at a farm; arrest the farmer, jail his ass, fine his ass. It's cheaper; you can tag and release those 47 will go home on their own eventually. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Except most don't go home. They stay, and then bring over more family. If they can't find work in the US, they'll go home. They stay because they find jobs. <cuteman>: And because there are so many you can't possibly police all employers. They are already supposed to verify citizenship but many illegals work in cash industries, recycle collection, landscaping, day labor, etc. <drot525>: Well clearly attacking the supply side of immigration isn't working, but by all means build some more internment camps and keep doing what we're doing. What could wrong by doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.<cuteman>: I wouldn't say it's doing nothing but the problem is millions of individuals strong. The government does enforce citizenship and immigration laws against employers. I'm not sure why you're suggesting otherwise. Do you think individual illegal aliens are being detained and held to standards that US companies aren't? Most illegal aliens are completely off the books. Unless you want to ban cash, not all of it is trackable until it goes digital and remittances ($50-60B/year) being sent back to Mexico. Hence the orignal plan of taxing US to Mexico remittances to pay for the wall. (orignal plan on the Trump campaign website)", "num_messages": 34, "avg_score": 1016.9411764706}

The bill defines hemp as an agricultural product for the first time and amends a major drug law that hadn\u2019t been altered in 50 years. <begemot90>: Sorry, I\u2019m going to be captain buzzkill. This bill actually makes it harder for individual farmers and easier for Monsanto and other megacorps. You know something\u2019s gotta stink when Mitch McConnell is happy about passing a bill with anything to do with cannabis<BadgerSilver>: Yeah, no. Just because rich people will make money, doesn't mean this is a bad decision. The real tragedy here is that it's being swept under the rug and discounted as anything but a huge step in the right direction. This was overwhelmingly supported by farmers and ranchers nationwide. I'm sure there are a few tag-alongs, but this was bipartisan 386-47 in the House and 87-13 in the Senate.<begemot90>: Gonna have to go ahead and disagree with you on that. There\u2019s $1 billion dollar is corporate give aways in this farm bill. This farm bill also subsidized the tariffs that Trump put in place. If you\u2019re only argument that it was a good piece of legislation is because farmers who would\u2019ve lost a lot of money other wise liked it, and a bunch of politicians who\u2019ve taken money from the agricultural industry liked it, then you should reevaluate how you judge legislation <BadgerSilver>: In fairness, I work in a very similar industry and work daily with those who use CBD as an integral part of their health plan. The greater good here is that millions are getting medication, I don't particularly care if the government had to spend a size-able amount to get there. This will save far more money than that within a couple years. It's the best investment this country has made in years. Funding for those tariff subsidies had to happen. You certainly can't add tariffs without subsidizing the correlating industries, that would end in millions of people losing their jobs. In politics you can't toss an entire bill for something that was negotiated in there. It's something or nothing every day. It's how the country functions.<begemot90>: I get that, and I agree that people having access to proper care is the way things should be. But why not just legalize and walk away from the issue? Why take out a billion dollars and give it to the rich? I would have a different view on things if the government was giving start up money to a bunch of scrappy hemp farmers, but instead it will go the mega farms. And you care about medication, and I totally agree, until these mega corporations start fucking with your formula to ensure they have a customer for life. Lastly, I do not want to be giving my tax payers to fund corporate welfare. It would seem to me that the last thing corporations need is even more of an edge over local growers.<BadgerSilver>: In a Democratic Republic, that's how things work. If you're arguing snippets of the bill. We can do that, but you can't just scrap the whole bill because of it. The bill is way more good than bad. If this isn't progress, I don't know what is. The corporations won't be fucking with the formula, it's a chemical compound. How absurd. The local grows voted for this!<begemot90>: Ok, how does being a Democratic Republic have anything to do with the bill process? But yea, let\u2019s talk the bill. Scrap the whole damn thing and try again. I live in a state that has CBD, and medical marijuana, and we got product without the government pumping in cash, so why do they \u201cneed\u201d money too? Why are we paying farmers because a president was warned this would happen? No, take it all fucking down, take that 1 billion in corporate giveaways and shove it. That\u2019s a big fucking bill to just say, \u201cthe the price we must pay if we want the crown to allow us to have hemp\u201d. Nope, sorry, not falling for it this time. Just legalize that shit and fucking forget it. <BadgerSilver>: No negotiation is the absolute worst way to communicate and live. This has been shown time and time again. Communist dictators don't negotiate, Kings don't negotiate. A Democratic Republic doesn't deal in extremes like this. If we choose your way and play it out it literally ends in a revolution. Wars. Humanity is flawed in a way that can't be fixed by demanding bills to be perfect. If you can devise a way to go from point A to point B without crashing the government, we'll have a discussion. Yes, they *should* have made that decision, but do we cancel the bill over it? No, because that's extreme and people aren't perfect. We don't stop voting because we don't like either opponent, but maybe those who think so shouldn't. We pick the best we can and hope to god it works. That's what humanity is. <begemot90>: I\u2019ll negotiate all day about what we should include in a farm bill This is a sweetheart bill for special interests. It does not create solutions but problems, and that\u2019s why the WHOLE bill should be scrapped. The problem is that your ascribing the inability to find common ground to common people, not the congressmen who hamstrung the citizens time after time <BadgerSilver>: That's why we vote for who is going to do the best job. That's the Democracy part. What you are proposing is beyond the ability of a normal elected official. If you are saying this in an attempt to get people to vote for people who share your values, then I get it. But you can't actually scrap the bill because, again, that ends in chaos any way you spin it. Anyway. I believe your intentions are good, but I don't think you really know what you are talking about.<begemot90>: Not at all What I\u2019m proposing is that congressmen stop accepting payments from special interests, that would work wonders. That\u2019s well within their ability. Just as it is to debate a bill rather than ramrodding it down \u201cin the dark of night\u201d as this article suggests. So you\u2019re ok with democracy being bought by special interests. You\u2019re ok when our democracy isn\u2019t transparent. And you\u2019re suggesting that as long as it satisfies some requirements then everyone must support it because democracy right? Seems like we have two different understandings to what democracy it, what I listed above isn\u2019t democracy, but an oligarchy masquerading as a democracy. So as my democratic choice to choose, I\u2019m going to continue to say this bill sucks, and should be shot down. <BadgerSilver>: No, that is not how a Democracy works. The people are already voting. If you didn't vote, please for the love of God stop sharing your political views. You seriously have no clue what you're talking about. You're getting caught in a complete paradigm of thinking. Elective officials voted for it, and we voted for them. But, to wind this down, it's necessary that there are some dissenters. <begemot90>: And I suppose it\u2019s necessary we have some sheep as well.<BadgerSilver>: Either way, we'll see ;)", "num_messages": 15, "avg_score": 23.6666666667}

Just because Cosmopolitan does it, doesn\u2019t make it okay.<Vagabondcam>: I'm more wow'd by your disgusting ignorance. <A_Wild_Raccoon>: Oh wow. I never realized the Oxford definition for racism was disgusting and ignorant. Go up to a minority and tell them they\u2019re stunning and brave for having a darker pigment in their skin.

See how they react to that blatant racism. Are you calling yourself racist? Second, that's not what's happening here. These 19 women ACHIEVED something by winning their races, despite the color of their skin. Black women could literally not vote in some states until the 1960's. I am a minority. I'm afraid I can't even begin to reason with you because you don't think in the slightest that 19 black women winning an election isn't an achievement.... Quite honestly dude, you're too far gone for any type of conversation. Promptly, go unfuck yourself. You're going to live this ragged life always being partisan, difficult to love and no matter what- you'll constantly be pointing the finger at other people. Your entire post history for the past **multiple hours** has been arguing with multiple different people, and you're hard lined in this thought process of yours. Don't you have a job? Don't you have something better to do? Friends? A girlfriend? Its just like, pathetic at a certain point<A_Wild_Raccoon>: I don\u2019t care if black women couldn\u2019t vote in 1960. This is 2018, and black women CAN vote. If they couldn\u2019t vote, I would advocate for them to be able to vote. Why is it wrong for me to not get emotional and caught up about the past? The Oxford definition states that being prejudiced towards a race means you\u2019re a racist. Saying that someone is brave or special for doing something while black is the bigotry of low expectations. It\u2019s a form of racism. I\u2019m not calling myself racist, I\u2019m calling the article racist. It prioritizes skin color over merit. But keep trying to insult my character, as if that\u2019s a valid argument and doesn\u2019t make you look void of the ability to debate. <FYI>: I\u2019m not partisan. I\u2019m a centrist who criticizes racism and bigotry on both sides. If you don\u2019t like that, too bad.<Vagabondcam>: you brigadier solely on posts that support the right. if you need to define the word racism to someone in hopes of pathetically displaying to them that you're not racist- chances are, you're racist. No, the article commends them for being historically disenfranchised individuals that were able to overcome social deficiencies and **achieve** something unprecedented. honestly, this/you are not worth me time. fuck off<A_Wild_Raccoon>: I believe the pendulum swung too far to the left. That\u2019s why. I don\u2019t need to define the word racism, but I want to make it clear I don\u2019t believe that racism = privilege + power. So you\u2019re wrong about that. I don\u2019t think you don\u2019t know what racism is, and I won\u2019t imply it because I\u2019m not an asshole. And my response to the article is that it\u2019s being pretty racist. If you don\u2019t like it, so be it. And since you started this by responding to me, and then had the gull to try and frame me as a racist, how about you fuck off?<Vagabondcam>: I\u2019m not framing anything friend, it\u2019s what your own words say about you. I didn\u2019t make you say those things. Moreover, you're wrong. you *seek* posts where you can defend the right. many of your comments are in subreddits devoted to attacking the right but you are there defending it. Being that you're a self proclaimed centrist, why have you not done that for those subreddits that deeply support the right?<A_Wild_Raccoon>: &gt;Are you calling yourself a racist? No, clearly not. How did you even manage to come up with that conclusion? &gt;you\u2019ll constantly be pointing the finger at other people Name one thing I\u2019m doing wrong and blaming other people for, in regards to this topic.<Vagabondcam>: you edited that post when i first commented on it ... damn dude, you're like off the wall man. you need a reality check it's really pronounces your pitifulness by constantly downvoting my posts.. while me and you are the only 2 people in this conversation...<A_Wild_Raccoon>: Sorry for posting too early I guess? I only downvote the ones you insult me in, because it\u2019s rude and uncalled for. <Edit>: And it doesn\u2019t contribute to the discussion. <Vagabondcam>: I guess i should downvote those that are condescending, unfortunately- im not as petty as you<A_Wild_Raccoon>: Are we going to devolve this conversation into the logic behind downvoting a single person, are you going to address my questions, or are you done?<Vagabondcam>: ive addressed your questions. you're too obtuse to be open to an actual conversation. you also blatantly ignored me addressing your weak \"centrist\" views. [Moreover, i guess this is just more racism to you too, huh? Or maybe not, because one of them is a republican.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/elections/native-americans-congress-haaland-davids.html) <edit>: [here's another racist one for you!](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2018/11/07/0200000000AEN20181107009300315.html)<A_Wild_Raccoon>: The questions in my editted reply I don\u2019t know enough about this to form an opinion. But I will say that highlighting her heritage and sexual orientation in her campaign as if it\u2019s important is weak and off-putting. I don\u2019t care what a person\u2019s heritage or orientation is, and I think minority-point-scoring is lazy. <Edit>: At least they included her name.<Vagabondcam>: as you continue to ignore my point about your \"centrist\" views. in the current (albeit slowly changing) and historical climate, white people have an advantage being born white in america. men have an advantage being born a man in america. is this news to you? it's comical to me how you go from calling another article, which is highlighting the same exact thing just a different race/party, racist but you can call this \"lazy\". selective bias. \"centrist\", right. get over yourself. <A_Wild_Raccoon>: And women have their own sets of advantages, etc, etc. White privilege is a deeply flawed argument. Every race and gender has sociatel pros and cons. This isn\u2019t news to me, it\u2019s just a flawed ideological talking point that I don\u2019t put up with anymore, assuming that\u2019s what you\u2019re implying. The reason I didn\u2019t call it out for being racist is because Natives have their own in-groups and protected communities, given this was originally their land. I don\u2019t know enough about it to form an opinion. I could care less if one of them is a republican. At the very least, at least it means there\u2019ll be more diverse opinions. But yeah, I\u2019m a centrist. More than not I lean right, but I still support left wing ideas. The reason it\u2019s hard to believe is because the mainstream left is becoming more and more extreme. A centrist to them, is a leftist.<Vagabondcam>: Dude, you **seek** extreme left wing ideas and debate them but you do nothing of the sort for extreme right wing ideas. In one post you speak of the 1960s like it\u2019s the distant past but in another speak the past with credence. You also didn\u2019t comment on the Korean American woman. I like how you mention things that solely support your headlined position. You\u2019re being obtuse to facts now. I\u2019m done with this conversation. Please leave it alone. You lost.<A_Wild_Raccoon>: Well that\u2019s the thing though. I don\u2019t have to seek them. I have them shoved in my face regularly, because I\u2019m interested in politics. The extreme left attacks people for their race, and it\u2019s socially acceptable. That pisses me off enough to be concerned about it. When right wing extremists are racist, mainstream conservatism criticizes it alongside the left. It\u2019s not the other way around. The mainstream left HIRES proud racists. Sorry if you don\u2019t think 50-60 years is a long time, but I do. A lot can change in that time. <FYI>: Please just drop the conversation. You lost.

And the fact that there are so many job openings means that employers have to compete to get employees and to keep the good ones that they already have, thus pushing wages higher. This is just Econ 101.<StevenGannJr>: &gt; Hourly wages in the US are currently at all-time highs. And all-time lows when adjusted for inflation. That's Econ 101.<andypro77>: &gt;And all-time lows when adjusted for inflation. That's Econ 101. Nope, that's Bullshit 101, because it's not at all factual. (Go ahead try to prove it) When you have to make up shit to try to make your point, it means that you don't really have a point, doesn't it? Making up fake statistics might work with the idiots you hang out with, but it doesn't fly when discussing things with people who have a little bit of intelligence. Do better next time so you won't embarrass yourself again. <StevenGannJr>: According to the [US Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/coverage.htm), the federal minimum wage in 1980 was $3.10/hour and today it is $7.25. Adjusting the 1980 $3.10 to 2018 real dollars using the handy [CPI Inflation Calculator from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm), the 1980 minimum wage equates to $20.33 in 2018 dollars, based on the metric of real buying power which includes an analysis of typical food, clothing, and housing available on the consumer market each year. You can repeat this same calculation for every year since the federal minimum wage was introduced in 1938, and if you graph the results you'll see that [minimum wage has been decreasing since 1968 when adjusted for inflation.](https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/anth484/minwage.jpg) Did your macroeconomics class fail to cover inflation, or do you just take the decontextualized metrics from Fox News as gospel? Denyong basic mathematics and reputable sources might work with the idiots you hang out with, but it doesn't fly with people with basic educations. Read a book so you won't embarrass yourself again.<KingCrow27>: Average hourly wages do not equal minimum wage. Newsflash: Not all workers are paid minimum wage. You can't just scrape the bottom of the barrel and then proclaim that it represent everyone. That's why average hourly wage is way more meaningful. Not everyone works at McDonald's. Your pretentiousness is embarrassing.<StevenGannJr>: Average income is an increasingly poor metric for representing the [growing divide between upper and lower economic classes](https://c6dl5x1uaua7tk6u-zippykid.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/US-before-tax-income-1-768x424.png). A small minority of high-earners doesn't raising the average doesn't accurately reflect the growing numbers of people who are outright destitute. Let's look at a nice, simple example. You've got 100 people. - 1 of them makes $100mil/year - 5 of them make $1mil/year each - 10 of them make $500k/year each - 30 of them make $80k/year each - The remaining 54 make $15k/year each What's the average wage? A whopping $1.13mil! Wow! This must be a very healthy economy where the average income it over $1mil! ...but when you look closer, you'll see somewhere between 50% and 80% of those people aren't making enough to make ends meet. Not everyone is a billionaire consultant. Your ignorance of reality is embarrassing. you'll understand better when you actually have to get a job and pay your own bills.<andypro77>: &gt;**Average income is an increasingly poor metric** for representing the growing divide between upper and lower economic classes. **A small minority of high-earners** doesn't raising the average doesn't accurately reflect the growing numbers of people who are outright destitute. Well, it's a good thing that when calculating US Hourly Wages, the Bureau of Labor Statistics **DOES NOT INCLUDE any of those people you use in your example**. It's simply hourly employees, and doesn't even include supervisors. &gt; Let's look at a nice, simple example....not everyone is a billionaire consultant Once again, you'd have to use a fake example to make your point, because **THOSE IN YOUR EXAMPLE ARE NOT THE SAME AS THOSE THE BLS USES TO CALCUATE HOURLY WAGES.** &gt; Your ignorance of reality is embarrassing. Oh, the delicious irony of YOU making this statement. I'm torn here. While it's sad that you're so stupid, it's becoming increasingly hilarious each time you post your idiocy and further embarrass yourself with your lack of knowledge. On balance I'd say keep it up, because I'm mostly enjoying throwing actual real facts at your made up little fake stories. &amp;#x200B;<StevenGannJr>: &gt; Well, it's a good thing that when calculating US Hourly Wages, the Bureau of Labor Statistics DOES NOT INCLUDE any of those people you use in your example. It's simply hourly employees, and doesn't even include supervisors. Unfortunately, the BLS _does include_ everyone who reports income each year. &gt;Once again, you'd have to use a fake example to make your point, because THOSE IN YOUR EXAMPLE ARE NOT THE SAME AS THOSE THE BLS USES TO CALCUATE HOURLY WAGES. And once again, there's more the macroeconomics than hourly wages., and the BLS includes all reported income in their figures. Median income continues to fall below average. This is a very simple concept. &gt;On balance I'd say keep it up, because I'm mostly enjoying throwing actual real facts at your ignoring of reputable sources. Seriously? You haven't provided a single fact, figure, or source. Shoot, an uncited anecdote would be great. You're denying official figures from federal agencies, as well as simple examples of arithmetic.<andypro77>: &gt;Unfortunately, the BLS does include everyone who reports income each year. Keep it up, you're comedy gold. From the BLS: *\"In the United States, wages are benchmarked using average hourly earnings. Data relate to production employees in mining and logging and manufacturing, construction employees in construction, and nonsupervisory employees in the service-providing industries. These groups account for approximately four-fifths of the total employment on private nonfarm payrolls\"* &gt; You're denying official figures from federal agencies You literally just did that and I corrected you, with the official words from a federal agency. I take it back, don't keep going, you're sad embarrassing of yourself is becoming tedious. Read up a little and come back when I don't have to correct your made up facts each time. &amp;#x200B;<StevenGannJr>: &gt; From the BLS: From the BLS: _Thus, average after-tax income\u2014which equals market income plus government transfers minus federal taxes..._ Yeah. Hourly wage figures only include hourly wages. Super. There's a _lot_ more to macroeconomics than hourly wages, though, and minimum wage represents the floor of the wage (hourly and salary) scale. Now. If you're done quibbling over the hourly versus salary and are interested in discussing _the actual topic_, I'd like some source showing that I am incorrect in my original premise that median wages are on decline. Please be sure to note that, while hourly wages are an important metric to track, I am including _all_ wages (just as the BLS and CBO do when measuring income distribution and average wages) so your tiny Far-Right brain isn't confused by rationality and a consistent argument. Heck, I'll go one further and assert that median wages today are lower than average wages in 1970. In the 70's my father worked 3 months of minimum wage and bought a house in Florida. In nominal dollars I make more than 10x that at just a bit over the national _average_ income, and despite living in near destitution I won't have enough saved for a small house for another 7-10 years.<andypro77>: &gt;my original premise Your original premise was this: **And all-time lows when adjusted for inflation. That's Econ 101.** That is provably false. Then, when I proved that false, you pretended you were proving it true by talking about minimum wage instead of hourly wage. Not only did I expose your stupidity on that score, another poster did as well, as he recognized the same logical fallacy. You then decided to once again shift gears by claiming that hourly wages as measured by the BLS are skewed because a small minority of high-earners raise the average. ONCE AGAIN, I proved you wrong by citing the exact standard that the BLS uses to calculate hourly wages. Not taking the hint, you continued by making the provably false statement that the BLS does include everyone who reports income each year, which I ONCE AGAIN had to correct. Here, in a nutshell, is our conversation so far: <YOU>: I believe this <ME>: Nope, here's the facts <YOU>: Ok, what about this then <ME>: Nope, false, here's the proof <YOU>: Well, then how about this... <ME>: Nope, that's not right either, here's the proof <YOU>: Stop quibbling over issues, HERE is what I really want to talk about. &amp;#x200B; You see, you say something that's false, I prove that it's false, and then you move on to something else. There's no logical reason for me to consider anything you have to say in your ignorance unless you first admit that you were wrong about all the other stuff. Because if I take the time anymore to prove you wrong on the next idiotic thing you say, you'll just bring up something different and continue to ignore the fact that **you have been provably, utterly, and totally wrong about everything you've brought up.** <StevenGannJr>: &gt; Your original premise was this: &gt; &gt; And all-time lows when adjusted for inflation. That's Econ 101. &gt; &gt; That is provably false. Then please prove it. Here, in a nutshell, is our conversation so far: <ME>: I believe this <YOU>: You are wrong, but I have no facts or sources to prove it. <ME>: Ok, here's what the federal agencies say <YOU>: Nope, false, still not citing any proof though. <ME>: How are you disputing this without any evidence to back your argument? <YOU>: Well _technically_ it is false if you restrict your definition of wages strictly to hourly wages, ignoring all other macreconomic metrics <ME>: Stop quibbling over pedantry, HERE is what I really want to talk about. <YOU>: Still no facts to dispute your claim. Sorry. &gt;You see, you say something that's false, I prove that it's false, and then you move on to something else. More accurately, I say something, you say it is false but provide no evidence of it, and when I keep demonstrating it you latch on to a very narrow definition of a term. &gt;you have been provably, utterly, and totally wrong about everything you've brought up. lol sure. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, Congressional Budget Office, and Department of Labor statistics are all provably, utterly wrong. You're as deluded as Gavin McInnes.<andypro77>: So, that's a firm 'NO' on you admitting all the things that you were wrong about, right? Ok, good to know. I'll give you one more chance, just do this for me and I'll admit you're right: (1) Prove that hourly wages are at all-time lows when adjusted for inflation (2) Prove that the BLS definition of hourly wages is skewed by a small minority of high earners that raise the average. (3) Prove that the BLS includes everyone who reports income each year (4) Prove that median wages are on the decline ALL of these things were things that you asserted were true, so now I'd like you to prove them for me, if it's not too much trouble. The alternative is for you to shut the hell up. <StevenGannJr>: 1. Average hourly? No. Median income? I already cited the CBO and you rejected it. 2. Hourly? No. Again I already linked the BLS's figures on income distribution and you rejected them. 3. I already did. I suggest reading. 4. Again, I already provided the BLS figures, plus a couple nice charts compile by UC Berkley, and you rejected them. My turn. 1. Prove income equality isn't increasing. 2. Prove that median income is not decreasing relative to average income. 3. Prove that BLS and CBO _don't_ include all reported incomes in their income distribution reports. 4. Prove that median wages _aren't_ on the decline. Considering you've already rejected official sources and figures supporting my argument and disproving yours, I can only assume you'll cite CBTV or some far-right blog about white genocide.<andypro77>: &gt;Average hourly? No. Median income? I already cited the CBO and you rejected it. HERE is exactly what you responded to: &gt; ME: Hourly wages in the US are currently at all-time highs. &gt; &gt;YOU: And all-time lows when adjusted for inflation. That's Econ 101. YOU said that hourly wages were at all-time lows. These are **your exact words.** I have asked you to prove it. You have not proven it. You are pretending you were trying to prove something else, but have not proven your original point. So either prove it or shut the hell up. No reason for me to read the rest when you've failed on the very first point. Admit you were wrong and I'll consider also correcting the other stuff you got wrong. &amp;#x200B;", "num_messages": 21, "avg_score": 1275.1904761905}

I dunno, comparing a serial killer (might be mentally ill, sure, then we can compare it) to a drug user is just fucking stupid imo. Should Trump be saved? I mean, he have signed orders that have killed thousands. Does he deserve to be saved? This is how ridicilous your argument really is. Keep on the topic instead. [deleted]: &gt; Saving someone that is dying by providing narcan is never bad. Saving somebody who will go on to kill 1000 people is not bad? That's a pretty bold statement. Saving Hitler in 1939 by providing narcan is not bad. &gt; Keep on the topic instead. This is the topic. Is it moral to save people who will provide a detriment to society? &gt; Should Trump be saved? I mean, he have signed orders that have killed thousands. Does he deserve to be saved? According to you, he does deserve to be saved. I don't think you can definitively state that it is good or bad. <sekips>: on Hitler? Yeah, please derail the discussion even more. First comparing a drug addict to a serial killer, now to Hitler? on Trump? Ofc, why shouldnt he be saved? He is a lying douchebag, that indirectly have killed thousands. Doesnt mean he shouldnt deserve to live? I mean, it is his job to do those decisions. Doesnt make it right thou. US is the worst example of a working drug policy. Your \"war on drugs\" have fucked over way more people than this guy saving 94 addicts from death. [deleted]: &gt; Saving someone that is dying by providing narcan is never bad. You stated that saving someone that is dying by providing narcan is never bad, to include somebody like Hitler. You are advocating for saving Hitler and the killing of millions of Jews and others. To me, that does not sound good. &gt; Your \"war on drugs\" have fucked over way more people than this guy saving 94 addicts from death. Good. Fuck drug users. State sanctioned Darwinism. <sekips>: Hitler never OD'd, administrating narcan wouldnt have saved anyone, but keep going, please. [deleted]: &gt; Hitler never OD'd, administrating narcan wouldnt have saved anyone, Yes this is a hypothetical. That is how hypotheticals work. I'll try another hypothetical that might make more sense below. &gt; but keep going, please. Love to. If someone who you know is going to cause a detriment to society, is it 'good' to save them? You indicated that yes, no matter what it is good to save them. With the implication that even if they are mass murderers, rapists, etc., that it is still objectively 'good' to save them. And I find it an interesting viewpoint and would love to hear more of your thoughts on it. Do you still stand with your statement that it is always good to save them? <sekips>: If I know that someone is going to do something bad, I would stop them from doing something bad. I wouldnt stop them from surviving an overdose. [deleted]: &gt; If I know that someone is going to do something bad, I would stop them from doing something bad. Then you end up dying because they are stronger than you and overpower you. They then go on to kill more people because that's what they do. Was saving them a good thing? Is saving somebody who is going to do a bad thing that you cannot stop, a good thing? It's a yes or no question. You seemed so certain of it before when you stated that \"Saving someone that is dying by providing narcan is never bad.\" But now you seem to be back pedalling to the point that you can't even stand by your original statement. Which is fine and my point entirely, that blanket statements like that are pretty dumb. <sekips>: So you know that they are stronger than me? And you know my response? I mean, not like I would call the cops on them, amirite? I would solve it myself. [deleted]: &gt; So you know that they are stronger than me? And you know my response? I mean, not like I would call the cops on them, amirite? I would solve it myself. That's great, in this hypothetical, you cannot. Why are you so afraid of backing up your statement now? Why are you looking for loopholes or work arounds, when \"Saving someone that is dying by providing narcan is never bad.\" If it's never bad, then saving a serial killer isn't bad. No matter what he ends up doing. No matter if you cannot stop him and he does kill more people. Per your original statement. Stand by your statement, or don't. <sekips>: So in this hypothetical world we have no control over population at all? Why are you looking for loopholes to make saving lives looking bad? There is a reason why doctors treat all patients, not just the \"good ones\". How would you know that a guy is a serial killer before you administer narcan? You call the nonexistant cops and ask? This is getting fucking silly dude. :P [deleted]: &gt; This is getting fucking silly dude. :P What's silly is how much back pedalling you are doing. Do you stand by your statement, \"Saving someone that is dying by providing narcan is never bad.\" or not? You seem to disagree with it now. What I hear you say, is that it's never bad, if you can prevent them from doing bad things. Not that it is 'never bad'. &gt; Why are you looking for loopholes to make saving lives looking bad? Because saving lives isn't always good. You yourself seem to agree based on conditions you've set, and the fact you will not stand behind your statement without those conditions being met. Thereby requiring that it is never bad if those conditions are satisfied, but not all encompassing never bad. &gt; There is a reason why doctors treat all patients, not just the \"good ones\". We aren't arguing whether or not doctors should or should not treat all patients, we are arguing whether or not \"Saving someone that is dying by providing narcan is never bad.\" You seem pretty adamant about not supporting that statement, which makes sense, because it was a stupid statement. Let's both agree that it is a stupid statement, and just move on. <sekips>: It becomes silly when you make up shit that could never happen. \"you have to stop him yourself, you cant use the police!\" Like wtf? How is that a \"real thing\" ? You base your shit on retarded rules. :) If I saw someone dying on the street I would try to save that person. I wouldnt check his ID and do a background check before I start. See where I am coming from yet? [deleted]: &gt; It becomes silly when you make up shit that could never happen. But it could happen. And you stated: \"Saving someone that is dying by providing narcan is never bad.\" To include this exact situation. Never means all situations does it not? &gt; If I saw someone dying on the street I would try to save that person. So it's never bad as long as they're somebody you don't know and they're dying on the street? That doesn't sound like NEVER BAD\" to me. That sounds like it is rarely sometimes good for this specific situation. &gt; See where I am coming from yet? I see that you are backing down and are actively disagreeing with that statement you made. Because it was a silly statement. Staunchly defending a viewpoint you actually disagree with because of your pride is about the silliest thing of all of this. <sekips>: No, I am not backing down. If I had narcan on me and saw someone overdose on opiods I would help them, I wouldnt ask if the person was a serial killer first. But you sound like you would have done a 3 month background check before you even considering it. You sound like the kind of human I wouldnt want helping me, even if I was dying of an overdose. :P [deleted]: &gt; If I had narcan on me and saw someone overdose on opiods I would help them, I wouldnt ask if the person was a serial killer first. That's great, but it's still disagreeing with your previous statement. Your previous statement was not, would you save someone that you saw overdose, it was: \"Saving someone that is dying by providing narcan is never bad.\" This includes any hypothetical situation where you know they are a serial killer, rapist, and will go on to do those things, yet choose to save them anyways. You yourself are disagreeing with that statement, continually lol. &gt; But you sound like you would have done a 3 month background check before you even considering it. Of course not, but if I knew somebody was a serial killer and was going to kill more people, I would definitely not save them. I would also never say that \"Saving someone that is dying by providing narcan is never bad,\" because that's stupid. &gt; You sound like the kind of human I wouldnt want helping me, even if I was dying of an overdose. :P Based on the limited information I have, of course I would save you. But that does not mean I would save you if I found out that you were a serial killer and would kill people and was dying of an overdose. Blanket statements are dumb. <sekips>: And misrepresenting what I wrote ON PURPOSE to make a big argument out of it is also dumb. Kinda like your hypothetical scenarios where I am supposed to stop someone from doing something but you set all the rules for it. You dont know if I am the Hulk irl. :P [deleted]: &gt; And misrepresenting what I wrote ON PURPOSE to make a big argument out of it is also dumb. Using statements like NEVER implies for all situations. There is no misrepresentation here. Words have meaning. All you had to do was say that you misspoke but for some reason you continued to defend an argument that you disagreed with because you're too prideful. &gt; You dont know if I am the Hulk irl. :P Well if your instagram is the same as your reddit profile then you're some skater loser with a pierced nipple and bad hair<sekips>: Awh, thanks for the views. Calling someone a loser on the internet make you so so cool. :) [deleted]: &gt; Calling someone a loser on the internet make you so so cool. :) Thanks. I'm sure you thought dying your hair or that weird mohawk would make you cool too. You'll get there little buddy. <sekips>: Your username clearly checks out btw. [deleted]: Thanks.

It\u2019s give fish while you teach to fish so he and his family don\u2019t starve and die before he can learn well enough to be effective. Is it bad that people are in need? Sure. But that doesn\u2019t mean helping people is bad. \u201cYou will always find people who are helping,\u201d Fred Rogers wrote in the Mister Rogers Parenting Book. He continued: \u201cTo this day, especially in times of 'disaster,' I remember my mother's words and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers \u2014 so many caring people in this world.\u201d That is uplifting. Often literally. <mrjameshines>: I'm not debating whether they serve an incredible service or not, because they obviously do. But literally every circumstance in which they are needed is a bad one, and you've just listed a bunch on them. These situations are certainly not uplifting, and the use of food banks shouldn't be normalised especially when it's occuring in some of the wealthiest countries in the world", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 42.8333333333}

It's not like dogs understand the concept of cancer, is it?<PointNegotiator>: Dogs and cats both get accustomed to your smell. It's how they can recognize you even after years apart. One theory is: when you live with an animal that is used to sensing you in this way, cancer is a rogue protein sequence that can wreak havoc with other cells. Sometimes this changes the way you smell and can smell necrotic or like part of you is a stranger. <hexiron>: Cancer is incredibly metabolically active causing build ups of toxins as well as the necrosis of surrounding tissue or the cancer itself. When it's sized up enough people can smell it and it isn't very pleasant. <TikkiTakiTomtom>: Toxins and necrosis?<hexiron>: Junk chemicals and dead tissue? Cell poop and skeletons? Lactic acid and lysed membrain chunks? I'm not sure what nouns you're looking for... <TikkiTakiTomtom>: Dead tissue = cell \u201cpoop\u201d/[cyto]skeletons = lysed membrane chunks. All of these closely mean the same thing. Lactic acid is not waste. It is a byproduct that can be recycled. I think the point I\u2019m trying to make here is that cancers do not simply cause other cells to die in fact they make the cells *live forever*. Nor do they create toxins or induce necrosis. <Edit>: I\u2019ll leave the mistake I made as is but I meant to say in my last sentence is that cancers do not create toxins and therefore induce necrosis (by said toxins). The fact that I commented \u201ctoxins and necrosis\u201d above was solely for this clarification.<CactusCustard>: &gt; All of these closely mean the same thing. Isnt that you were asking for? He gave the words he wanted to say. you acted like they werent good enough, so he gave you synonyms. And cancer can and does induce necrosis. <https>://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/necrosis.htm You're trying to be all smart and \"lol toxins dont exist\" but its not working.<TikkiTakiTomtom>: Yes I apologize, my wording was off. What I meant to say was that cancers dont produce toxins and therefore does not induce necrosis (via toxins). It personally bothers me however when people shares misinformation and people eat it up.<hexiron>: See, but cancer does release toxins that do in fact cause serious problems. They have a hard time accessing the nutrients and oxygen required to sustain their metabolic growth so their metabolism shifts to accommodate. However, for the same reasons they can't receive proper nutrients the body has a hard time eliminating the byproducts produced. You seem to be stuck on toxins, but that's what they are in those concentrations. Lactic acid, for example, can be recycled as you say HOWEVER the increase in pH caused by this concentration of lactic acid both inhibits t-cells from being able to fight cancer as well as skewing the tissue associated macrophages to a tumor promoting state, where those macrophages begin to turn that lactic acid into proteins the cancer cells can then utilize as more efficient energy. With that rapid growth you can get dead zones where tissue begins to become necrotic because such sustained high pH, a hypoxic environment, and M2 macrophage polarization triggers apoptosis of other cells. I know this, because I ran a cancer research lab and helped write the damn paper on the topic. <TikkiTakiTomtom>: I apologize for sounding harsh and cynical but for personal selfish reasons I don\u2019t tolerate a spreading of misinformation. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t believe what you claim to be. It\u2019s great that you have the passion for this field but this is incorrect.<hexiron>: Personal selfish reasons that you yourself are being ignorant to any of the information people are trying to give you? Here's an infographic to help you out. <http>://jcs.biologists.org/content/125/23/5591<TikkiTakiTomtom>: I guess this entire dispute was over the conceptual use of toxin. Maybe I\u2019m being a bit pedantic but in terms of medicine we don\u2019t usually refer to exacerbating effects as a toxin. When I think of a toxin, I think of something that is non-self that can directly affect cells in a destructive manner. Inflammation caused by lactate may *decrease* pH but inflammation is inflammation. We produce a lot of lactate via exercise but we can\u2019t call it a toxin just because it decreases function of proteins. If that\u2019s the case we can call many things as toxins. Call me ignorant but in your argument you claim cancer release toxins but your support only provides signaling proteins/genes as the crux of the article (to which these proteins btw are naturally occurring but only accumulated, detected and associated with tumor growth). Based on this I can\u2019t say that I agree that this is a toxin any more or less than it is just the usual proteins.<hexiron>: Extremely pedantic. \"The car crash didn't kill him it was exsanguination\", \"Heart attacks are completely safe, it's the hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy you have to worry about\"... This is a pic forum and any scientist or clinitians duty is to translate this technical knowledge into colloquial understanding for the masses. <TikkiTakiTomtom>: But the thing is... calling something a toxin when it is truly not is wrong. The proteins in question are not toxic. Im calling myself pedantic only because you\u2019re calling a dog, a cat. And FYI In the field people dont die simply because of heart attack, they die of secondary complications days or weeks after the fact.

It's hard to see because the media keeps talking about the worst wars, but generally situations are improving. Consider the 20th century, 2 world wars, one cold war where both sides had huge nukes, middle East still in crisis, Korean war, Vietnam war and so many more. And while it is too early in the 21st century, the only big war is happening in middle East. Terrorism has been decreasing ever since and poverty is also lowering. <shortyafter>: This is a huge misconception. You know why wars have been getting lesser? Because if we had another full-scale conflict the size of WW2, it would involve nukes, and mutually assured destruction. It's not because of the benevolence of humanity, it's a selfish bet for survival. The same bullshit. People thought the same thing after the Napoleonic Wars... there would be ever-lasting peace, the wars were too terrible. 100 years later WW1. Then WW2. We're due for another one soon... maybe we'll forget Hiroshima. Terrorism arose because we no longer have this \"open\" channel for hatred, division, unconsciousness. It's smaller-scale. Same thing with school shootings and all of that.

In this case, there isn't a good option. Not a reasonable one at least. You just have to choose the option that has the greater potential outcome And when you say \"world getting better\"... What is \"better\"? Extremely subjective don't you think? If \"better\" means an overall decrease in violent crime and death, then yes. It is getting better. <shortyafter>: In some respects, I appreciate your rationality. Everyone else seems to be getting quite heated with me, but you have remained cool, collected. You must be a great thinker, I can tell you have a very intelligent mind. But I think you have one flaw: you're being TOO rational. You're conforming with something that we don't even know. Who said utopia doesn't exist? Yes, there will always be problems. But who knows how far up we can go? You are setting a limit, your mind is setting a limit. But in reality we have no idea what the limit is. I imagine I'm not the first person to point this quality (your rationality) out to you, for better or for worse. It's not a judgement. As I said, you must be very intelligent. That's beautiful. But I wonder if you can open yourself up to something broader.<AWellDressedChicken>: Hey I appreciate that. Sincerely. Can you elaborate on your second paragraph? How do you mean \"too rational?\" Do you believe a utopia does exist in our physical reality at this time, or lare you just saying that we haven't proven it to be impossible? For example, communism, in theory, is a very successful and efficient way to run a country. However humans have shown over and over that such a system appears to be incompatible with humanity and would be unsustainable if put into practice. I gotta head out to work. But you seem like somebody I'd enjoy having a conversation with. Feel free to continue this through pm if you'd like. <shortyafter>: All I'm saying is that we don't know. I understand your question, but I am going to dismiss your question. We don't know where the limit is. The mind always wants to know, but through the mind, it is impossible to know. Yes, we can know things like that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. But we cannot know what our possibilities are as individuals or even as humanity as a whole... that is completely uncharted territory. I believe communism didn't fail because of communism... communism failed because of people. For millennia we have killed each other over petty political games, and of course, when something like communism comes along, even if it seems like a good idea, it will be used to the same malignant ends. Look at a person like Jesus. I am not a Christian, but I believe that Jesus had a good message (remove all hocus-pocus humbug from it). And then look at what the Christians did. They completely bastardized a good message and used it for the same old games - crusades, Inquisition, murder, genocide. Such is humanity. I am only saying - we don't know the limit, BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED. We keep playing the same old games, under different names, -isms, and ideologies. But at heart we have not taken a step into the unknown. Individuals have, yes. Jesus was one of them. Buddha was one of them. I am one of them. But the society is still reluctant... Jesus was killed over it... change was too scary. Better to shut him up quick than face the truth. They did the same to Socrates. These people wanted to overturn the whole order, people were going to lose power. So they killed them. Yes, I appreciate that. You are the first who has responded positively to what I'm saying. To be honest, I'm not trolling. I'm feeling things out. I've slowly but surely been walking away from my societal conditioning, but it's only been the last few days that I've really taken a big leap. I feel I have reached a turning point. Tomorrow, who knows? That is the mind looking for an answer again. But I don't know how far this goes, or where it goes, or anything like that. It is completely uncharted for me. So today I am enjoying feeling this stuff out. I am sharing my truth and I am getting very negative responses from just about everyone. I am sharing my truth with my girlfriend and she is about ready to leave me - NOBODY understands me. And I look at them, like Jesus on the cross, and know that I WILL NOT RENOUNCE. Why? Because, it is the right thing to do. It is the right thing for ME, and it is the right thing for humanity. I am slightly surprised at how negative people are being. Why are they negative? It's a defense mechanism. Plus, they only listen to the surface of my message - they completely miss the essence. And then again, knowing what I know now, this sort of reaction is not surprising at all. The most surprising reaction has been yours. Thanks for listening and chatting, have a good day at work and feel free to send me a message or respond to me here. :)<AWellDressedChicken>: I agree entirely with you on your views of communism. In an ideal world, it's the perfect plan. Unfortunately it's not an ideal world. Evil exists and will always exist. From a psychology perspective, some of the most common traits among those in power is a need to be in control, unstoppable ambition, and a lack of empathy. What sociologists consider ideal traits include modesty and humility. Obviously the ideal world is very different from reality. So, I agree with you, it's not the idea, it's the people who put it into motion. And if I may offer my sincere opinion, perhaps the reason you are met with such negativity is because your opinion is one which is clearly very passionate and that can come across as impeding and elitist. That's just the sort of vibe I got from reading it. Of course, it's not nearly as easy to interpret the voice behind words when all you see is the characters on a screen. So my advice? Maintain your views and don't let other's opinions of you change that. However, it might be a good idea to only bring up said views in appropriate situations. I hope that sort of makes sense and doesn't come across as condescending. <shortyafter>: Hi mate, you might be totally right. I don't know. I appreciate it.
