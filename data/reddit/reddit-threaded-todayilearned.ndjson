You may get lucky (one in a million) and get to jump from ice to ice, but it does not freeze.<arctichominid>: Nonetheless, there are significant portions that are frozen.

But by all means, pretend that the arctic isn't experiencing climate change indicative of California burning. It's fake news until your house burns down. And by then, maybe you deserve it.<9r1fFN3sS>: I lived in Alaska for four years. I was stationed at JBER. I believe anthropomorphic climate change is happening. The US is responsible for 15% of global emissions. India and China are responsible for the majority, and they weren't even on the Paris Accord. I'm very willing to have a discussion, but your hyperbole helps ***nothing***. The scare tactics are not productive. The data is and has been flawed. The warming is real, the projections and timelines are not. I dispute the proposed solutions and then folks like yourself shut down conversation. You are unwilling to accept anything but blind devotion to your opinion. Examine how you responded to me. I said something was a misconception, you turned it into climate denial. You are not going to help anything or anyone with that approach. You are unable to accept other people can have an opinion counter to yours, and it can be valid. That is the world. You don't have all the answers, you are not the sole arbiter of truth. None of us have all the answers. Be humble, listen, and be respectful. Discuss, don't dictate. I think you'll have much more success that way.<Enthused_Llama>: &gt; I dispute the proposed solutions But you don't. You just handwave about how data is 'flawed' and insist that we just can't do anything because China exists, based on your post. I've seen these exact lines trotted out a thousand times by people and their 'solution' is always just 'wait and see and definitely don't change anything because we might not have a 100% accurate prediction at this moment in time.' Now, maybe that's not the category you fall under, but without fail every time I see the lines of reasoning you're going down, that's where it leads.<9r1fFN3sS>: I don't know how I don't? I specifically stated *why* I did not like the Paris Accords; India and China weren't included. I also disagree we should be funding it all. (I can go on about Breton Woods, communism, US energy independence, US pulling back from the world. It's tangential but pretty pertinent) The climate alarmism has been happening since I was in elementary school, and I'm in my mid 30s now. I firmly believe it is another expansion of government power, which I am opposed to. In my view, we all like to pass off our moral and social responsibilities to the government. It's a lot harder for us to give to charity, volunteer our time, etc. It's easier to just let the government handle it. I don't think we can legislate morality. It's unrealistic to expect everyone to be such, so there *is* a role for government. The level of their involvement is up for debate. There is a balance that must be struck. There was a time when both sides would give a little, and we would pass legislation. Since none of us can have a conversation anymore, our elected representatives are now reflecting the way we treat each other. Both sides are complaining about the other when we're ***all*** at fault. We get the government we deserve.<Enthused_Llama>: Okay so yeah, your argument is to shrug and say that you saw something which suggested particular parts of it qualified as 'alarmism' because, presumably, since you're following the rest of the script, you're unaware that science is is a continual process and large models for distributed systems that you simply can't measure to 100% accuracy all the time are continually refined, so we should just sit around and hope nothing bad happens, as I predicted. &gt; The climate alarmism has been happening since I was in elementary school, and I'm in my mid 30s now. \"The world hasn't actually ended yet, so clearly it was all fake.\" &gt; I firmly believe it is another expansion of government power, MUH GUBMENT. Being opposed to an expansion of government simply because it's an expansion is not in itself a reason. Worker protections were an expansion of government power during the industrial revolution, would you have opposed those too? &gt; It's a lot harder for us to give to charity, volunteer our time, etc. Charities also don't achieve an even distribution of welfare like a government can. It's all well and good if you live in an affluent area, but ones where people are suffering more are going to have less resources because there's less money floating around that local economy. You can also have a semi-consistent budget if you don't operate entirely on donations, meaning you can give a fairly accurate picture of what resources you'll be able to provide at any given moment. Not to mention the amount of laughably corrupt private charities we see today. &gt; I don't think we can legislate morality. lolwut. This is a completely meaningless statement. Let me guess, you're mere moments away from whipping out the sick volcano meme?<9r1fFN3sS>: So we should act on this incomplete information which has been moving the goal posts for 30 years?

You will never have a system like that in America. You can certainly keep trying for it if that's what you want. You call it meaningless because you don't see value in it. I can't give you my perspective. I'm trying to share it with you. You mock and ridicule because it's easier than considering other views. It's easier to do online. My opinion is you haven't experienced enough of the world yet. I don't say that to be rude. I was the exact same way for a long time, certain in my ways and opinions.

The more we act like this, the worse off our country is going to be.<Enthused_Llama>: &gt; So we should act on this incomplete information which has been moving the goal posts for 30 years? By 2000... I see you haven't taken a single moment to learn about statistical modeling. I really don't have the hour minimum of introductory course to teach you this. I guess they should've just ignored Kepler when his work first came out, since he couldn't predict Mars' location to the microarcsecond. \\*I mean, this whole argument is basically 'you said that bearing would have 0.01\" of wear at this point, but it actually only has 0.0076\", so clearly there's no wear at all and we never need to replace it.\" What do you do when you predictions don't match up exactly? Do you just chuck the whole thing and decide it never happened? No, you *refine your model*. That's *exactly* what keeps happening. Because that's how science works. &gt; So now what do you propose? What else do we need to do to fix our 15%? Are you foolish enough to believe India and China are going to curb emissions? Let's break this sentence down: 1). We start out with the implication that if I don't have the silver bullet, I should just shut up. 2). We finish with a hard pivot to 'BUT CHINA AND INDIA ARE BAD' which is completely irrelevant to your first point, but is thrown in there in an insulting manner to ignore whatever answer I give.

It's *especially* meaningless when you consider the absolute explosion of networked technology needed to accurately measure this shit we've had since they started worrying about it. &gt; You call it meaningless because you don't see value in it. I call it meaningless because it's absurdly reductive. Most of our laws are based on some perceived morality. &gt; My opinion is you haven't experienced enough of the world yet. For starters, you don't know how old I am. For seconds, being old doesn't mean shit. Plenty of stupid old people. Plenty of stupid young people. Plenty of people who by all means have experienced tons of the world yet still maintain a ridiculously self-centered view and refuse to consider things outside of their own situations. Now, I know you didn't specifically mention it here, but you do in your other comments. *Considering again that you clearly want any sort of prediction or modeling to be 100% accurate and have no concept of what it actually takes or respect for the process, it's pretty rich that you would start pontificating about 'not having enough experience.' I get so, so tired of people who have a very base-level understanding of complex fields and assume they know it all. &gt; Are we going to act like the government is also not massively corrupt? Especially corrupt as of late, yes. &gt; Be intellectually honest. Says intellectually dishonest man. Your post is *full* of disingenuous assertions and pivots. &gt; The more we act like this, the worse off our country is going to be. Yes, clearly we need to meet somewhere in the middle of 'large swathes of populated area becoming uninhabitable at some not 100% precise point in the future' and 'just do nothing lol.' Clearly, it's the fault of people disagreeing with extremists that anything is wrong.<9r1fFN3sS>: Anyone who disagrees with you is an extremist. Nice. I am legitimately sharing my opinion of age, experience, and perspective. It's not monolithic, but it's what I've experienced in my life. I do not think we'll ever be in the same place politically, but seeing the way you talk, respond, denigrate, and insult, it's like looking in the mirror ten years ago. I really think there are solutions to discuss. Us spending a bunch of money to economically disadvantage ourselves is not something I agree with. Shale has allowed us to be, or very shortly become, energy independent. That is the last real link of our imports from the world economy. We are the least dependent upon the system we created to fight the Soviets. The Chinese are utterly dependent upon this system. We no longer need it. I think that's a great starting point. I said I don't have all the answers, and you continually act like you have all the answers and everything is settled. It's not. You only want to disparage and that's unfortunate. This is how we treat one another, and that is how our politicians behave.<Enthused_Llama>: &gt; Anyone who disagrees with you is an extremist. Nice.

That's your plan for long term sustainability? &gt; I said I don't have all the answers, and you continually act like you have all the answers and everything is settled. The only one demanding exact solutions and acting as if they know everything here is you. I merely point out where your reasoning is flawed. &gt; You only want to disparage and that's unfortunate. Classic response from someone who began insulting people the moment he was disagreed with. You can give but you can't take.<9r1fFN3sS>: Who did I insult? I admit the emotions do get going when you are bombarded with folks disagreeing and slinging shit. We don't act the best when we do so from a place of emotion, myself included. I still fail that test at times. Less frequently, but it still happens. You seem hostile. I'm making observations. You don't have to like it. Clearly you don't agree, and that's okay. You're acting like only one side has flaws in their arguments. The issue is people only focusing on what they want to see. I have a more right leaning view, you a left leaning view. If you can't stop for five seconds and acknowledge you do not have all the answers, then there is nothing further to discuss. I have repeatedly stated I do not know everything. You get mad at what I say and start slinging shit because you want to be right.<Enthused_Llama>: &gt; Are you foolish enough to believe India and China are going to curb emissions? &gt; I didn't say it was fake, I said the time tables are wrong.

One hard pivot after another. <EDIT>: The fact is, you came out of the gate acting as if you had all the answers. You came out going \"Huh well i was stationed in Alaska, and I read a couple of articles, so I can tell you the best course of action on climate change is to just shrug and hope it goes away.\" But the *moment* you were called on it you immediately retreated and started whining about how the political situation is tense lately and downplaying everything as if it's all some minor disagreement and we're not talking about actual, real lives that hang in the balance when it comes to political decisions.<9r1fFN3sS>: I think you just want to be angry and upset because you don't like what I say. That's fine.<Enthused_Llama>: &gt; The fact is, you came out of the gate acting as if you had all the answers.

Hahahahahaahaha. Never did I say shrug and say do nothing, you inserted that. You are clearly just pissed I don't agree. In 1989 the UN said by 2000 climate change is going to melt all the icebergs. They were wrong. That's okay, I'm wrong too. Can we just acknowledge the rate of change and the dramatic changes causing everyone to die is *not* certain? Or are you saying if we don't do anything, in 12 years we'll all be dead? When is it all going to hell, from your view?<Enthused_Llama>: You're still not getting it. If you'll notice, I've very specifically *avoided* making strong claims about any timelines or specific events, because it's not my field of study and I'm keenly aware that there are many factors I simply don't have the training to take into account. What I am sure of, though, is that the scientific community is as near as you can get to a consensus on the subject and will continually refine their models. We know it's coming, even if we can't give you an exact date. It's a very gradual process. There's not going to be a 'moment' where it all goes to shit. It will just slowly but surely become shit. After a certain point, we'll have rerached a positive feedback loop that results in acceleration, but there's still not going to be some satisfying biblical cataclysm where you can point to it and go 'there it is.' <EDIT>: The issue is you used this specific event, wherein one particular body made a bad prediction when the field was in its infancy that didn't turn out to be entirely correct, and then use it to discredit the following *40 years* of research. It's *disgustingly* disingenuous.<9r1fFN3sS>: The second part is wrong, plain and simple. The *scientific* community also includes folks who do *not* study climate, correct? It's happening. The impact, extent, and timeline are up for debate. That is not sufficient to implement radical policy changes which will impact the country and our fellow citizens. I am willing to listen and change my mind when presented with new evidence. There is no evidence that we are all going to die in 12 years. That is why I would say be prudent, make efforts, but do not implement drastic policy changes. I stated our energy independence is important. All of that *gubment* investment you criticize in one industry, you wholly support in others. How hypocritical of you. There is no consistency, just whatever supports your world view.<Enthused_Llama>: &gt; The second part is wrong, plain and simple. The scientific community also includes folks who do not study climate, correct? It's happening. The impact, extent, and timeline are up for debate. It's pretty clear that I meant the community who studies this. I don't know why in the world you would go for this pivot, other than that you don't really have any point to back it up. &gt; I am willing to listen and change my mind when presented with new evidence. No you aren't, you made up your mind 19 years ago. &gt; All of that gubment investment you criticize in one industry, you wholly support in others. How hypocritical of you. Holy *FUCK* you are so self-unaware. I *specifically* listed that because it could be viewed as an expansion of government, which you were against before just for the sake of being against it. That's why I used the wording that matched how I said it earlier. I **NEVER** said it was a problem, I merely pointed out that it happened. Yet you completely gloss over it and then think *I'm* the one being hypocritical. Fuck dude is this a troll account? Do you typically own yourself this hard? How can you be so blind to yourself? It's kinda baffling honestly. You can clearly see the hypocrisy when *other* people do it (or at least, when you think other people do it) but completely ignore it when it comes to yourself. Somehow all that age and world experience never culminated in meaningful introspection.<9r1fFN3sS>: You just want to be right.

I mean the \u201creal\u201d paparazzi photos are literally creepshots, they\u2019re never going to be from a flattering angle, and it\u2019s easy to take an unflattering angle of a butt (remember when the paparazzi took a picture of JLaws butt that was so unflattering she didn\u2019t believe it was her?). If I wanted to make fun of someone I\u2019m also probably not going to pick a flattering picture anyways. It\u2019s reached this point where to some people they literally can\u2019t have a nice butt, like even a borderline attractive photo: has to be photoshop!

That\u2019s all fine, what makes me think these people couldn\u2019t get someone who\u2019s the equivalent of Kim within their own tastes is feeling a need to compare her to dirty diapers and complain about how revolting she is every chance they get.<Futoi_Saru>: When you are an influencer who change peoples perceptions of reality, by getting plastic surgeries and modifying your body, this is why anxiety and self harm for young girls is sky rocketing.

I haven't read it all, but I've read bits and pieces from Julius Caesers' book about the Gallic Wars. The guy had a touch for the dramatic.<positiveParadox>: I've read De Bello Gallico in both Latin and English. It reads as an often triumphant account of Caesar's many victories and exploits in Gaul and even Britannia. One of my favorite moments in the naval invasion of Britannia is one where soldiers of Caesar were afraid to leave the boats. &gt;And while our men were hesitating [whether they should advance to the shore], chiefly on account of the depth of the sea, he who carried the eagle of the tenth legion, after supplicating the gods that the matter might turn out favourably to the legion, exclaimed, \"Leap, fellow soldiers, unless you wish to betray your eagle to the enemy. I, for my part, will perform my duty to the commonwealth and my general.\" Caesar rarely mentions individual soldiers so this moment is extraordinary. As a whole, this work served as a thrilling tale of Caesar's exploits that boosted his popularity, oftentimes as an embellishment of fact. For instance, there is no archeological evidence that wicker men existed and there are few writers that talk about the phenomenon. Caesar's documentation is one of the most prominent. &gt;The whole Gallic race is addicted to religious ritual; consequently those suffering from serious maladies or subject to the perils of battle sacrifice human victims. \u2026 Some weave huge figures of wicker and fill their limbs with humans, who are then burned to death when the figures are set afire. They suppose that the gods prefer this execution to be applied to thieves, robbers, and other malefactors taken in the act, but in default of such they resort to the execution of the innocent. It perfectly suits Caesar's case for his conquest if he portrays Gallic peoples as savage and brutish while he, the civilized Roman, gifts them civilization through his wars. Essentially, this book is a story and the only first/secondhand account of many of the events it depicts. Theres no way to know for sure what exactly happened, but archaeological evidence helps document the battles that took place. With that in mind, it's important to note that Caesar was a charismatic and manipulative individual who overthrew centuries of Republican Traditon. The Dictator Sulla, who arguably paved the way for Caesar's Dictatorship, saw Caesar as similar to the dangerous revolutionary Marius.\"In this Caesar there are many Mariuses.\"<Peil>: So much of \"pop history\" is based entirely off the ideas Romans had about other peoples.

Really? &gt; using my power to get away with abusing children So how does someone know that? What do you think it'll take for people to decide you are and therefore should be killed since your clearly not innocent is all that's needed in your mind?<Knows_all_secrets>: The fact that vigilante violence is not always properly directed is not an argument against vigilante violence in contexts where you can be certain it is. Say it's ten years &gt; So how does someone know that? Well, I'm not a powerful British man who is clearly a child molestor but getting away with it because I'm effectively above the law. I'm not advocating violence against the potentially innocent, only the clearly guilty. Say it's ten years ago and you find yourself in a dark alley with Cyril Smith or Jimmy Savile - we both know these men got away with raping children because they were powerful and well connected. Are you seriously arguing killing them is wrong? Because it's clearly the right thing to do.<Morbidly-A-Beast>: So your, what expecting people to just *know* with certainty whether someone's a pedo? Before Jimmy Savile died did you think he was a certain pedo? Would you have killed him *on the possibility* he was a pedo? In some peoples minds, their certain that every 'Asian' or Muslim is a paedophile so are you gonna argue for them to be killed? Since in their mind, its 'it's clearly the right thing to do' and how could anyone 'seriously arguing killing them is wrong?'.<Knows_all_secrets>: No, I'm not. I said several times I'm not advocating violence against the potentially innocent - but if someone knew a reasonable amount of the following? &gt; 'In November 2012, GMP Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood said there was \"overwhelming evidence\" that young boys were sexually and physically abused by Smith.[8] In April 2014, it was reported that there had been 144 complaints against Smith from victims as young as eight, but attempts to prosecute him had always been blocked. Public authorities including Rochdale Council, the police and intelligence services have been implicated in covering up Smith's crimes. In 2015, it emerged that Smith had been arrested in the early 1980s in relation to these offences, but a high level cover-up reportedly led to him being released within hours, the evidence destroyed and the investigating officers prevented from discussing the matter under the Official Secrets Act' Then they would be perfectly justified in slaughtering him, wouldn't they?<thekintnerboy>: &gt;Then they would be perfectly justified in slaughtering him, wouldn't they? Absolutely not, no. Unequivocally, emphatically, categorically not. You know that, though, you're just trolling.<Knows_all_secrets>: &gt; Unequivocally, emphatically, categorically you should let a child rapist keep raping children. And I'm apparently the one trolling.<thekintnerboy>: You're indulging in a hypothetical, though; a situation where all of the accusations mentioned above suddenly become widely known and indisputable *facts* about a person, by some magical reason. And yet the authorities *still* protect him, and he can go about his life like normal and keep raping children. In this Twilight Zone episode, vigilante justice suddenly seems less crazy and would probably be justified. However, this is not a realistic proposal, it hasn't and never will come to a situation like that. If me, you, and the public at large had been in possession of those facts about C. Smith in the 1980s, the coverup would (obviously) not have been successful. Under no circumstances would C. Smith have been able to \"keep raping children\" - but that is not your primary concern anyway. You want revenge, not prevention; you want perpetrators \"slaughtered.\" To your mind, the fact that I don't share this sentiment is equal to me condoning the criminal acts in question; to my mind, the fact that you have this sentiment is equal to you condoning barbarism. Let's leave it like that.", "num_messages": 19, "avg_score": 465.5789473684}

I'd be surprised if this percentage was much different now.<EbenHSHD>: Trump didn\u2019t make nonracist people suddenly become racist lol<enigma1235>: No, he just gave the racists the opportunity to openly express it.<Crunglemungle>: Before trump was president, no racist was ever allowed to express their views. Is that what you're implying? <Steve_Danger_Gaming>: You know exactly what they're saying. Racists at least used to hide it somewhat because they would get at least nasty looks or called out for saying or doing something overtly racist. But now Trumps followers have banded together and done everything possible to normalize grotesque behaviour. They all get together and start saying aloud the things they never dared to, and when the other Trumpists not only agree but cheer them on they get a sense that it's not just OK, but that it's right and they're justified in their beliefs. Since Trump came into office I saw ally friends who were kind of on the fence before just go full-on damn near card-carrying KKK. I sure wouldn't wanna be a non white person in America right now. Well ever. If you think race relations haven't changed for the worse since he got into office you're either lying or your eyes are closed. <BuckinghamHelmet>: Smells like bullshit but ok <Steve_Danger_Gaming>: So are you refuting the *fact* race relations in general have taken a nosedive since Trump came into office? <BuckinghamHelmet>: https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/2-views-of-race-relations/ Took a nosedive my ass. Where's your \"fact\" now that I have statistics to prove they were just as shit before Trump as they are after Trump? I don't understand your need to have a Boogeyman to point the finger at.<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Where's my fact now that you want to use polls? Gee let's see shall we, I can find some polls too! \"Just over half of white voters, 51 percent, say race relations have worsened under Trump, while larger majorities of African-American voters (79 percent) and Hispanics (60 percent) say they have gotten worse.\" <source>: https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/08/trump-race-relations-poll-766395 \"Disapproval of Trump\u2019s handling of race relations is still almost 60 percent\" <source>:https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/23/disapproval-trumps-handling-race-relations-hits-percent/?utm_term=.ac359534cc12 \"New Poll: Majority of Americans Believe Race Relations Have Worsened under President Trump\" <source>: http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/new-poll-majority-of-americans-believe-race-relations-have-worsened-under-president-trump/ \"<Poll>: One year after Charlottesville, majority of Americans see racial tensions on the rise\" <source>:https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-one-year-after-charlottesville-americans-see-racial-tensions-on-increase/ You're a funny one PS your link is from a poll from 2016 lol<BuckinghamHelmet>: Lol you're the funny one. Anyone can find a link to support their view. The fact that I made you work so hard to justify your hate and willingness to blame everything on a single is pure entertainment to me. Do any of those polls take into account the talking heads on TV telling the poll takers that things are worse under Trump? No, they don't. Hence the 2016 link I used from well before the ORANGE MAN BAD herd thinking got too deep. Guess what, a good majority of people will do and think exactly what the screen in front of them tells them to.<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Lol he calls a single google search 'work so hard' and then upon realizing his link is from before orange man he tries to justify it with some shaky logic. Stop trying to blame the media for 'spin' who are you Bill O'Reilly? Race relations are getting worse whether you pull your head out of your ass or not. Would you also deny the rise of white nationalism in recent years?<BuckinghamHelmet>: Who are you, Jim Acosta? Stop trying to to blame all failures on one dude. What people think and what actually is are two different things. Polls show people THINK they are getting worse. Statistics (if you can find unbiased ones) show what IS. <Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Lol, you make it sound like he has no influence over the country. You're clearly living in some fantasy world. If statistics show what Is then take the multiple examples I just gave you and accept the fact that relations between races has gotten worse in the last few years and Trump being in office *is* an exacerbating factor. It's not the only factor, it's not one man causing half the country to *turn* racist, but it is one man with a huge affect on people. But hey, don't take my word for it, go look at all the racist and neo-nazi and white nationalist and white supremacist groups say about Trump. He's on their side, he shares their views. He supports them, remember how there was 'very fine people' on both sides of the tiki torch parade? You know just as well as I do that racists of all kinds feel kin to Trump. They feel emboldened and protected by Trump. They think he's the new leader of the 'white world' and he's gonna make things good for the white man again. Go take a peek in t_d and you can see all the proof you need dude. If you think it's all media spin and brown people complaining then you're just another part of the problem. <BuckinghamHelmet>: I don't think it's all media spin and brown people (racist much?) But that the media, the politics, the lack of communication between people all work together to create problems. If you think one man is responsible for all bad things, you're dumber than I thought.<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: If you had reading comprehension better than a three year old you would have read my last response and saw that I *specifically* said I didn't think Trump was the only cause, like he flipped a switch or something. Instead of just skimming over the words to see if there's a picture, actually read what I'm saying and you might get some education today. fact check: https://www.factcheck.org/2019/03/the-facts-on-white-nationalism/ \"\"In the U.S., far-right extremism has eclipsed violent Salafi jihadists,\" said the centre's director, Brian Levin. \"The difference is white nationalism has emerged into a coalesced and growing socio-political force, with tentacles that extend into the mainstream.

Lmao. <Steve_Danger_Gaming>: What a witty retort, you really dug into the heart of the matter here didn't you? You going to also dismiss CBC? It's funny when you can tell that you've run out of steam and your little brain can't refute the facts so it goes into ad hominem mode. Don't join the debate club kid. <BuckinghamHelmet>: I don't debate because people are fucking retarded. No I didn't miss CBC but the fact that you tell me not to debate after including CNN in your reply tells me your memory is short or you simply don't care about the sources you use so long as they support you by any means necessary.<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Lol that's a bold way of saying you're putting your dick between your legs and slinking away. &amp;#x200B; Racism is up and Trump is a major factor. Live with it<BuckinghamHelmet>: It's the same, and only seems so because the laser focus on it. Live with it.<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: You say that with the confidence of the entirely ignorant. Violence caused by 'white nationalists' is on a noticeable, measurable rise. Numbers don't lie, but you refuse to see the truth because nothing has changed for you. Things are getting worse for people of colour, but you will never see that or believe it. You're part of the problem<BuckinghamHelmet>: Ohh no, you called me part of the problem. I've lost and bow to your superior being /s Bitch please. Your numbers are polls, opinions and nothing more. Things have stayed the same for years. If they are getting worse it's the fault of the individual. Nothing more and nothing less. <Steve_Danger_Gaming>: LOL! You started this out by using a poll as 'proof' against my comment that race relations took a nosedive. Good job going full circle and denouncing your own sources! It's like you're making the arguments for me. First you make a comment, then you prove it wrong yourself. Auto-correct! Things have stayed the same for years huh? How about this straight from the motherfucking FBI. You want sources? This is the best one you're gonna get : <FBI>: Hate crimes in U.S., CA surge in first year of Trump\u2019s presidency<https>://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/FBI-Hate-crimes-in-U-S-CA-surge-in-first-year-13389522.php <BuckinghamHelmet>: Surged. IE, temporary. You are completely wasting your time here, but far be it from me to tell you how to manage yourself. <Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Not temporary, it's continue to rise. Nice try moving the goalposts AGAIN. First you say there's no change, then you say it's only temporary when I prove you wrong. How far are you gonna back up on this? You gonna fight tooth and nail every inch cause you just DONT WANT TO BELIEVE that things are getting worse. This is what you Trumpists call winning isn't it? Just deny any facts that go against your rhetoric and then circle jerk it in T_D right?<BuckinghamHelmet>: Check my post history twatwaffle. Never been there but believe what you want. Yes I will fight you tooth and nail. Hell, put us in a room together and I'd break your nose for pressing on. <Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Lol now you've reduced yourself to name calling and threats of violence. You can't even make a decent argument to support your point and now you want to fight. There was a special class in my school for kids like you<BuckinghamHelmet>: Hardy har har. You can't even check a user before making assumptions. This is why I don't debate. Because stupid people (you) exist. I've got time, let's keep this going.<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Ok, why don't you first address how every point you've tried to make ive refuted and provided my sources. Go ahead and try to provide some proof that racial relations have remained the same or improved since Trump took office? Its not an assumption, you're actively supporting Trump in this thread, are you that dense? So yeah ill be waiting on those numbers that say race relations are the same or better. Also go ahead and try to find some numbers from a legit source that says white nationalist/supremacist/alt-right violence *isn't* on the rise, cause those numbers don't lie. <BuckinghamHelmet>: https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/01/18/americans-more-positive-about-race-relations-year- Your original nosedive claim is bullshit. Kinda hard to find numbers that don't lie when we're having our system inundated with false claims.<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: &gt;Bitch please. Your numbers are polls, opinions and nothing more. &amp;#x200B; That's you, that's your quote. You said that. You fucking moron. Which one is it? You also said I don't care about sources as long as they support my position, now you're cherry picking opinion polls that support your opinion? Dude you've already argued against THIS argument you are now trying to make. Flip flop much? You literally change your stance mid-argument? You've contradicted yourself. Your confused half-baked narrative isn't even consitent?! And even in the article you link it says 39% think..... ## \"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s dream of racial equality has been realized \u2018quite a bit\u2019 today\" &amp;#x200B; **39%**.....'quite a bit'. Wow *slow clap* that's really decisive isn't it? And 39%? I wonder what demographic that was *cough* \" **46.1 percent voted for Donald Trump** \" *cough* . &amp;#x200B; &gt;Kinda hard to find numbers that don't lie when we're having our system inundated with false claims. &amp;#x200B; And there it is folks, straight out of the orange monkey's mouth \"ITS FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS HILLARY EMAILS GAY FROGS BAN MUSLIMS FAKE NEWS MUSLIMS FAKE NEWS BUILD THE WALL FAKE MUSLIM NEWS FROGS FAKE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\" &amp;#x200B; Good job living up to the stereotype<BuckinghamHelmet>: Keep on spamming text walls there pothead. Dumb fucking Canuck.<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Lol he can't think of an argument!!!! Once again attacking my person because you cant support your own position. Oh no you called me a Canuck and a pot head, im so hurt. My precious little feelings! Spend the rest of the day considering this pot head Canuck just took you to school <BuckinghamHelmet>: You did not do shit bitch. Please keep replying though. <Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Because if I keep replying that somehow makes this a win for you? That's the last thing your have to hold on to? Somehow if I keep replying it undoes the thrashing I just gave you? It's nice to know that you've been reduced to some playground style shit. <BuckinghamHelmet>: Because you're emotionally invested in this quite obviously. So anything to rile you up is a win. Which appears to be easy with the way you treat other posters.<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Dude I'm literally sitting here smoking a bong and eating weed gummies and laughing my ass off picturing you sitting there in your mobility scooter with your MAGA hat in your mom's basement with the O'reilly report or fox news in the background. You're popping heart pills like pez and your face is red as a cherry, bulging veins on your forehead, yelling at your Walmart computer. The confederate flag is up in your window blocking out the broken cars on your lawn. You're screaming about how everything's as good as it ever was. You just change the channel every time there's something you don't want to hear don't you? You don't educate yourself, you've already got your opinion and you're not changing it over a little thing like facts<BuckinghamHelmet>: Holy fuck aren't you presumptuous lmao. God I love seeing the dissonance. Person doesn't hate Trump= must be a basement dwelling maga man. Educate myself? After you unbias yourself.<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Lol i love that you don't even deny it. Pound back some more cheetos and mountain dew. Or maybe have a meal fit for the president right from mcdonalds. <BuckinghamHelmet>: Why deny when you won't believe it anyway? I could literally post a picture of my house and family and you would call Photoshop on it then disseminate it to others for harassment purposes. Shit, I could even show the mortgage with my name on it, my DD-214, ribbon board, CDL, Hazmat endorsement, I could give you everything to prove I'm not some failure to launch and you'd still get shit twisted. <Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Wait, you have a house? Shit man I'm sorry, you were right. Trump has unified people of all races, cancer is cured, there's no more homelessness! What the actual fuck is your point? Stop trying to sidetrack and deflect. Race relations are worse since Trump got into office and thats a fact whether you acknowledge it or not. Truth is not dependant on your beliefs<BuckinghamHelmet>: Oh, so now that I've denied a personal attack I'm the one side tracking. Ohh boy your hypocrisy is Rich and delicious.<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Lol i never made any personal attacks, I just described how I imagine you. Please learn English, it might help you win an argument one day. I mean, not soon, but maybe one day<BuckinghamHelmet>: Dude I'm literally sitting here smoking a bong and eating weed gummies and laughing my ass off picturing you sitting there in your mobility scooter with your MAGA hat in your mom's basement with the O'reilly report or fox news in the background.

You don't educate yourself, you've already got your opinion and you're not changing it over a little thing like facts Oh, so none of this complete bullshit lie of a post was meant personally? Nice try. Assuming I have a Confederate battle flag (because I'm pretty sure you're not talking about the actual CSA flag), a MAGA hat, insulting my home, my person, my physique, my properties. None of that was a personal attack? Damn I never would have seen it so clearly had you told me it wasn't personal /s<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: Sorry I know English isn't your first language, let's try this again. I never made a claim you were actually as I described I just said that's how I picture you. Do I need to help you understand the distinction between thoughts and reality? &amp;#x200B; Once again you're sidetracking though. &amp;#x200B; Race relations have gotten worse since Trump entered office. Provide evidence otherwise or just don't bother responding. It's sad at this point<BuckinghamHelmet>: Nah, fuck you I won't do what you tell me <Steve_Danger_Gaming>: You literally can't. That's the whole basis of our argument and YOU CANT. That's a win people, wrap it up lets go home. <BuckinghamHelmet>: Claiming victory without actually winning it? God damn. You're special aren't you?<Steve_Danger_Gaming>: You can't make a counter argument. I've provided evidence with multiple sources and after flip flopping and contradicting yourself you've given up because you've been whipped. Yes I call that a win. I proved my point and you proved your own to be false. Come back when you can support your own argument. Got a come back for that? You literally put forward your opinion and coukdnt support it.

But no charges for the Georgia mother who left a locked, loaded, one in the chamber, safety off handgun exposed in the center console of her car, then left the car - with two kids in it - so the 4 year old could shoot the six year old... Awesome, America.<TitaniumDragon>: &gt; But no charges for the Georgia mother who left a locked, loaded, one in the chamber, safety off handgun exposed in the center console of her car, then left the car - with two kids in it - so the 4 year old could shoot the six year old... Ehhhhhhhhh. The woman could have been charged with child endangerment, but I suspect that the prosecutor just felt really bad for her and felt that her living with the knowledge that her actions had led to the death of her daughter was punishment enough, and that there wasn't any value in locking her up. They probably also judged that the person wouldn't make the same mistake again. Here, the prosecutor probably is feeling a lot less sympathetic. The person in question got drunk off their ass then tried to kill themselves, and managed to kill their girlfriend in the process of doing so. That does fall under depraved-heart murder, and the fact that he was intoxicated and was trying to kill himself in front of his girlfriend does make me feel a lot less sorry for him.<dodadsandwhatsits>: That's not how laws work. I'm sure plenty of people make bad choices they feel remorse for, and that remorse might be due punishment. Screw that garbage all day long.<TitaniumDragon>: Prosecutorial discretion is a thing; if a prosecutor feels that prosecuting someone isn't worth the money or won't lead to a positive outcome or that they won't win a conviction, they won't do it. However, the reality is that there wasn't a crime committed there in the first place. The woman briefly stepped out of her car because the car wouldn't start, and the child got at the gun and shot their sibling with it during that time. That's simply not criminal negligence.<dodadsandwhatsits>: Sure it is. Because there's not way in hell it went down like mommy said. There's no way a kid got out of his restraints, retrieved the gun, fired it in the two seconds she told police he had - she said the car wouldn't start, she got out, heard the shot. So - there's no way it went down like she said unless the kids weren't secure - in a car - that by her own intent to start was going to be moving, and they should have been in restraints... Or if she left them unattended for a lot longer than she said - which is what actually happened, I'm sure. You say it yourself - somehow, after only briefly exiting the car... a matter of moments... And you believe that shit? So - either a chain of irresponsible behavior - kids not in restraints, gun left in the open - with two seconds, depending on the type of gun - possible safety disabled, cocked, one in the chamber... Or she lied about how long they were the car with the gun. Nope, sorry - negligence - criminal negligence - all day. Unsecued tool of death not kept under control, in your possession. If I left my liquor cabinet open, my kids got drunk, got in a car - I'd be responsible. But nope, when it comes to magic guns, the holy solution, the magic tough-guy tool - nope. Just do what you want and make up stories and lie and be weak and never be held accountable. Awesome. You buy her bullshit - I don't. See, I have been around guns - and I know there's no way in hell a 4 year old kid did that in two seconds. And she's still 100% at fault for leaving her gun unattended - ask her just 10 seconds prior to the bang, she'd have told you she's a responsible gun owner. Well, she wasn't - one of her kids is dead - and hell yeah, she was responsible - and negligent - and probably pretty damn dishonest. And if you're gonna lie, it's because you know you did wrong, and if you know you did wrong, it's you admitting you were at fault. No way in hell that kid got to that gun unless she'd made a TON of irresponsible choices. And she should be held accountable for them - because her pathetic values and priorities suck and killed her kid.<TitaniumDragon>: The sickness is inside you. Turn all your anger, hate, and rage inwards. Ask yourself, \"Why do I lie and make up things to get angry about?\" Because, seriously, everything you said was utterly made-up nonsense. 1) Children over the age of 4 typically use booster seats; they are not really \"restrained\" in their seats and can rather easily get out of them. 2) The *detectives* who investigated said that the child got the gun out of the console and fired it. 3) If the woman is around the outside of the car, she is not \"leaving them unattended\". It's entirely normal to not be in the same room as a 4-6 year old child, but you're expected to be nearby. 4) I cannot find \"two seconds\" in any of these articles. 5) Literally everyone involved - the mother and the detectives - agree to what happened, and the police - you know, the *actual experts* - and the prosecutor did not have any reason to bring charges. What's wrong with you? You're making up garbage about other people to justify your twisted world view. What you're saying is potentially *libellous*. I get it - you don't want to take responsibility for your actions, and don't want to admit that your outrage is completely unjustified and that you just make up random nonsense to get outraged over. Outrage culture is toxic and horrible for society.<dodadsandwhatsits>: 1) Still have seat-belts. Still adds to the time it takes to get out of them. 2) So - we're back to the events - kid got out of restraints, moved to range of the console, got the gun... 3) And if you leave a gun... in a room... with kids.... and leave... that's you being stupid, leaving kids with a gun - unattended. 4) You don't have to find where it says it, you have to decide how long it takes you to open your door and move to the hood in reality land and not accept bullshit lies instead. 5) Literally everyone in a lot of places agree crimes don't take place, doesn't mean it doesn't happen. And it's pretty ironic you close with: you don't want to take responsibility for your actions When this is about a mother - who left a tool of death - in a car - with her kids - for long enough for them to get out of their restraints, get the gun, prime it for firing, and fire it... in, yes, two seconds - because momma, the evidence you invoke but can't accept, told the police she got out of the car, heard the shot. Definition unattended: not supervised or looked after Sounds like it fits to me. Gun wasn't supervised. Gun wasn't looked after. Kids weren't supervised in the presence of a gun. Kids weren't looked after in the presence of a gun. A tool of death. That was magically retrieved, primed and fired in the time it took mommy to get out of the car and move towards the hood, based on Mommy's words... Mommy lied and left the kids alone for longer than she said. Deal with it. It's either that, or mommy was so grossly irresponsible it's pathetic. Either way - mommy killed her kid, it's just pathetic America doesn't have any responsible gun owners because we have no way to hold any of them responsible.<TitaniumDragon>: It's amazing how you keep doubling down on your lies. None of the articles say what you desperately need for them to say. Not one of them. Zero. None. Nada. Zippo. They all say that the woman got out of her car and was inspecting it to try and determine what was wrong. At some point after that, she heard the gunshot. An examination to determine what is wrong with your vehicle can take several minutes, especially if you are grabbing anything with which to test stuff (like, say, using something to check the charge on your battery). Anyone who has ever driven a car knows this. There's no mention of \"seconds\", that's just something you made up. What you *desperately* need is for there to be some justification for your outrage. Clearly this person must be filth! After all, otherwise you'd just be some sort of sick sociopathic monster who is trying to blame a woman for the accidental death of a child. What sort of sick person would do that? Literally everyone involved agrees it was an accidental death. The police found no evidence whatsoever to suggest that a crime had occurred. There's zero evidence of criminal negligence. You're about as likely to be struck by lightning as you are to die of an accidental gunshot wound as a child. Shit happens. Is it sad? Sure. Is it criminal? No. Your pathological hatred for this woman is sad.<dodadsandwhatsits>: Official police statement does not say that.<TitaniumDragon>: Where is the official police statement?<dodadsandwhatsits>: Look it up. Brave enough for a trigger, too lazy to google something. Paulding County Sheriff. Have fun.<TitaniumDragon>: I looked it up, I couldn't find it. That's why I asked. All I found was http://www.paulding.gov/DocumentCenter/View/8649/UPDATE-158-Laurelcrest-Lane-6-YO-Child-Shot-PR?bidId= Which doesn't contain any information that wasn't in the news reports. --- On Monday April 8, 2019 at approximately 5:47 PM, Paulding Deputies responded to 158 Laurelcrest Lane Dallas, GA 30132, which is in The Park at Cedarcrest subdivision, reference a child that had been shot. When Deputies arrived on scene they began rendering aid with other first responders to a 6 year old female juvenile that had a gunshot wound to the head. As soon as they were able, Fire and EMS personnel transported her to an Atlanta area hospital. Once Detectives arrived on scene they began speaking with the mother of the children about what took place. Detectives were able to discover that the family was loading up in their vehicle to leave the home when the car would not start. The mother exited the vehicle to see if she could figure out what was wrong with the car and that is when she heard the shot. Detectives determined that the 4 year male sibling retrieved a handgun from the console of the vehicle and accidently discharged it, striking his 6 year old sister in the head, fatally wounding her. This incident took place inside the vehicle in the driveway of the home.<dodadsandwhatsits>: The mother exited the vehicle to see if she could figure out what was wrong with the car and that is when she heard the shot. That is when. She exited the car, that is when. Not \"She exited the car and was examining the engine.\" She exited the car and she heard the shot. Pssst - keep in mind, the other alternative is she left them with an unsecured gun, unattended, for AT LEAST SEVERAL MINUTES - by your words, the guy who can't define unattended honestly, and shot his own arguments in the ass by having to admit she wasn't in the car with the loaded, unsecured gun for long enough for a kid to get out of his belt, get the gun, prime it, fire it.<TitaniumDragon>: You aren't reading it. She exited the vehicle to see what was wrong with it. If someone exits a vehicle to see what is wrong with it, they... exit the vehicle to see what is wrong with it. Then she heard a gunshot. There's no indication of how much time she spent looking at the vehicle to see what was wrong with it. You are making up details that don't exist to justify attacking people.<dodadsandwhatsits>: I read it fine. She exited, heard the shot. Just like the police release says. And if she didn't, it means your assertion - that she left them alone with a tool of death unattended, unsecured - has to be true. Which isn't an accident, it's negligent stupidity. I hope she loses the other kid to a family that will protect it.", "num_messages": 16, "avg_score": 77.5625}

His tech could possibily destroy the data industry. 8kb for a whole movie? You could store a lot of stuff in a 1mb stick. All those data giants won't sit by and watch the data market destroyed and assassinated him. Turns out it was scam. <Garuda1_Talisman>: It's impossible. There are theoretical limits to compression. Imagine you have a point at the coordinates (x,y,z). The total information stored is 3 numbers. No matter which coordinate system you choose, you will **always** need the same amount of information to describe the location of that point (cylindrical would be (r,theta,z) and spherical would be (r,theta,phi)). The only way to compress data is either to lose information or find a new way of expressing that information (ex: if x, y, and z are the same, you could write it as (3x)). But in the end, there is a \"lower bound\" of information, and you cannot go under that lower bound without losing information. There is too much data in a movie to compress in under 8kB. I myself have a compressed version of Shrek and at 4FPS/160p with maximum compression (you can barely understand a thing) it holds at ~45MB.<scubasteave2001>: Not going to flat out say you are wrong. It\u2019s just it seems like every time anyone has said that x is impossible, some one comes around not too much later and not only proves that x is in fact possible but also very easy to do. They say it\u2019s impossible to move information faster than the speed of light, then they talk about possible technology\u2019s that would let you move from point a to point b faster than a light particle could but also not break that speed limit. It\u2019s all about bending laws and finding loopholes. Not breaking the limits and laws. <BlindPaintByNumbers>: Please see the answer where the guy shows that there are more frames in a movie than there are bits in 8 kb<scubasteave2001>: There is also a picture of the original super Mario brothers game that is a larger file than the entire original game. <BlindPaintByNumbers>: I'm not sure what your point is?

Most scientific theories are initially brushed off as impossible. Your assertion that you can store an entire video frame worth of information in a single **bit** proves that you don't even have the smallest understanding of what the discussion was about and are not in any way qualified to express a theory about it.

Kinda like how they don\u2019t own the literal concentration camps that FDR threw Japanese citizens into <danki5000>: Not denying history at all- you are. You are denying that both parties went through fundamental shifts since the civil war and have essentially swapped conservative and progressive philosophies, and to draw a modern parallel is entirely disingenuous. You know it, but spew your bullshit anyways, and play dumb and loud because thats the only road you have.<JPSchmeckles>: I know you guys have worked hard to absolve yourself of your racist history. Concentration camps KKK Segregation Opposing the civil rights act \u201cThey switched!!!\u201d Is a meme at this point with no substance. <danki5000>: It\u2019s not a meme at all- it\u2019s history and it happened. It\u2019s baffling to me how ignorant- or possibly willfully obtuse you are. What\u2019s it like in your world, where history and nuance don\u2019t matter? Sounds like a sad place<JPSchmeckles>: It really didn\u2019t. But Reddit keeps saying so so it must be true. When did the switch happen? Congressional seats in the south were mostly Democrat held until the 90\u2019s. So when did this magicial switch happen? Was FDR a Democrat do you claim him?<danki5000>: Dude holy shit, you are arguing like it\u2019s team vs team or something. Yes FDR was a Democrat- that doesn\u2019t mean the parties havent undergone fundamental shifts over the last 150 years- or that either side is absolved of any of its sins. You are seriously pitiful- arguing against no one because you\u2019re too scared to face reality.<JPSchmeckles>: So the democrats are the party of the KKK, segregation, concentration camps, opposing the civil rights act. Glad we can agree. <danki5000>: Yes southern democrats held political majority in TN (and every other traitorous state) in 1865 when the KKK was created. Concentration camps in America were initiated by a democratic president, but were backed almost unanimously by both sides (truly abhorrent and disgusting time for American history.) Segregation was also enacted by democrats in the south, again before the fundamental shift in parties. The civil rights movement is far more complex than its voting records show, but is still an abhorrent and shameful part of history for all American politics. Would it mess up your narrative to inform you a democratic president signed the 1964 civil rights act into law? Again, no one besides you is arguing history didn\u2019t happen. Yes- the Democratic Party of the past is guilty of those things- but the parties have essentially flipped their stances, and racists traitors who seceded from the union would fall in line with modern Republican views (small government, less regulation and taxation). That was my initial point you dolt, and it shows you clearly don\u2019t care what history has to Teach us- it\u2019s just a plaything you can twist to help make your ridiculous arguments that avoid both nuance and subtlety. The American education system has failed you.<JPSchmeckles>: When did this magical flip happen? Reagan carried 49 states in the 80\u2019s. Jimmy Carter did fantastically in the south. Georgia didn\u2019t elect a republican governor until 2002. When did this happen? If the KKK decided to take on modern leftist progressive ideals would you join? Because you clearly have no problem being a Democrat. <danki5000>: Since you apparently refuse to do your own research into history, here is a few articles on the topic <http>://factmyth.com/factoids/democrats-and-republicans-switched-platforms/ <https>://www.chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2010/05/20/when-and-to-an-extent-why-did-the-parties-switch-places/ And heres an academic article: <http>://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/reversal2.pdf And heres a voting map for you to actually look with your own eyes: <https>://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/ I am not a democrat, just someone who actually pays attention to history.

This is just liberals trying to make excuses to try and pawn off their own racist past. You can argue they changed but they still own their history.

They don\u2019t get to play revisionist history and say they aren\u2019t. <danki5000>: Well you asked 1 question, not \"questions\" there- but Ill answer it anyways. 1) No not at all, as Im not a racist. Nor do I pigeon-hole myself intellectually into a \"political party\" because Im not a sheep. I do, and would condemn the KKK.

Both World Wars were some of the most horrific campaigns of slaughter the world has seen, from all sides, and the truly horrifying thing about the holocaust was never that it killed 17 million people, since 56 million civilians alone were murdered over the course of the second world war, it was how organized it was.

I've grown a lot and gotten a lot better at reading people, feeling their emotions, and being empathetic. The being hyper-aware of my own issues as well as dumb decisions/inconsiderate people and what have you is something I deal with almost every moment i'm out of the house. Driving, at a concert, at work, wherever people can be inconsiderate dicks. It would be a lot easier to enjoy myself if I wasn't in my head talking shit or psychoanalyzing them to try and empathize with why they're such a stupid piece of shit. I used to be pretty hard on how I critiqued people, but as i've gotten older i've gotten better at considering their life and reality and how it's shaped what they're good at and how they feel. My skills and opinions aren't some defined standard of excellence, I just have my own experiences and skills that made me like I am. Sometimes though I really wish I could tune that out and let it go. Being mindful is a lot of work, but it's the solution to 99% of the things I see day to day that leave me anxious and frustrated with people.<I_am_the_flower_lord>: Hello from the other side. As long as I remember, I didn't have emotions, and I had to learn to feel them. Not just in a way \"you don't know what is it called\". I didn't have them, I still think I don't, but I grew up learning them from observation. I still don't understand much about humans, emotions and relationships, it's almost like I'm an alien - but I started to imitate them a few years ago, and I think I started to \"feel\" them properly when I think I should. Hence the \"hello\" from the beginning. I sometimes wish I could feel emotions like every other human, and be angry or sad because someone did something, and understand that others are feeling too, and they have their motives driven from that. Instead I'm just there, and if I do \"get emotional\" it's the most logical way of being emotional you could ever imagine (besides very few sudden \"outings\" of bad emotions like sadness or anger, but it's usually half an hour long at max, mostly under 5 minutes, followed by total \"PC mode\", as my bf calls that). I understand that other people feel, and their feelings are stronger than mine, but I can't really understand why someone would, for instant, bully someone, if they knew that bullying is \"bad\". I don't understand hate to the point of torture or murder, and I don't understand love to the point of stalking or not taking a \"no\" for an answer. I don't understand petty revenges, shame from sudden memory of an embarrassing situation, or laughing at bad jokes. I'd like to, though.

Government is the one who unceremoniously decided all of them were illegal and overnight made them controlled substances. Government is also the single largest offerer of funds for \"studying\" substances. Bit of a bias in play there. &gt;Prohibition kills way more people than decriminalization and legalization ever could. So we agree Government is at the core of the issue as it currently stands? Because this whole \"Zero Tolerance\" policy means the average every day person gets _fucked_ because people who study states of altered consciousness like myself are treated like worse than shit because we dare to use the \"illegal\" drugs. We could heal the world from this wound overnight if Government took its dick out of the fucking pudding already so we could wash the bowl and try again.<550456>: You know, just because you disagree with the law doesn't give you the right to break it.<myfingid>: Exactly. If the law tells you to report your neighbors for being Jewish or to return escaped slaves to their rightful owners, you damn well better do it! Morality be damned, the law is the law!<550456>: I didn't say you couldn't work to change the law, and being unable to take part in a recreational activity is nowhere near the same as destroying basic human rights like the analogy you use. Nice try putting words in my mouth though, you really got me<myfingid>: I'm just saying that \"the law is the law\" and similar phrases are meaningless statements often used to justify government punishing people for reasons that may or may not make sense. It's a pointlessly phrase often uttered by people who want others to be punished but cannot justify the reasons to do so other than \"the law is the law\". Such phrases are still used to continue pointless laws passed which pass for reasons that don't really add up (often due to racism or to make people feel somehow safer). The prohibition on marijuana and strange knife laws that vary state to state are great examples of this, and punishments for both are often justified with \"the law is the law\". Telling people who live under threat of government punishment for actions that are not violent to \"just go change the law\" adds further insult to the injustice of having to deal with pointless laws and the punishment they bring. &amp;#x200B; If there's a valid argument for something then make it, stating that people should just follow the law is bullshit. The law is nothing more than a series of decrees put out by a government stating that it will take your money, property, freedom, life, etc, for violating such decrees. It has no morality, and stating that it should be blindly followed is what leads to individuals trampling over human rights. When the law pushes to far it should not be respected. The fact that it exists means nothing when it comes to what is right and what is just. &amp;#x200B; That's why these \"law is the law\" dismissive statements piss me off. At best they justify annoyances but at worst they justify human tragedy simply because someone or some body of people made a decree.<550456>: Alright well if you want to really get philosophical about it, consider this. Ethics and morality, which may have clear definitions and rules to you, may have very different definitions to someone else. Just because you think your way is best or right doesn't mean that it is, because really there's no objective right or wrong. Even shit that Hitler did, while I personally find it atrocious, can't be objectively called right or wrong, because why is one person's morality somehow better than another's? All that to say: you feeling that something is wrong or unjust doesn't make it so, and if we go around telling people that they can ignore the rules that society sets down because they feel like they should be able to, there's nothing to stop some guy with anger issues from beating the shit out of you because of some perceived slight. Now, granted, that's not a perfect analogy and there's a lot of wiggle room there, but I think the point should be clear that morality is very subjective. This is why laws are important, and why you can't just go cherry-picking which ones you want to follow. Now of course, some societies have enforced laws in the past where they infringed on what we generally consider to be basic human rights, but here, in this particular context, we are fortunate enough to live in a country where we have rights set down that can't be infringed upon. So that's not really an issue here. I think it's fairly clear why we can't just let people break the law, no matter how reasonable or right it might seem to those people at the time. If you want to go ahead and do it, that's up to you, but you can't really complain when you get punished for it (you might complain about what that punishment is, but that's a whole new topic). It's like when you're a child and your parents tell you no sweets before dinner because you'll spoil your appetite. If you were anything like me, you thought to yourself \"well I'll just make sure to eat all my dinner anyway, so I won't spoil it\" and then maybe you tried to sneak some candy anyway. Should the parent in this case just be okay with it, or should they punish the child for disobeying? If you were a parent and your kid did that, would you be okay with it? Again, this isn't a perfect metaphor, but I think it gets the point across<myfingid>: I understand that morality differs. I'm stating that the law is not morality, and that saying is that \"the law is the law\" isn't a justification for a law. If a law cannot be justified for reasons other than \"it's the law\" then it should be repealed and at best should not be followed. It's a pointless thing to say and to use it a justification for the existence of a law can lead to very bad things. As for children and parents, who cares? We're talking about government here. At no point should anyone view the government with a parent-child relationship. Government is a necessary yet dangerous tool which has lead to the deaths of hundreds of millions through war, genocide, and injustice. We need to treat its actions and laws in a more serious manner. It should not care is people do something as harmless as sneak food or otherwise ingest things and allowing it to do so can easily lead to abuses as innocent people are locked up for non-violent acts. The more you allow government to control the daily life of those it rules the more you open it up to abuse its own people.<550456>: I get the sense that no matter what I say you're going to disagree because it means you don't get to do drugs. But I'll give it one last shot. The laws in question *can* be justified by other reasons (for example, drug abuse often leads to behavior that puts people around them in danger), but my point is that just because you disagree with those reasons is not sufficient justification for breaking the law. As for the parent-child relationship, like I said, it's not a perfect metaphor. But the idea of setting rules and discipline for not following them is very similar. If the parent shouldn't allow their children to disobey for no other reason than that they wanted to, why should our legal system?<myfingid>: It's not a want to do drugs. Marijuana is legal in my state, so if I wanted to do the one drug other than alcohol or nicotine that I'd want to do, I could. What I have a problem with is people not taking the law seriously. The law is enforced with violence and coercion. If we're going to pass a law we need to be certain that it is worth it, that people can potentially lose their livelihood if not their lives over their actions. We can't just use violence and coercion to try to force people to live in the way 'society' believes best, nor should we even try. &amp;#x200B; Going back to fighting drug use/addiction, the law is a terrible way to go about it. Locking people up and going so far as to mark them as felons helps no one. I don't see how using violence and coercion to take from people who have little to nothing because they are using/addicted to something is a necessary use of the law. Further it has created a black economy that has proven to be extremely destructive and manipulative. We need to look at better solutions. I believe a system to help people get over addiction would be a much better use of our time and resources and have a better outcome. However this gets us into healthcare and that's unfortunately a whole other can of worms fought with waste, fraud, abuse, and the horrible justification of limiting people to save money.<550456>: Forcing people to live in the way that \"society\" believes best is really what society is all about. That's why laws exist, so that we can all live in relative peace and safety. I vaguely remember a philosophical argument that talks about how even this is a violation of our freedom to an extent, but as it stands now that's the trade-off we make to avoid anarchy. As for the current system of dealing with it, I won't try to say that the current system is perfect by any means, but I definitely wouldn't say it doesn't help anyone. It may not help those people who are already addicts, and I agree that rehabilitation should be better for them, but can you really say that there aren't people who never did drugs because of the legal consequences they knew they might face? I'd say it helped those people<myfingid>: Society trying to force others to live in the way they see best has lead to mass slaughter and enslavement on a regular basis through out history. That is why people need to think critically about government and its role. We can do better. If we continue with tribalism and \"us vs them\" bullshit we're going to continue to kill, chain, and otherwise screw up innocent people who are just trying to live, as we all are. We can do better than using force to thrust our clearly right opinions onto others. All forcing or restricting people does is create resentment and separation, and it leads to bad things happening that we often look back on decades or centuries later and say \"yeah that was really fucked up\".<550456>: You think this is a new idea? Why do you think our country runs on elected officials? A government \"by the people, for the people\". It's not perfect by any means, and I won't try to say that there isn't any corruption, but that's literally the whole point of structuring it this way. So that people can come to a general consensus on what is best, through voting. But if you don't agree with the way the vote goes, that doesn't give you leave to break whatever law comes from it. And it's when you break the law that you get punished for it.<myfingid>: I get that's how the law works, but it doesn't justify the law.<550456>: Maybe not, but your opinion on it doesn't make it unjust either.

Do you hate yourself? I can\u2019t possibly fathom what it must be like to have the pleasure center of my brain wired so that I get off on other peoples discomfort. That probably makes you hate yourself even more right? Because a part of you knows it is wrong. You don\u2019t have to be this way, but you choose it because you get off on hating yourself. Because feeling something is better than feeling nothing at all. I\u2019m sure you have been anxiously awaiting my response because it has taken me so long to write this up. You probably thought I gave up and you said \u201cI win\u201d to yourself but when you see that I\u2019ve responded you will get even more pleasure, because you will see that you have riled me up enough to write this fucking essay. Congratulations. Do you feel fulfilled now? Are you happy? Do you finally feel that feeling you so desperately crave? Do you love yourself now? I hope so, because this isn\u2019t a way to live. It\u2019s fucking sad and when you finally graduate middle school and learn how to be a real person you will realize that you are actual human garbage, and instead of hating yourself and wallowing in your self pity you can actually change yourself for the better.<dakotathehuman>: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02<toonytoon180>: You make cry-laugh emojis because you can\u2019t actually laugh or cry because you are not a real person.

Good book.<you_bastid>: This, along with the Milgram Experiment and the Stanford Prison Experiment are some really telling social tests that show how easy it is to exploit the evil side of the human psyche.<ThisTimeIsNotWasted>: Stanford yes, Milgram no. If you look into criticisms of the first Milgram experiments and the constraints put on the follow up study, it casts the conclusions into some super serious doubt. <Edit>: Shit, not even Stanford.<Kckpclean>: Yeah the Stanford study was extremely flawed and didnt really lend any credence to what he was trying to demonstrate. It was good in that it made people talk about it and perform further experiments but it was about as terrible of a study as you could get.<you_bastid>: It made people think it was ok to beat and torture people...but I\u2019m interested in hearing what the flaws were.<Kckpclean>: Yeah it did have an undeniable effect on its participants, but I'm criticizing its scientific validity. Firstly Zimbardo involved himself in the experiment, which is a big no-no because it encourages the participants to act in the way they know Zimbardo wants them to act. Second, participants were prepped on their roles beforehand meaning they had preconceptions of what their behavior was supposed to be. Third, there's some questioning of if some of the participants were coached to act in certain ways in order to beef up the experiments outcome. There's been numerous articles condemning the experiment and its validity but I don't have the links off hand. Fourth, they've been unable to replicate the study. <Edit>: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1475725714568007 Here's an online article. The article I read specifically was in a textbook that I dont have anymore.<Psilocybin_Tea_Time>: It was a flawed experiment, yes. That doesn't discredit the findings. The experiment was, and is, controversial. Also regardless of if they fit into their roles there was fallout. Some of the inmates carried psychological trauma stemming from the experiment throughout their lives. Lastly the only reason it couldn't be replicated is for this reason: &gt;\"The Stanford Prison Experiment is frequently cited as an example of unethical research. The experiment could not be replicated by researchers today because it fails to meet the standards established by numerous ethical codes, including the Ethics Code of the American Psychological Association.\" [-Source](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-stanford-prison-experiment-2794995) [Further reading that documents the events](https://www.prisonexp.org/the-story)<Frothpiercer>: &gt; It was a flawed experiment, yes. That doesn't discredit the findings. Yes, it actually does very much.<Psilocybin_Tea_Time>: So Freud is not taught in psychology at all then?<Frothpiercer>: \"Freud\" is not taught in psychology, some of his work is though. But that is definitely an apples vs oranges logic you are trying to fit there as this \"experiment\" was an abortion made up to be something it was not by people grasping onto something they hope will reaffirm their own ideas on human nature.<Psilocybin_Tea_Time>: Psychology is a little less cut and dry as the Sciences. Scientific laws are generalizable, but psychological explanations are often restricted to specific times and places. Because psychology studies (mostly) people, it studies (indirectly) the effects of social and cultural changes on behavior. Psychology does not go on in a social vacuum. Behavior changes over time, and over different situations. These factors, and individual differences, make research findings reliable for a limited time only. Are traditional scientific methods appropriate for studying human behavior? When psychologists operationalize their IV, it is highly likely that this is reductionist, mechanistic, subjective, or just wrong. Operationalizing variables refer to how you will define and measure a specific variable as it is used in your study. For example, a bio psychologist may operationalize stress as an increase in heart rate, but it may be that in doing this we are removed from the human experience of what we are studying. The same goes for causality. Experiments are keen to establish that X causes Y, but taking this deterministic view means that we ignore extraneous variables, and the fact that at a different time, in a different place, we probably would not be influenced by X. There are so many variables that influence human behavior that it is impossible to control them effectively. The issue of ecological validity ties in really nicely here. Objectivity is impossible. It is a huge problem in psychology, as it involves humans studying humans, and it is very difficult to study the behavior of people in an unbiased fashion. Moreover, in terms of a general philosophy of science, we find it hard to be objective because we are influenced by a theoretical standpoint (Freud is a good example of this). The observer and the observed are members of the same species are this creates problems of reflectivity. A behaviorist would never examine a phobia and think in terms of unconscious conflict as a cause, just like Freud would never explain it as a behavior acquired through operant conditioning. This particular viewpoint that a scientist has is called a Paradigm (Kuhn, 1970). Kuhn argues that most scientific disciplines have one predominant paradigm that the vast majority of scientists subscribe to. Anything with several paradigms (e.g. models \u2013 theories) is a pre-science until it becomes more unified. With a myriad of paradigms within psychology, it is not the case that we have any universal laws of human behavior, and Kuhn would most definitely argue that psychology is not a science. Verification (i.e. proof) may be impossible. We can never really, truly prove a hypothesis, we may find results to support it until the end of time, but we will never be 100% confident that it is really true. It could be disproved at any moment. The main driving force behind this particular grumble is Karl Popper, the famous philosopher of science and advocator of falsificationism. Take the famous Popperian example hypothesis: \"All swans are white\". How do we know for sure that we will not see a black, green or hot pink swan in the future? So even if there has never been a sighting of a non-white swan, we still haven't really proven our hypothesis. Popper argues that the best hypotheses are those which we can falsify - disprove. If we know something is not true, then we know something for sure. <Testability>: much of the subject matter in psychology is unobservable (e.g. memory) and therefore cannot be accurately measured. The fact that there are so many variables that influence human behavior that it is impossible to control the variables effectively.

Also this is about Weber, I just made the point that a broken clock can be right twice a day. <Panzerkampfpony>: A broken clock can be right twice a day, but this isn't Axis-sympathiser writing about tank production or air plane engines, its an Axis-sympathiser writing pro Axis articles, its pure propaganda and should be treated as such. As for his Dresden book, his main source was a Nazi general who provided no sources or evidence for his claim and the other sources he outright lied about.<Kiru-Kokujin36>: We're talking about Weber right now not Irving, as for the article I linked it has sources about it's claims about Japan's attempts to surrender and US knowledge of it.<Panzerkampfpony>: As for the Axis apologist article on the Neo-Nazi website. It deliberately tries to present the IJA and imperial government as being denied peace in exchange for the Emperor's safety. Rather than the reality of the militarists wanting to hold onto their empire and maintain their rule of Japan. A position they were so strongly entrenched in that they tried staging a coup after the second bomb to keep fighting. I don't understand your need to continually try to present the Axis Powers as the victims of undue aggression and Fascist Japan as being on the receiving end of disproportionate attack compared to what they inflicted on the populations of other countries. <Kiru-Kokujin36>: Japan wasn't fascist. Japan did make attempts to surrender that the US ignored. Targeting civilians is a war crime<Panzerkampfpony>: It was clearly Fascist, as similar to Hilter's Germany as it was to Mussolini's Italy or Franco's Spain, any minor distinctions between all of those are irrelevant. The Japanese military offered a ceasefire with Japan keeping its Asian territories and letting letting it's leaders get of scott free, akin to making piece with Hitler and letting him keep eastern Europe. None of the war criminals in either Japan or Germany were charged with the bombing of cities, it wasn't a crime by the definitions of any of the countries involved. Murdering prisoners of war, institutionalised torture of PoWs and civilians, using plague warfare against civilians, using banned chemical weapons, using slave labour and comfort women, human experimentation (Unit 731), cannibalism, faking surrenders and starting wars of aggression are. the IJA committed crimes that would make the Nazis wince. Japan's Fascists were cut from the exact same cloth as the Nazis or the Italian Fascists . A fascist is a Fascist. Doesn't matter what country he is from, the only good fascist is a very dead fascist.<Kiru-Kokujin36>: It wasn't fascist, learn what fascism is, far right does not equate to fascism. No reputable person consider Imperial Japan fascist. &gt;The Japanese military offered a ceasefire with Japan keeping its Asian territories and letting letting it's leaders get of scott free, akin to making piece with Hitler and letting him keep eastern Europe. This is false and even if it were true it's a false equivalence. <http>://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_Weber.html &gt;None of the war criminals in either Japan or Germany were charged with the bombing of cities Not sure about Germany but Japan never bombed civilian cities en masse.

She was also a really big part of my therapy before I learned to ID my emotions; her reactions to me clued my therapist in. Doggos are the goodest.<LeeDoverwood>: I'm wondering now if nightmares are also related to child hood abuse. I was taken from my mother twice for abuse issues. The second time she never tried to get me back. The nightmares only began after I became an adult and persisted for about ten years. Really horrible stuff that made me wake up with my heart racing. Or, my mind would start racing after I went to bed and I would have to get up because I was reliving things that happened when I was a kid.<ghostfacespillah>: My CPTSD actually comes from childhood trauma/abuse, and nightmares are usually my biggest indicator that I need to dial down my stress levels. I'm sorry you're dealing with that. I had a lot of success with EMDR... I can almost sleep like a normal person again.<LeeDoverwood>: Ah. I understand. The abuse didn't really end when my Grandparents won custody, it just didn't happen so often. The first time my grandparents had custody was when I was an infant and being neglected. My parents got back together, got off the booze and got me back. It was not good from the start. By then I had come to think of my Grandparents as my parents and was well adjusted and happy. First I knew of the change of custody was when my dad showed up and angrily demanded I be handed over to him. My grandparents brought me out and wanted to hold me for a bit and say good bye. My dad started shouting and was being verbally aggressive while my Grandparents tried to ask him to take it slow as I didn't know who he was. Mostly I remember him shouting. They handed me over to him and I was terrified, worked loose and ran off and hid under my bed. He was allowed to chase after me and drag me out bawling my head off. From there things went down hill with my own parents alternating between ignoring me and being abusive. Not my dad so much because so far as he was concerned, just owning me was the main point. It was my mother who was paranoid and physically abusive. When I was finally returned to my Grandparents it was like I never fit in again and was never fully loved or protected. Anyone in the family could beat me and frequently did with no consequences, no matter what I did right it was either ignored or misrepresented. Do good, no one cares. Make a mistake, get beat. Try to defend myself, get more beatings. Lash out in frustration and anger, get more beatings. I never realized how abnormal it all was until I began telling a child hood friend about all the secret stuff in our family. The reason I just told it all was because he idolized my Grandmother as some church lady who could do no wrong. For years I had dreams of my older brother beating the shit out of me and didn't understand this. One night while having this frequent dream I decided to fight back and kicked his ass really bad. Just beat the shit out of him. Those dreams stopped after that.<PositiveBlossom>: That's so messed up dude, I'm sorry no one stepped in and helped u. But good for u kicking his ass, I'm glad them nightmares have stopped. Take care of yourself.<LeeDoverwood>: The ass kicking I gave him unfortunately happened in my dreams only. Later on I allowed myself to get sucked back into family politics because, well, we all want to be loved by our family, right? I basically ignored my family for years before I let them contact me again. Weirdly, my brother was the most persistent and annoying. I figured, now that we were all adults he may have matured. That turned out to be a mistake that went badly for me. He ended up assaulting me, filing false charges to protect himself and I ended up in jail with both him and his wife signing off on false police reports. Of course I was angry so I resolved this time to really play hard ball. I called up some of the family and let them know that I fully intended to reveal his entire history in court and really shame the DA for going after me. They were going to find on their side of the table a \"victim\" who terrorized me starting with attempting to kill me when I was five. Abusing me throughout my child hood and attempting to blow up a police station. Many DUI convictions, drug abuse, pedophilia abuse, stalking abuse, and more petty offenses. A convicted felon. My public defender was outraged when my brother dropped all charges and recanted his allegations. Now why would my public defender be pissed off? I told him it was a huge pack of lies. Why? Because he planned to sell me out to the prosecutor and I just pulled the rug out from under him. Since then I have firmly resolved to have nothing to do with my entire family. Severing any ties to my brother was my first step. Later other family members involved in drugs had another go at me with more false charges when I refused to turn a blind eye to criminal behavior but same as previously when I offered to tell all to the DA everything fell apart for them when all charges were dropped. My new best policy: Just avoid these fucked up people as it never ends well for me. I make my unrelated friends my family. They know I am one of the most loyal friends they can have and I expect the same in return.<PositiveBlossom>: Holy crap, 100% stay away from them, break the cycle and make your own happy family. Shocking that so many family members are involved or didnt step in, shame on them. You must be a strong person to get yourself away from that, and to keep on going after all that. Stay strong dude. And also your solicitor trying to fuck u over too! it's a fucking harsh world.<LeeDoverwood>: &gt; And also your solicitor trying to fuck u over too! it's a fucking harsh world. Oh, yes, that was a huge revelation for me and it happened repeatedly with different public defenders. Before my grandparents died I had come to their rescue against some meth addict relatives who were camping out on their ranch estate and they wanted to evict them. We did get the job done but I had to work hard to keep my grandparents from giving up. During that time I ended up facing three false charges with the meth freaks lying and backing each other up. What I didn't realize right away is that the cops were counseling the meth freaks who were also raising pot in the hills. During one arrest, as they hauled me away on a false charge of felony weapons possession, (I'm not a felon, so it did get tossed out eventually) I commented to the police that I highly suspected this was payback for getting the fake assault charge tossed out of court. I further commented that when I was released in a couple days I would be searching out their growing plot and destroying it. One of the cops sneered at me that I was too late as the pot had already been harvested. Me: \"Oh, I see, interesting you would know when that happened\". Both cops got very quiet and didn't speak to me after that. The police also sabotaged my grandparents front gate and were seen doing it. I found their tracks there which led me to ask the neighbors. One public defender who tried to sell me out to the DA I refused to go along with and threatened to fire the entire office. Both him and his associate turned pale so I made a deal with the associate that if she would defend me and break her loyalty to the prosecutor I would let her stay on. They promoted her to the DA the next day and dropped charges. They simply refused to let my case come to trial as I dearly wished to have my day in court. I wanted them slammed in the courtroom. In total, dealing with my relatives I had four charges thrown out of court with out ever getting a trial. After that was all over I had some long thinking to do and came to a hard conclusion. My family is so toxic and dysfunctional they would get me into problems repeatedly. Best solution, divorce myself from anything involving any of my relatives. It's harsh, but had to be done. I also got married about this time and within a few months separated from my wife. I sued for an annulment and did win that but lost all my household goods. I caught my attorney conspiring with my wife's attorney to extort a divorce agreement from me by promising to give me back all my personal property. When I confronted her on the extortion crime she went right to him behind closed doors and warned him that I was planning to press charges of extortion. I literally read her lips through a sound proof window and saw what she was saying. Fun fact, I'm a structural welder. We work in high noise areas and can't hear each other so over the years we learn to lip read. By no means are we experts at it but it's part of our job skill we just pick up. Well, thinking I had no tangible proof of the extortion since it had all been verbal I let it go but interestingly enough, my attorney quit trying to get me to agree to a divorce and went full on board for an annulment which I won based on all the evidence of fraud by my wife. Just a month ago while disposing of all my old papers which I browsed through as I tossed them I found a letter from her attorney with the extortion plan spelled out. All my personal belongings to be returned to me in exchange for my agreement to a divorce. Unfortunately I think the statute of limitations has run out. Anyway, there you have it. Never trust police, messed up family members, District attorney, or even your own attorney. The one attorney who did agree to work honestly with me to defend me they promoted to District Attorney the day after I had a conference with her. She did let go a huge bombshell though. The entire scam to fuck me over while I was defending my grandparents came from relatives.", "num_messages": 9, "avg_score": 313.3333333333}

The prohibition of recording devices could be easily overcome; just say \"only court-allowed recording devices\". Another issue too: Audio recordings are not transcripts. They are up for debate. A transcript isn't. \"This is what was said\" is different from \"This sounds like they said\".

Don't get me wrong here I am not trying to be flippant, I have been in (what I assume) to be a similar mental state; long term contemplating suicide on a daily basis, and yet after all these years I haven't killed myself. Then I have to ask myself, well, why?<KeepGettingBannedSMH>: &gt; Then I have to ask myself, well, why? Did you never try?<GirtabulluBlues>: Intentionally? Only once as a young adult, obviously ineptly. On one hand longer history of self abuse is what ultimately resulted, justified by the realization that I don't care for my existence. On the other hand having the freedom to kill myself if I choose and *not doing so* provides, I have come to find, a quiet and and returning affirmation of myself.<KeepGettingBannedSMH>: &gt; On the other hand having the freedom to kill myself if I choose and not doing so provides, I have come to find, a quiet and and returning affirmation of myself. That's the problem for people who have tried and failed to commit suicide - unlike you I'm not confident I'll have any more success if I re-attempt than I did last time. I tried to hang myself when I was 16 or so; I had the noose around my neck and all I had to do was let myself drop. But leading up to and within that moment I experienced *visceral* fear unlike I'd ever felt or have felt since, and I'm very confident that I'd be unable to commit suicide if it involved overcoming that level of fear again. Non-suicidal people tend to vastly underestimate the difficulty of suicide. This bias is probably a subconscious defence mechanism, because the idea that suicide is easy means that people feel like they have the choice (as you do) to opt out if the going gets too hard for them, placing an upper bound on the level of suffering they'd ever be forced to endure. This, in turn, makes it a lot easier to bear whatever suffering they're presently forced to endure. There was a study done back in 1969 where they got a bunch of people (split into a control and experimental group) to sit in a room for an hour while loud, cacophonous sounds played. The experimental group, however, had a button put in the middle of the room and were told they could press that button at any time to abort early if they wanted. None of the experimental group did press the button, and the button wasn't wired up anyway, but just having the *belief of control* meant that the experimental group were far less unsettled after that hour than the control group. It's a similar principle with scratching your nails down the blackboard - it bothers everyone else in the room except you because you know you're in control of the negative stimulus and can stop at any time. A person who tries to commit suicide and fails learns to appreciate just how difficult suicide actually is, and often ends up in a worse state than they were before since now that illusion of control is stripped from them. I feel like I'm trapped, because I know how hard it is to die and I would have to endure an enormous amount of suffering before the terror of life managed to outweigh the terror of death. And that sucks.<GirtabulluBlues>: Ah well I have also experienced it... ah, unintentionally. When your nihilistic and hedonistic actions lead, unsurprisingly, to your body shutting down under the stress. Making one big decision to kill yourself is *hard*, no doubt about it, but making a series of small short term choices that lead inevitably to your suffering and possible death? Ridiculously easy. But the difficulty in actually *choosing* to die is not some abstract thing that is separable from your own self, it is integral. That is *why* it is valuable as a personal test and limit to the suffering you will tolerate. You are *still* always free to do what you want in any given instance. There are many methods of suicide which don't require preparation or are technically difficult to execute; and yet you are still here, talking to me, not even technically about suicide but *around* it. That should tell you something, I think.<KeepGettingBannedSMH>: &gt; There are many methods of suicide which don't require preparation or are technically difficult to execute; and yet you are still here, talking to me, not even technically about suicide but around it.

Gaslighting is a systematic and conscious effort to distort a persons reality to the point that they think they are going crazy. It will involve lying but lying, by itself, is not gaslighting.<EasternShade>: Yes, the goal in the original movie was to drive the person insane, but insanity is not the goal for gaslighting in most relationships. In terms of relationship abuse, the goal is to get the victim to take the abuser's word over their own perceptions or recollection, which requires some doubt in their experience of reality.<oversoul00>: In my opinion that is too easily conflated with regular lying. All liars want to &gt; get the victim to take the abuser's word over their own perceptions or recollection So is all lying gaslighting then and if so why do we need the new term? The difference in my mind is a conscious and concerted effort to distort that persons reality as the goal rather than a means to an end.<EasternShade>: &gt;So is all lying gaslighting then and if so why do we need the new term? Not all lying is gaslighting. Gaslighting generally involves lying, but there's more. \"Where were you?\" \"I was definitely not out murdering orphans.\" This is lying. \"Why are you wearing lipstick?\" \"I gave mouth to mouth and saved a woman.\" This is lying. \"You said you were going to take out the trash.\" \"No, *you* said you'd take out the trash so I could rest.\" This is gaslighting. \"This is the third time this month you've done this.\" \"I haven't done this for months.\" This is gaslighting. Lying is about obscuring or refuting the truth. Gaslighting is about rewriting their understanding of the truth and replacing it. The difference between providing an alternative explanation and overwriting an explanation.<oversoul00>: I disagree slightly. If we are calling those one offs gaslighting I think the term loses much of its intended sting. If you've ever been in an angry argument with someone you've probably distorted events in your favor or they have and I think it would be a mistake to call that anything other than lying. If it's systematic, then yes I agree with your examples but it can't be an occasional angry argument sort of thing, it has to be happening so often that you doubt yourself on the regular. Another reason I think it has to be systematic is because people frequently remember things wrong, just because our versions of an event are different doesn't mean anyone gaslit anyone. Gaslighting is a real and specific thing but I think the majority of people who claim to have experienced it haven't, it just makes their case sound better.<EasternShade>: &gt;If it's systematic, then yes I agree with your examples but it can't be an occasional angry argument sort of thing, it has to be happening so often that you doubt yourself on the regular. Yes. Consistent messaging is part of it, at least making the distinction between an incident and a pattern. The difference between a one off heated argument with yelling and constant abusive screaming. I would say an incident is still gaslighting, but that an incident is different than a pattern. &gt;Another reason I think it has to be systematic is because people frequently remember things wrong, just because our versions of an event are different doesn't mean anyone gaslit anyone. If one person constantly overwrites the narrative to one that is favorable for them, despite disagreement or uncertainty, lack of intent may not be sufficient. It's less common, but well intentioned people can wind up abusing others. &gt;Gaslighting is a real and specific thing but I think the majority of people who claim to have experienced it haven't, it just makes their case sound better. In life, I would not take this approach to people discussing abuse. When it comes to arguing on the internet, I understand people sometimes abuse buzzwords to try to buy credibility for their argument. But, the risk of treating someone that's been abused as though their experiences are just a buzzword is real.<oversoul00>: &gt; In life, I would not take this approach to people discussing abuse. When it comes to arguing on the internet, I understand people sometimes abuse buzzwords to try to buy credibility for their argument. But, the risk of treating someone that's been abused as though their experiences are just a buzzword is real. Well it's sort of like the boy who cried wolf right? If we know there are bad actors who abuse the word and dilute the meaning of it that means they also dilute the response to it. If we want the response to be visceral (which I think we do) then we need to be a little skeptical and call out bad actors when we see them. If a real victim gets caught up in that skepticism I blame the masses who abuse the word not those who are trying to keep the word legitimate. Either way I appreciate the civil discussion.<EasternShade>: &gt;Well it's sort of like the boy who cried wolf right? The boy that cried wolf was *a* boy repeatedly lying. This would be more like ignoring fire alarms, because pulling them is a common prank. There are social problems with abusing language, but assuming that those using some particular keyword are lying seems a comparable effect to those using the language to lie. &gt;If a real victim gets caught up in that skepticism It's not skepticism, it's cynicism. Skepticism is, \"they may be misusing this language or lying.\" Cynicism is, \"don't trust people that say those words.\" &gt;I blame the masses who abuse the word not those who are trying to keep the word legitimate. I have a strong emotional response to this. I was in the military, I have seen this attitude justify murdering innocent people. So, I'm trying to temper my response. If I were to adopt this rationale, this is the assumption of guilt over innocence and using the existence of the guilty to justify how one treats the unknown and innocent. In the sense of protecting one's self, security dictates assuming bad actors. But, when it comes to acting towards/against others, assuming innocence prevents unjustified action against the innocent. Having reasons for acting unjustly does not make it just. I totally get suspicion when people abuse trust, but I can't overstate the importance of holding people accountable for their sins, rather than the sins of others. &gt;Either way I appreciate the civil discussion. It's a sorely missing experience. But, I'll also point out we wouldn't be having it if we'd assumed the other wouldn't be civil. ;)<oversoul00>: &gt; The boy that cried wolf was a boy repeatedly lying. This would be more like ignoring fire alarms, because pulling them is a common prank. The bigger picture in that parable is that people stop believing when their attention is abused. It could be about a boy repeatedly lying or it could be about a society that has little respect for language. Also the number of times I have experienced someone tripping a fire alarm as a prank is very low (maybe 3 times in my whole life) compared to the number of times I have seen people rush to the conclusion that someone has been gaslit. &gt; but assuming that those using some particular keyword are lying seems a comparable effect to those using the language to lie. I don't believe I said I assume that people who use the term are lying, I said it makes me skeptical because it's overused, but I hear people out. &gt; It's not skepticism, it's cynicism. Skepticism is, \"they may be misusing this language or lying.\" Cynicism is, \"don't trust people that say those words.\" I think you are assuming things about me that may not be true. When I hear that word I'm skeptical, I wonder if they might be misusing the word because I have seen it so often. It really depends on the context. If I hear the word very soon after I have met someone I'd be wary...it reminds me of those kinds of people who introduce themselves with a tragedy. &gt; I have a strong emotional response to this. I was in the military, I have seen this attitude justify murdering innocent people. So, I'm trying to temper my response.

Having reasons for acting unjustly does not make it just. I'm not totally sure where you were going with this to be honest, are you saying the methods we use matter even if our goal is good? I agree if that's the case. &gt; I totally get suspicion when people abuse trust, but I can't overstate the importance of holding people accountable for their sins, rather than the sins of others. Again I don't automatically assume people are lying, I hear what they have to say, but I am suspicious. I recognize it's a real thing that happens. Some people must be using the word correctly to talk about their experiences, I just don't think it's the majority.<EasternShade>: &gt;The bigger picture in that parable is that people stop believing when their attention is abused. The people also suffered for ignoring the boy as the flock was killed. So, it's a caution against lying, but also not trusting people. &gt;the number of times I have experienced someone tripping a fire alarm as a prank is very low Compared to how many times in earnest? Yet, if it's tripped prudence dictates checking. &gt;people rush to the conclusion that someone has been gaslit. I would be wary of anyone rushing to assert something about someone else's experience. I'm speaking about people stating their experience. &gt;I don't believe I said I assume that people who use the term are lying I may have read into your skepticism. In any case, your clarifications along this vein seem in line with what I'm promoting. &gt;I think you are assuming things about me that may not be true. This is possible and not my intention. I apologise. &gt;are you saying the methods we use matter even if our goal is good? I agree if that's the case.

Maybe that's my baggage I shouldn't bring into my views or maybe there are a ton more people out there like them, I'm honestly not sure.<EasternShade>: Yeah, bad actors fuck it up for everyone. And bad actors that absolutely insist above all else that they're doing it for the good of others really fuck it up. It's extra fucked up when abusive and manipulative people will claim to be the victims of abuse, often claiming to be the victims of the ones they are themselves abusing. And that's the logical portion. Get into the projection and hasty generalizations and other shit brains naturally do and bad actors can make the world seem filled with cartoon villains. Relating to the military experience, I'm remembering more of the people around military installations and that, \"Never trust no one,\" was pretty solid advice. Especially when it came to personal relationships. Fuckers were crazy in Killeen. &gt;Maybe that's my baggage I shouldn't bring into my views or maybe there are a ton more people out there like them, I'm honestly not sure. This is how people learn. We experience things and make guesses about the future based on those experiences. There's no easy way to tell when experience and prediction is correct or when it's lying its ass off. For me, when it comes to people that I don't know, I'm pretty trusting so long as it's not risking myself, but if people want something from me or if I'm going to trust someone with something important to me, then I'll do more verifications and keep an active eye on things. But, it's still all a crap shoot.<oversoul00>: I thought more about your point about justifying not trusting victims. My point is this. We can believe everyone who makes the claim no matter how trivial and work it that way, but it dilutes the meaning of the word and subsequently the response. This, to me, is a bigger injustice to victims. Or we can be a little more vigilant about the use of the word and call out bad actors, this will unfortunately carry some casualties, people who were really abused but aren't expressing themselves clearly. However this will also keep the word more powerful than if we took everyone at their word. We KNOW that people will be abusing the system/ the word so in my mind...its better to defend the word and call out bad actors even if some real victims get caught up in that mix...because the alternative is to dilute the word and dilute the reaction to real cases of gaslighting for everyone. So I don't want you to think I'm trying to justify shitting all over victims experiences because that isn't the goal, I just believe it's the lesser of 2 evils.<EasternShade>: In the balance between protecting the abstract and the specific, I err on benefiting the specific over the abstract. &gt;So I don't want you to think I'm trying to justify shitting all over victims experiences because that isn't the goal, I just believe it's the lesser of 2 evils. I don't think that's your goal. I think it's a potential side effect of an extreme version of your view. Similarly, the extreme version of my views has a bunch of people's lives ruined, because some said, \"witch,\" or the modern equivalent. It seems a judgement call and we have different priorities for it.", "num_messages": 16, "avg_score": 310.625}

Give me a tl;dr. <Blahblkusoi>: TL;DR version - Hawking and his bro James Hartle proposed 40 years ago the idea that the universe pretty much made itself via quantum mechanics in a very non TL;DR friendly paper. Since then, other physicists have used that paper to make the case for an infinite, fractal multiverse that our universe is a part of. Whether or not this is true is the mystery. Hawking and his other bro Thomas Hertog then put out this paper making the case that the last paper may or may not actually mean there's a multiverse and, if it does, that multiverse may not be the all-encompassing kind of infinite, but instead the some-encompassing kind of infinite since every law of every universe within the multiverse may have to be formed in the same process that ours were. They implied that, in some cases, it could be possible to detect another universe because of this.<MoreGull>: Thanks friend. I would love to hear how it would even be theoretically possible to detect another Universe. <Blahblkusoi>: This all depends on if I'm interpreting this stuff correctly, which is entirely up in the air, but I'll give it a shot. The idea assumes quantum field theory is correct, which is basically the idea that particles and the fundamental forces are concentrated points on a tensor field: a thing like a conceptual grid, line, or ray that can represent quantum data in spacetime. The fields themselves can be thought of as a function, spacetime as the graph the function writes to, and the particles and forces as points along the graph where the field is more concentrated. Our best guess of why the cosmic background radiation looks the way it does is that these quantum fields settled into their current states in the first picosecond, or 1 trillionth of a second, after the big bang. That means that before that occurred, our universe had different, \"simpler\" laws that at least included spacetime. If those simpler laws are shared between universes within the multiverse, it could be possible that our spacetime has a kind of distortion in it like a fingerprint from other universes' quantum fields settling into different states than ours did. If spacetime has this distortion, we might be able to see it in the cosmic background radiation.<GeneraalSorryPardon>: Thanks! I'm too dumb to understand Hawking but your comment made it somewhat more understandable for me. <Blahblkusoi>: If you want in on a real ballbuster of physics related to this, read on. The higgs field is one of these quantum fields and is responsible for the higgs effect, a process where particles from other fields, including those responsible for the existence of quarks and thus atoms, are given mass and energy by moving through the higgs field. The weird thing is that the higgs boson itself isn't responsible for this effect, its the vacuum state of the higgs field that does it. What that means is that while other quantum fields states in the vacuum are at rest with a value of 0, the higgs field's state is not, its positive. This leaves open the possibility that the field responsible for matter as we know it will decay into a lower energy state through an effect called quantum tunneling and literally delete us from existence. Since this effect would propagate through the universe at the speed of light from the point in space of the tunneling, it may have already happened. Maybe more than once.<supersplendid>: Loving your writeups. Please feel free to post more!<Blahblkusoi>: Sure. You don't have to tell me twice to keep on rambling. Something pretty important I've left out so far is the concept of virtual particles; tiny perturbations in quantum fields that are kind of like your typical particles but aren't quite the same for a pretty weird reason. You've probably seen a [Feynman diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Feynmandiagram.svg/1280px-Feynmandiagram.svg.png) before, which is a visual description of an interaction between two particles, and has some extremely interesting properties of its own that I won't get into right now. In the case of the image I linked, the interaction being described is a simple collision between two electrons in a process called scattering. That squiggly line in the middle represents a virtual photon being \"exchanged\" between them. Basically, the electrons, which are just concentrations in the electron field, got close enough together that they caused an excitation between them in the electromagnetic field: they interacted by way of electromagnetic force. This means they transferred their momentum as energy between each other across this excitation in an equal and opposite reaction. This is a fancy way of saying they bounced off each other, but didn't actually touch in the way we're used to seeing objects do in the normal world. Here's where it gets super weird. Even though a photon is mass-less, a virtual photon might not be. The virtual particle exchanged can be of any energy, any mass, can travel in either direction in time, can travel faster than light, and can take any route between the two electrons (including creating and annihilating other particles spontaneously) and even produce any result. In fact, in order to most accurately predict the result of the interaction between the two electrons or any other interaction between two quantum states, you must account for all of those infinite possibilities simultaneously in some pretty funky math. It is through this weird way of thinking about virtual particles that scientists were able to suss out how to purposefully manage quantum entanglement, as well as experimentally verify that quantum states can actually evolve backward in time in a process called retrocausality. What this boils down to is that those two electrons colliding is only most likely going to interact in the way you think it is, and that's good enough almost all of the time. However, there does exist infinite possibility of it doing something completely off the wall and wholly unexpected, it just has a very very low chance of working out in any of those ways. This is what the process of quantum tunneling that I mentioned earlier really is, its just a normal interaction behaving in a really abnormal way. <Vampyricon>: Virtual particles don't exist. They're only a mathematical tool used to approximate the interaction of two particles through a field.<pm_me_deepthoughts>: At somelevel cant that be said of almost all elementary particles as well as multiverses. They are just mathmatic tools we use to explain experimental measurements and create theories to test. <Vampyricon>: Nope. You can touch real electrons. You can't touch virtual electrons.<pm_me_deepthoughts>: Then what purpose do the virtual electrons serve? <Vampyricon>: They are used to approximate how the electron field actually interacts. That's why I said they're purely mathematical.<lkraider>: Virtual particles are the mechanism how black holes \"radiate\" and evaporate. So they are real at least in that sense.<Vampyricon>: Nope. If you read his original paper you'll find no mention of virtual particles anywhere. One has to understand is that vibrations in quantum fields *are* particles, and black holes stop quantum fields vibrating in certain ways, what we call vibrational modes. Since the vacuum field is made of various vibrational modes cancelling each other out, some modes being prevented means some other modes can't be cancelled out, which means the field would be vibrating, i.e. there are real particles. Virtual particles don't come into this because, as I've said, they're an approximation scheme, not something real.", "num_messages": 16, "avg_score": 627.0625}

We can certainly use the observations that have contributed to our biases to formulate research questions that can then contribute to out understanding of the topics we care about, but we should not use these observations and biases as the actual truth. <nross368>: \" People don't have opinions on fact \" yes they do.

As for you not holding an opinion you're stupid to not see the assertion you made. &amp;#x200B; **\"Please link peer-reviewed support for a such a claim or refrain from armchair academia\"** The premise is that if you can not 100% prove your claim then it's false.

We do not have nearly enough data to consider either of those possibilities the official scientific consensus, so I will refrain from espousing my personal observations and biases as fact. I recommend that everyone else does the same, but I recognize that this is reddit and not an academic journal so the standards of objective fact-checking will likely not be met. I am well aware of the existence and the effects of antidepressants. There's a great amount of peer-reviewed research discussing the mechanisms, efficacy, and prescribed application of these drugs. I understand a reasonable amount these drugs. What I dont understand is how this class of drug is in any way related to whether or not marijuana influences depression and suicidality.

You debate skills are truly the stuff of legend<nross368>: That why i got an emotional response out of you. <funkisintheair>: Yeah I think any reasonable person would read this thread and agree that I was an emotional banshee the whole time. I suggested that we use the scientific method (the only reliable method of determining objective trith) and use peer-reviewed research to back our claims. I said that we should go by the established scientific consensus and recognize when one hasn't been established in a nascent field due to insufficient data. That clearly makes me a junky who also blindly hates weed who also \"is too stupids\" to know about common pharmaceuticals. Got me there. What was I thinking?<nross368>: First of all scientific method isn't the only reliable method for determining objective truth. It's the reliable method for determining truth based on the current system of scientific framework. E.G. Theory of relativity or whatever the current system of science is oriented towards. The scientific method is just a way to validate reality through the current framework. If your about science and accuracy you would know this. But in reality your a charlatan. At the end of the day I misinterpreted your stance but my points are just as valid.<funkisintheair>: The scientific method is the method by which scientific theories are originated and scrutinized, thus contributing to the scientific consensus. I dont know know what you're so mad about, but you may want to calm down and think for a second. The things you're saying and the way you're typing them make it seem like you're juiced up or something. It's embarrassing to see; I can only imagine what it must be like to do.<nross368>: You haven't addressed any of my points and have resorted to Ad Hominem and repeating yourself like a parrot. Reply with some actual thought and I'll treat you like a peer. Otherwise your just a fool repeating 21st century dogma. <funkisintheair>: I reiterate my point because it is self-evident, yet you clearly have difficulty understanding simple concepts so I have tried to spoonfeed you my point. Again, you should calm down and figure out why you're so mad. I've seen this behavior in juicers before, and a quick glance at your profile immediately confirmed my suspicions. You might wanna get some help<nross368>: Yet again you have not addressed any of my points and reiterated your point like a parrot... You fail to see the point of making. Your point is understood. I've just moved past it and you can't wrap your head around my point. So if it makes you feel better to justify in your head that I'm wrong because xyz without addressing my point and paint the narrative that you're the victim, then go ahead. This conversation has come to an end if all you have left is theorizing about hormone usage. Since your a man of science why don't you look at studies of endogenous testosterone usage. If you did it would invalidate your theory. But you won't take the time to do that. You're intellectually lazy and dishonest. Your points highlight that. You've said nothing of substance and brought no new value to the table. You're essentially an echo chamber of 10th grade science. There is truth outside science. <funkisintheair>: I've never claimed that there is no truth outside of science. There are personal truths and cultural truths certainly, but the only kind if truth that is true for all people regardless of who believes it is objective truth, which can only be found through rigorous application of the scientific method. What theory have I proposed that you think would be invalidated by further research of testosterone usage? My theory that you're an overly aggressive juicer who encourages others to juice while also posting on subs dedicated to misogyny? Because I think the evidence there speaks for itself. I am a bit curious about what you even think the question of this discussion is though, so feel free to include that in your next roid-rage fueled rant &lt;3<nross368>: I won't address the second part due to the obvious disingenuous nature of the question. The point I made was the your \"Objective truth\" Is based on a subjective system. All past science was objective until proven otherwise. The earth was flat until proven otherwise. All of [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics), including [Newtonian physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_physics) were refuted. That is the nature of science. Nothing is concrete. So when you say that \" I suggested that we use the scientific method (**the only reliable method of determining objective trith**)\" I was pointing out the clear fault in your logic that you just addressed yourself with the above statement \"**I've never claimed that there is no truth outside of science. There are personal truths and cultural truths certainly, but the only kind if truth that is true for all people regardless of who believes it is objective truth, which can only be found through rigorous application of the scientific method.** \" Your universal truth cant be universally true if what you said above is true. If it's universal then why can't personal truths and cultural truths be seen through a scientific lens? How can you explain religion using the scientific method? &amp;#x200B; You're intellectually retarded. Read a book.<funkisintheair>: Objective truths are truths that are known through rigorous application of the scientific method. Further analysis using the scientific method may cause our understanding of objective truth to shift, yes, but this shift is toward the newly accepted consensus. There is nothing subjective about it. There is nothing subjective about data. There is nothing subjective about statistical analysis. The *only* part of the scientific method that is arbitrary is the threshold against which we decide significance, but p&lt;0.05 has worked as an excellent threshold to create models that work time and time again. I don't know why you think that the fact that the consensus has shifted throughout the years is proof of the flaws of the scientific method; that is the explicit goal of the method. You wanted to know about the relation of personal and cultural truths to scientific objective truths. The truth is that there is very little relation between them. Personal and cultural truths may very well be true to the people and the cultures that hold them, but under scientific scrutiny they are not found to be objectively true. Whatever religion someone holds may be entirely true to them, but this truth only exists when that person holds it. Objective truth is a better metric because these truths are true regardless of who believes them or not. A cultural truth may be that the earth is 6000 years old. This may be true for the religion, and this tells you important things about the culture and the religion and the meaning behind these religious truths, but this is not an objective truth. Through application of the scientific method we find that the earth is ~4.5 billion years old. This truth is objective and accurately describes the physical world without any care about who believes it. I have read a bit more than a few books, but I'd love to know what books have contributed to the fascinating wasteland that seems to be your mind. Any good recommendations?<nross368>: See you fail to see what I'm saying and you're reacting within the very framework I'm criticizing. You're just reiterating old points. &amp;#x200B; Look outside the scientific framework... Read Julius Evola ride the tiger. The lens your viewing this question from is wrong. Not your statement of facts within that lens....<funkisintheair>: As long as I'm living in the physical world I'll view it and attempt to understand it through the lens of objective truth and scientific reality, not fascist mysticism. Evola founded this school of thought because physical investigation of reality did not yield results conducive to fascism, so he had to view the world through supernatural bullshit. I hope you can escape this toxic framework because nothing good comes from that road<nross368>: While I'll admit I haven't finished the book and thus refine my thoughts on the topic I will respect your fervor for debate. We disagree on a fundamental level so I don't see this conversation progressing any further at this time. As for you last point do you have any studies to back that up? Or is that something that lies in the subjective realm along with most things outside physics and fundamental ABC analysis. <funkisintheair>: We can quantify and analyze data of whether or not people want to live in or are happy in fascist states. We can look at the data for what happens when fascists take power and who suffers from that. This is sociological data and is subject to an incredible amount of confounding variables, personal bias, lack or precedent, and other bullshit that complicates establishment of scientific consensus, but I firmly believe that the scientific method is too important to abandon just because its application is difficult<nross368>: I'm not disregarding the usefulness of scientific method. It's success is undeniable. My main point as the discussion progressed is that when speaking of depression/anxiety and the tendency to self medicate is undeniable and needs no studies to prove its prevalence. Not to mention the personal aspect of depression/anxiety that \"is subject to an incredible amount of confounding variables, personal bias, lack or precedent, and other bullshit that complicates establishment of scientific consensus\". So the scientific method couldn't work on something so abstract. The scientific method is used to make money. That's its primary purpose. Anything outside of that is purely coincidental. Science move us away from reality and towards a system that destroys all semblance of reality to deconstruct and make use of elements for production purposes.<funkisintheair>: I never claimed that it is untrue that people with non-motor mental health conditions tend to self-medicate. This point is not only \"self-evident\" but well-documented and considered the scientific consensus. My point of asking for a source and accusation of armchair academia came from the person specifically claiming that marijuana use is not a cause of these conditions. This is the point about which there is no consensus and is the point about which I wanted us to not make bold un-supported claims. For your last paragraph, science is used in the context of capital exploitation but is not exclusive to it. We see science in a commodified, destructive light because of the society in which we live.

The font has more space between letters. <Colar>: There is also [OpenDyslexic](https://www.opendyslexic.org/) which is free.<tuctrohs>: The font in the original post refers to various research results that indicate that it is in fact helpful. I'd be curious to learn which features are actually effective, and whether either is more effective than the other.<kekabillie>: [The research says it makes no difference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5934461/)<flyawaylittlebirdie>: It does actually help reading, it just doesn't make it quicker. Just more accurately. At least from personal experience<kekabillie>: The study addresses both accuracy and rate and found no improvement across the group. They also looked at participant preference, and found that participants were not able to read typefaces that they liked more quickly or more accurately. Your experience may be true for you but it doesn't generalise to larger populations.<flyawaylittlebirdie>: That's because it was a study on children. Dyslexic children. To learn how to read when dyslexic is hard enough with accomodations I honestly am not at all surprised that it didn't change anything in that study, they definitely didn't give enough adjustment time. A better study wouldn't be broad and simple study like that but to look at progress over time. I would bet children who use a dyslexia font over long periods of time will have better reading skills than those who don't.<kekabillie>: The font is intended to make reading easier i.e. more accurate and fluent. If it needs to be explicitly taught, then it takes time away from teaching areas that we know improve reading accuracy. Given there is a critical period for teaching literacy, I don't see why we should spend time on things that might work (even though the evidence suggests it doesn't) instead of things that have a robust evidence base. Regardless of this, everyone needs to be able to read a variety of typefaces because that is how written words are presented in the wider world. Your bet has no theoretical framework or evidence base to support it. Dyslexia is not a vision issue.<flyawaylittlebirdie>: You realize you're talking to someone who is *actually* dyslexic this condescendingly? I genuinely don't think you understand what dyslexia is. No shit, it isn't directly a vision problem. It is, in part, caused by your brain mixing up visual signals so it may as well be partly considered one. It makes it extremely hard to read, but even harder to comprehend what you have read because you're concentrating on simply figuring out what word is in front of you. The issue can be more about reading comprehension than it is about sounding out words. Even more than that, I don't think you understand that illiteracy is a huge issue with dyslexic children. You cannot teach someone to read better than the fundamentals when that is all they are capable of with typical reading environments. I was illiterate until third grade. I had to teach myself my own method of comprehending words because normal learning environments did nothing. I don't even have that bad of dyslexia, and I still managed to fall through the cracks because the typical setting does not matter whatsoever when you're dyslexic.<kekabillie>: I would caution against interpreting and policing tone in online conversations. You might also consider that the experience of having a disorder is different to being able to support and treat it in another person. This is why we seek advice from doctors when we are sick and not other patients. I'm not disputing that you, individually, may have found this helpful. I work in the field of dyslexia, so yes, I understand it. Your brain isn't actually mixing up visual signals, it's having difficulty connecting the visual area to the language and auditory areas. This is an important distinction because there has been such a waste of time and research into areas that don't make a difference (e.g. coloured paper and coloured lenses). Comprehension of written text is the most complex part of reading but it is the end goal. It requires everything else to be in place first (e.g. oral language, phonological awareness, phonics, decoding, and fluency). People with dyslexia usually have a deficit in a core area that prevents them achieving mastery of the above areas (working memory, phonological memory, phonics, phonological awareness, rapid automatic naming, oral language). Of course illiteracy is a huge issue. It's addressed through intervention targeting the fundamentals, not by changing the font. It's unfortunate that your school didn't have an approach that recognised your difficulties at school entry and provided appropriate intervention. It's even more unfortunate that this experience is the common one.<jostler57>: Hi, I\u2019m a teacher and am currently wrapping my head around Dyslexia. What is your job in the field of dyslexia? I\u2019ve been reading a great deal about the effective teaching strategies that are being used, but wonder if there are any other useful resources out there. Do you have any recommendations?<kekabillie>: I'm a speech-language pathologist and I work in education. If you want to share your country and what age you teach, I can suggest some specific websites and books :)<jostler57>: We have locations in both Taiwan and China. It seems people in China are extremely under-informed on the topic of Dyslexia, so I just streamed a lecture on the topic, but I\u2019m by no means an expert. I just Googled around and spent several hours reading articles/watching videos from the /r/dyslexia subreddit.<kekabillie>: Oh, are you teaching English or Mandarin? English I can help you with but Chinese is a whole different kettle of fish. Different orthographies (writing systems) produce different reading circuits in the brain. I wouldn't know where to begin with dyslexia and Chinese characters.<jostler57>: I'm an English teacher, over here - my wife's family owns a small chain of schools, and I design English curriculum for several classes.<kekabillie>: Most of the links are pdfs, just fyi. Okay so it depends how deep into this you would like to go. If you want a lot of information on best practice teaching of reading, see the National Reading Panel report [here](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/nrp/smallbook) and [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/publications/pubs/nrp/Documents/report.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiQ9-H7xdDhAhXVfH0KHf3bCZQQFjAAegQIAxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0dX35X2ibqbW8NTdvIiind&amp;cshid=1555278198137) and the Jim Rose report [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://dera.ioe.ac.uk/5551/2/report.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi9jamLx9DhAhWh7HMBHWiuAeoQFjAAegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0aUT7Km21vF-eOejsrfRHf). These were literature reviews completed in America and Britain respectively. If you want more of an introduction to the topic of learning difficulties, the AUSPELD [parent](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://uldforparents.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ULD-AUSPELD-PARENTS-UPDATE-Sep17.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjruaPox9DhAhXFdysKHSX5CucQFjACegQIBRAI&amp;usg=AOvVaw0jT1VCGGaXFO5SsWzE9BkD) and [teacher](http://fusecontent.education.vic.gov.au/d3f1d4f9-fefe-400f-af93-97f6cf63459f/p/pdfs/DSF4449PracticalGuide-Accessible.pdf) guides are very clear and not too wordy. The accompanying fact sheets should be available [here](http://fusecontent.education.vic.gov.au/d3f1d4f9-fefe-400f-af93-97f6cf63459f/p/index.html) They've recently been updated but the old versions are still good and available freely online. For general good practice literacy resources: If you're looking for vocabulary resources, look for anything written by McKeon and Beck. For phonics and phonological awareness resources, the Letters and Sounds curriculum is available freely online [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190599/Letters_and_Sounds_-_DFES-00281-2007.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwit0eCOyNDhAhWYfCsKHX-XAscQFjAEegQIBhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2E7d3t0ZmNdSoYV-Rbkcgh). The [spelfabet](https://www.spelfabet.com.au/phonics-resources/) website also has a lot of great information and resource suggestions. If you're interested in getting your head around the neurology of dyslexia 'Proust and the Squid' by Maryanne Wolf and 'The Reading Brain' by Stanislas Dehaene are both excellent. I've heard 'Overcoming Dyslexia' by Sally Shaywitz is a helpful resource for generally understanding dyslexia but it's in my to-read pile so I can't tell you much more. I don't think I have any single resources for comprehension or oral language as they're such broad areas. <Edit>: Added links", "num_messages": 16, "avg_score": 388.125}

The short story is that Warner Brothers was able to change the laws of a sovereign nation to weaken unions and suppress wages for actors and crew.<Hambredd>: I don't get how facing up to the reality of take a pay cut or don't have a job is somehow a weakening the film industry. It's not like NZ had a film industry outside Lotr; when you've got Ireland and Eastern Europe giving way better deals why would you go to a sheep panic on the other side of the world? And I can't feel that sorry for the 'poor' unions.<JM_BP>: found the manager<Hambredd>: No, I just understand the market well enough to realise that film companies are going to go to the cheaper option, and I've been in enough unions to know they are made up of greedy self-interested people who care about themselves not a fair deal for their members. If that's the best argument anyone can come up with against mine then I must be pretty on the money. <essidus>: Hi, sorry it took so long to get back to you, I was on a trip. So here's my problem. If what we want is a free capitalism, WB directly contradicted that by using government to create a favorable deal for them, and then get a pile of money on top of that. That is directly anti-capitalist, and more plutocratic in nature than anything. Yes, the actors organized to seek higher compensation and more rights. Agree with their position or not, they control a resource and have the right to bargain for the value of that resource. WB might have capitulated or sought the resource elsewhere, sure, but that is a healthy economy in action. What ended up happening is that a company was allowed to pay rates that made it necessary for skilled workers to take on a second job, because they lost the right to bargain altogether.<Hambredd>: Unfortunately I don't believe in free capitalism, I believe in a socialised government working in tandem with a free market. One of their responsibilities should be to make sure that the economy remains competitive on an international level, that includes wage control and tax breaks. The actors do not control the resource because there are cheaper actors out there, eastern Europe and Ireland are well known for being far more friendly to cheap film companies. The only reason Lord of the rings was filmed in New Zealand was because the company valued artistic vision over profit they didn't in the case The Hobbit and chances are no other company will in the future. So if New Zealand wants to start playing with the big boys it better start acting like it. I understand the union didn't want to take a pay cut because no employee does, but then again no employee can look longer term then the next pay packet or they would see that they would be better off in an industry flush with jobs then one starved of them. Believe me understand, I belong to a union that makes the same stupid short-sighted decisions are all the time.<essidus>: In this particular case though, the action taken by the government had no real long-term benefit. Even before the issues with the union, there were already cheaper options for film. The government action was just as short-sighted and reactionary as the unions. However, if they had retained the power to bargain collectively, they could've at least protected themselves for domestic works. That's not an option any more until further government action. Frankly though, I don't think either of our positions are wrong, just different with different strengths and weaknesses that will work better in some cases than others.", "num_messages": 10, "avg_score": 100.5}

After securing the ball in a safe deposit box, he turned down some initial weak offers, including one from Topps trading cards that guaranteed him $100,000 and free tickets to baseball's All-Star Game and the Super Bowl.
