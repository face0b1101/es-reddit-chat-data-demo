Do you mind sharing more about the trip you did? How long did you hike there? Was is a multiday one? Would love to go to Nepal in the next few years as well :)<hornylittlegrandpa>: Not OP, but spent two months in Nepal a few years back, although not for hiking. Wonderful country, and can\u2019t wait to return. Some points from my experience: - Kathmandu has some amazing historical sites but overall I found it extremely dirty and crowded. There\u2019s definitely sights to see but I recommend spending a couple days there and moving on. - My personal favorite city was Pokhara, it\u2019s beautiful and much cleaner, and there\u2019s a beautiful lake that\u2019s ringed by mountains. Can\u2019t recommend it enough. - Perhaps it\u2019s a bit more stable now (I was there in 2012) but when I was there, there was a nationwide strike, and apparently that wasn\u2019t uncommon. Nepalis are very political in my experience. - For the most part, Nepal is very welcoming to foreigners, and people are very friendly. That said, as with most any foreign travel, have your wits about you and watch out for scams. No, that boy doesn\u2019t actually need baby formula for his little sister, he\u2019s just going to sell it back to the shopkeeper (a grift I experienced several times in Kathmandu). - Nepal is very affordable, and even more so outside of Kathmandu. If memory serves, I was able to haggle the cost of my hotel in Pokhara to around 4 or 5 bucks a night, and it was a pretty nice hotel. - Speaking of which, haggling is very normal in Nepal, and foreigners are usually going to be given inflated prices for things. Don\u2019t be afraid to haggle people down. - If weed is your thing, it\u2019s plentiful and common in Nepal, and there\u2019s even a holiday (shivaratri) during which it\u2019s commonly smoked. However, be wary of the people trying to sell it to you, especially in Kathmandu. It\u2019s very common for these guys on the streer to whisper in your ear things like \u201csmoke?\u201d Or \u201chashish?\u201d If you bite, they\u2019ll pull you into an alleyway and, at worst, mug you, but typically they\u2019ll just try to massively rip you off (we\u2019re talking 100 usd for an amount that actually costs around 15 dollars). Personally, I had better luck asking the shopkeepers at head shops. <EDIT>: accidentally posted before I was done typing <gpwpg>: Thanks for sharing! How about travelling around? Airlines in Nepal are notoriously dangerous I guess (which is a bit unfair considering how hard of conditions they fly in).<hornylittlegrandpa>: I flew I to Kathmandu on an Indian airline (don\u2019t remember which) and from there traveled by bus or car (I, luckily, had help from Nepalis with this aspect so unfortunately can\u2019t help you much with that info)<gpwpg>: Thank you anyway. Did some research and Im a bit scared. How was driving by bus?<hornylittlegrandpa>: Extremely cramped; most buses end up packed to the gills and then packed some more. Including people on top, which can be fun! Don\u2019t recommend that on the mountain roads, but in the terai I rode on top of the bus frequently.

Factoring in ~30 minutes to deboard and get to the train and ~1h-1h15min m of travel to and from downtown including walking and finding a coffee shop. You'll have ~2h not including any time being spent smoking a joint.<dunzeod>: Oh Tbh i don't really care too much for wandering the city. I'm going with my girlfriend this summer for pleasure anyways and I'd like to spend leisure with her. I just wanted to get high for the flight. <swollencornholio>: I meant that you'll have 2 hours before your flight leaves, not 2 hours to spend in Amsterdam. So if you usually go to the airport 2 hours before your flight you'll have no time.<dunzeod>: Oh I'm sorry. I thought that sounded a bit weird haha.

I'm from Vietnam and I'm planning to travel to Singapore for one week next January. I'm finding a place to stay with the price less than 50$/night. I searched on AirBnB, and the website suggest that I stay at the apartments **IN MALAYSIA**, near the border between Malay and Singapore - the area near the bridge connecting two countries. So my question is: should I stay at those apartments? I'm mostly worry about the **transportation** and the **Visa** thing. Is there any immigration check when I take a cab from Malay to Sing?<oscarjeff>: Try a hostel. Singapore has some hostels that are more upscale or have capsules if you want more privacy. <lovelyiris2>: We are couple, so I need a place that is big enough. We also need private bathroom, because we use it a little much in the morning. And, as you can guess, couples need to do \"couple things\", so I can't take hostel. <CheeseWheels38>: Hostels often have private rooms. If you want a private bathroom then you'll need a pay for the appropriate place. I think that staying outside of Singapore to save ten dollars per day per person for a week is insane. You're saving even less when you take into account travel costs. Out of curiosity, what are you actually doing in Singapore for a week? What's your total budget like? <lovelyiris2>: I see. Guess I'll choose a hotel or apartment in Singapore then. We don't have a budget limit, it's just \"don't spend to much just for a one week trip\". But we're trying to minimize the accommodation cost and put more money in enjoying Singapore. After all, we're gonna spend most of the day out in the city.<brp>: Recommend you get a tourist unlimited metro pass for Singapore when you land at the airport and stay at a hostel near an MRT station. It will be very cheap to get around if you can walk to the MRT and take it anywhere you need, that it will make up for the fact that you maybe are paying a bit more for the hotel.<lovelyiris2>: Thank you for your suggestion. I also have plan to travel using MRT :D<brp>: Like I said - just make sure you get unlimited tourist the pass at the airport. It's only sold at the airport and like 2 MRT stations. I didn't get one and was really annoyed that even some of the larger staffed MRT stations did not have it available for sale. <lovelyiris2>: Ah, I see, didn't know about its limited availability :D<brp>: Yup. Also, if you are looking for Budget accommodations, Little India is a decent place to check out. You can get rooms for like $50 a night or so. It's conveniently located around 2 MRT lines and easy to get around. <https>://www.agoda.com/reddoorz-near-lavender-street/hotel/singapore-sg.html?checkin=2019-01-11&amp;los=4&amp;adults=2&amp;rooms=1&amp;cid=-1&amp;searchrequestid=a2952e7a-ebf4-4f84-8c35-0e611af47881&amp;travellerType=1&amp;tspTypes=3&amp;ssri=0&amp;tabbed=true<lovelyiris2>: Thank you.

Flying in that first afternoon I might go straight down to Lugano for 3 nights. Then head back north for a night in Lucerne, before a few nights somewhere in the Lauterbrunnen valley. A full 5 nights in Bern with day trips each day around the country, before a night in Zurich on the way out. How does that sound relative to the original?

My wife and I have 2 kids (8 and 10). When I travel alone for work, I usually have a duffel bag, and my laptop bag. But, previous family trips involved SO MANY bags. Toys for the kids that they never played with, ridiculous amounts of clothing, 10 pairs of shoes, etc. The last trip, to Mexico, was a backpack and carryon for each kid and my wife, plus a HUGE 55lb suitcase that got checked. I had a duffel bag and my laptop bag (since I had some work to do). That's 9 total pieces of luggage. If steamer trunks were still a thing, we would have had like 2 of them filled. We're going on a family trip in a couple of months. Destination is warm, 500 year old historic city for the first half of the week in a 400 year old hotel, and a beach hotel for the second half of the week. I want to get myself down to one light bag (no laptop bag), and convince the wife and the kids that they don't need to bring everything they can possibly fit. This trip will have a lot more walking and exploring than previous trips. But, we'll have a hotel to stash our stuff during the day. My goal here is to get everyone prepped and have everything down for when we start traveling to Europe regularly. I'm thinking of using Rick Steve's packing list from Europe through the Back Door, and then getting one of his bags or something similar. These are the two I'm looking at: - https://store.ricksteves.com/shop/p/carry-on-backpack - https://www.ebags.com/hproduct/ebags/mother-lode-tls-weekender-convertible/143101?productid=10126285&amp;cat=travel-backpacks&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;couponid=94790994&amp;sourceid=ADWPRODUCTH&amp;adtype=pla&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9J-628ed3wIVCJ7ACh34hAhGEAYYASABEgIarPD_BwE Plus, I'd get a small crushable backpack for a day trip bag. I'd like to get my wife to get one of these bags as well and get it to be the only bag she takes. I know Rick Steves has a video with one of his female employees giving a talk on what to pack if you're a woman, and I might be able to get her to watch it. Changing 20+ years of packing habits is probably not going to be easy though. The kids are old enough now where we don't need to bring toys. A pad of paper for drawing, and a tablet for games is enough entertainment to keep them from getting antsy on the plane and give them something to do before bed. So, my questions: - Does anyone have feedback on either of these two bags above? Or, recommendations on something better? I don't want a backpack that looks like I'm a backpacker, and I don't want luggage with wheels. I don't want to look like a tourist, and when I'm alone in other countries I'm pretty good at blending in. - What tips do you have on packing a single backpack for a kid that contains everything they need, and will be able to carry? We can probably carry some stuff also, but I want to get them used to carrying their own stuff and being self-sufficient in that regard. Are there good travel backpacks for 8-10 year olds that are not touristy looking? - What tips do you have for getting my wife on board with this idea? - Any other general tips <yellowpolish>: You mentioned \"first half of the week\" and \"second half,\" so it sounds like you will be travelling for a full week? Let's just say 8 days. I would pack outfits for 4 days which means each outfit will be repeated twice. You can probably do two medium suitcases as your checked bags (mom+kid in one, dad+kid in another). For the plane, each of you can carry a small bag or pack. The kids can probably bring their school backpacks. Mom can bring a backpack or large purse, you can bring a backpack. Since you will be in a hotel for half the trip, that automatically cuts down the soap/shampoo needs from your toiletries. Since you will be in a warm place, walking shoes and sandals. It's good to have two pairs each so you can air out a sweaty pair between wears. The kids can probably get away with just sneakers and maybe some flip flops for the beach. I wouldn't buy new bags. Sounds like you all have travelled before and already have luggage. Don't add an unnecessary expense. For your day bag, use the same bag as your airplane personal item (casual backpack, book bag, tote-style purse).<signal15>: I want to avoid checked luggage, it's a PITA. I never check luggage when I travel alone. I'm not concerned about buying new luggage. I just want something well designed that suits the type of travel I'm doing. My current laptop bag is great for work, but not so much for leisure travel. My duffel bag is fine, but lacks compartments and pockets for organization, something I seem to need more of when traveling for leisure. Plus, the plan is when in Europe to switch locations several times over the course of a trip, so light packing and not having to wheel around heavy luggage is pretty important. Packing light for leisure travel should be easier than business travel though. With business travel, I typically have to bring a suit and dress shirts and dress shoes, and those take up a lot of room.<yellowpolish>: Oh, gotcha. In that case the bags you posted look fine. I personally have an Osprey pack which I tried on at REI before I purchased it. In terms of compartments, I love packing cubes. You're only going to be gone a week, though. <signal15>: True, only gone a week this time. I'm viewing this as a test run before we start booking trips to Europe that are longer and have multiple destinations. So, I am planning on doing the packing cube thing and everything that you'd do on a longer trip. One of the principles of the Rick Steves packing methodology is that you pack the same way whether you are going for a week or 6 months.", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 0.8}

Hey guys, so I\u2019m pretty terrible when it comes to planning trips. Last time I went anywhere was a few years back, spent 2 months on Kauai backpacking around with no definitive goal. Had a blast. The time has come again and I want to take another adventure similar, and I think I\u2019ve settled on Southeast Asia. Only issue is my indecisiveness makes it incredibly hard to plan anything out. I will have roughly 2 months to spend traveling, and a not very tight budget, but I do want to keep the cost low as possible. I was thinking of trying to make it to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, but I would also love to go to Bali. I just have no idea how to go about it. If I can just book the flights I\u2019m sure I can just wing the rest, as dumb as that sounds. I really hate having a day to day schedule and wouldn\u2019t mind spending one week relaxing on a beach and then the next week in a random city or village. Basically just take the adventure as it comes lol. If anyone could point me in the right direction, that would be great. I\u2019m into photography and will be taking as many photos as possible, and as far as lodging goes I was planning on finding hostess to stay in. I also am really trying to get into surfing but I live in a landlocked state and can\u2019t do that here. I\u2019ve surfed a few times in Hawaii and once in Florida and I\u2019m dying to do it again. I would not be against spending the entire trip on different areas of the coastal regions and going surfing everyday. Sorry if I\u2019m lacking details, I just really don\u2019t know where to start. Thanks in advance! <A-Ayy-Ron>: I spent 5 weeks earlier this year travelling around Thailand and Vietnam and I think you can definitely get by on a budget without planning too far in advance. I had planned out where I wanted to go but I didn't want to be locked into anything and booking accommodation and transport as I went was really easy. I think SE Asia is a really good place to visit without a set plan, but I still think it's worth figuring out a general sort of route and some key places you want to visit . What time of the year are you planning on traveling?<BoofinDaddy69>: Planning on leaving early January and coming home early March. And right on, good to hear that it\u2019s not too tricky. I was originally planning on Central America but figured Asia may be better for now! <A-Ayy-Ron>: Should be great weather that time of year. As you go it's a good idea to book any trains or buses you want to take a few days in advance if they seem to be filling up, I had a few times where I left it until the day before and had to wait an extra day or so. What's on your list of places/ideas so far?<BoofinDaddy69>: So I literallly just have a few saved locations from others mentioning them here and on other subs, some are Ho Minh/Da Nang, Phnom Penh, Krong Kampot, Sihanouk, also Pai Thailand, then I also saved Kata beach and Pansea Syrian beach.. Not sure if you know but I\u2019m wondering if I could get something like a next day flight to Bali from one of those countries, for not too much. I\u2019m also unsure where I even should book my main flight to the area plus the return home and from which city. Hopefully that made sense <A-Ayy-Ron>: That's a good list of places so far! I think you should be able to get flights to Bali from any major city, I think next day flights are likely to cost a few hundred dollars though, the further in advance you book it the cheaper it will be. It could be worth going to a Bali at the very start or very end of your trip, that way you could get some better prices without having to plan your way around it mid-trip. I've never been to Bali before, but if it ends up being too much effort to get there I think places in Phuket and Ko Samui could be quite good alternatives which might be a bit easier. Flying into the area I think the cheapest flights will either be into Bangkok or Ho Chi Minh. I flew into Bangkok, made my around Thailand then flew to Hanoi and made my way south through Vietnam and flew out of Ho Chi Mihn. That could work well for a route through Thailand -&gt;Laos-&gt;Vietnam. You could fit Cambodia in there as well pretty easily, or you could go from Vietnam to Cambodia and fly out of somewhere there.<BoofinDaddy69>: So the alternatives you mentioned in Vietnam, what\u2019s in those two cities? Or do you mean they are just worth visiting? <A-Ayy-Ron>: Sorry which alternatives do you mean? Hanoi and Ho Chi Mihn?<BoofinDaddy69>: Oh, in the part where you mentioned alternatives if I didn\u2019t make it to Bali.

But I don't know how thugs might treat you there in Libya if they find that you are foreign/ tourists.<RyanIsMegatron>: I imagine majority will treat you the same as all these other media called upon war torn countries. With nothing but compassion, consideration and friendliness. <valeyard89>: I went on a tour in Libya about a year ago.. the day before we arrived the airport had been closed due to fighting (and a plane was damaged by gunfire). Heard a scattering of gunfire one night I was there. And the locals were a bit suspicious/paranoid. Though we were sitting at a cafe and this woman and her daughter kept watching us and were curious about us, they came up to talk to our guides.<panameboss>: Who did you go with? Lupine?<MickeyFinns>: Always nice to see our name pop up :) I've tour led the Libya trip once.<panameboss>: Awesome I'm very jealous. Btw I know you guys did (or still do?) a tour to Socotra island. Have you heard of this relatively new Yemenia flight from Cairo to Socotra via Seiyun that apparently runs once or twice a week? I've seen a bunch of people talk about it running and that you have to buy the tickets in person in Cairo but then I haven't seen anything from anyone who's actually successfully taken it.<MickeyFinns>: Socotra has been delayed a couple times now, my colleague who is looking after that trip is currently waiting on some military clearance then hopefully the trip will finally happen. We've looked at the flight options which might be how it ends up happening. The issue is you don't just need Yemeni permission to go to Socotra, you need some Saudi documents too.<panameboss>: Ah very interesting. I thought you might need Emirati documents since they're super involved in South Yemen but had no idea you'd need Saudi ones for Socotra. What's the best way to keep track so that I could get on the trip to Socotra if (when inshallah) it happens? Just follow your website?<MickeyFinns>: There's a waiting list specifically for it, if you email me, James at Lupinetravel.co.uk I'll get you on it.<panameboss>: Great, just sent you an email!

I'm flying to Queenstown, New Zealand for a week to trip around the Southern Island. I'd like to rent a house with my friends in March. What place do you recommend? I was thinking Wanaka or some place like that with the views. What should we see South? I like all the bays, the coastline, mountain view (not cold). Next we'll be on North for 5 days, what place do you recommend max 5h drive from Auckland airport?<Souprx>: eh, you're going to be in nz for 2 weeks and you want to rent a house? You won't see both islands properly in 2 weeks, just sprint through them spending a lot of time driving and not a lot of time seeing much. But since you're flying into Queenstown, i'd just stay there - take a day trip to Wanaka and then go up through Mt Cook / Tekapo, id probably go out to the banks peninsular and see akaroa etc. I don't know where your flight is leaving from but i'd assume chch to auckland? If its leaving from QT then spend more time in QT/ wanaka and go down to milford sound / Te Anau From Auckland i'd probably get out, go across to the cocomandel, Whitianga is nice do cathedral cove + hot water beach hang around there and chill. On the way back out maybe go to Waiheke and or piha. I don't really know what you're looking for and I hate itinarys but theres a few things I've enjoyed since being here (8 months so far) you might be able to fit them in, you might not. Don't sweat it though, a lot of NZ is pretty samey it really is the highlights that make it. Controversial but I think the Banks Peninsular is chronically underrated.<podgoorsky>: Thanks for your comment! I just want to have a good sleep every day and a kitchen/grill to cook my own food. Could rent like a room in backpacker's motel or something with good people and nice view. What do you recommend? I'm 7 days on the south (Queenstown airport), then flying to Auckland to stay on the North for 5 days somewhere near to the Auckland airport. I want to rent a place with spectacular views. We like car trips and stops at every nice place. The coastline, maybe some swimming. I was thinking Coromandel actually when it comes to last 5 days on the North Island. I want the views, nice people and good food.<Lowlevelcomedy>: I agree with Souprx, if you can I would absolutely recommend sticking to one island. There just isn\u2019t enough time to see everything you can on either island with that little time, but if you do both islands here is my recommendation: South Island: I would spend 3 days in Queenstown eating, drinking, and full of activities. Maybe do a day trip to Milford sound on a bus. Then travel up to Wanaka for a day or so and to Mount Cook, stopping at lake Tekapo (Mount Cook was our favorite place). I wouldn\u2019t go much more north than here, maybe explore what Souprx suggested. North Island: wiaheke island for the first day for wine and good food. Then go to coromandel for a relaxing time. You could spend the entire time here if you want beaches and relaxing. If you want to see other things go down to Rotorua and see geothermic area, redwood forest, Maori culture, hobbiton (awesome even if you don\u2019t enjoy the films), glow worms cave (a bit of a drive but we regret skipping), and maybe go do the tongariro crossing if you are into amazing hikes but you would have to stay closer to it. Best of luck and have fun!<Souprx>: I mistakenly assumed they were flying from chch though, I wouldn't recommend the trek to akaroa from Qt just to see it esp if you can make it to Milford sound ha there's loads of cool, cheap things to do near QT if you look for them. We were just there and arrow town is a cute little town right next door and Glenorchy is absolutely stunning. Both drives north out of Queenstown are breathtaking (to haast and my cook), you literally cannot lose. Don't regret not going to waitomo! We went and weren't blown away, given how far away it is from.. anything, I could easily pass on it<podgoorsky>: We ended up renting a house in Wanaka for 7 days in March. We will see QT, Milford, all the lakes and bays within 2-3h driving. What about the North? Is Coromandel okay to stay for 5 days?<Souprx>: Wanaka is tiny, there's really not much to do there. I would think about what you're actually planning on doing. Queenstown is a good hour and a half away with better views and a lot more to do both in QT and the surrounding area. You're going to see so little of new Zealand from Wanaka. Unless your plan is to come to NZ just to chill out, in which case crack on. I'd be be pretty sad if I came all the way to NZ and spent a week in a tiny town. After you've done Roy's peak and seen the tree what else are you going to do? And sure you could spend another week in the coromandel but you'll run out of things to do pretty quickly. Witianga is where hot water beach and cathedral cove are but witianga itself it a bit dull, average beach and a couple of takeaways. If you're looking for nice beaches you need to be in the Northland, piahia for example. I don't understand your way of holidaying so I can't really offer any advice. Milford sound is going to be a good 5 hours driving one way. You seriously think you're going to spend 9-10 hours on the road and enjoy Milford sound?<podgoorsky>: &gt; Unless your plan is to come to NZ just to chill out, in which case crack on. I'd be be pretty sad if I came all the way to NZ and spent a week in a tiny town. We rented a house in Wanaka for 7 days. I loved the scenery of these lakes around. We will spend few hours every day there to sleep, eat and grill. It's a good start point for 2-3h daily trips. When we do that kind of ride we always make short stops so we should see at least the area. Won't be able to see that much in 7 days but that's just a reason to come back. It's more of chilling than climbing the mountains. Wanaka scenery looks awesome to just do that.", "num_messages": 8, "avg_score": 2.875}

I understand the purpose of travel insurance from a sort of dictionary definition stand point, but I'd like to understand it from a practical point from other travelers. I'm from the US and the only time I've been international was when I traveled in Europe while studying abroad in college. So obviously I'm super naive about all things travel. I'm looking at taking my family to the UK for a week next fall, so I'm trying to be more prepared and less of the typical erratic college kid abroad I was last time. What are the benefits of having travel insurance? How do you figure out what will best suit your travel plans? What have been your experiences with utilizing it when needed?<super_salamander>: The only part of travel insurance I care about is the part where they fly me out of Bumfuck, Democratic Republic of Shitholistan to a Western hospital after my lungs mysteriously fill up with water or an alien starts growing in my chest or something. The bit where they pay you to buy a new hair curling iron when the airline loses your luggage can go fuck itself, but it\u2019s included. <Edward_the_Penitent>: \"Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment\" and \"Body Repatriation\" are two of my favorite travel-related terms.<super_salamander>: I don't care as much if I get killed. I'm far more concerned about getting half-killed and relying on the hospital preventing me from completely dying having been cleaned this year.<Edward_the_Penitent>: &gt; I don't care as much if I get killed. Your family may when they're billed for your body's repatriation. It is not cheap. I don't mean *you*, I mean anyone.<elijha>: Most people who are regularly traveling internationally likely have a fair amount of savings and no beneficiaries, so repatriation could be covered by their own estate.<Edward_the_Penitent>: Data source required.<elijha>: Well, I guess I'm thinking about the situation where someone is traveling alone and dies. Not a family vacation where daddy kicks the bucket. But still, it's basic deduction. Traveling frequently is not something that people without resources can do. Traveling frequently, especially in riskier ways, is also more common among people who aren't tied down with commitments at home. Sure, there are tons of exceptions to those, but in general, penniless families of eight don't tend to spend a lot of time gallivanting.<Edward_the_Penitent>: &gt; But still, it's basic deduction. According to a quick search, it costs $5,000 to $8,000 USD to repatriate a dead body to the US from as nearby as Mexico. With that amount of money, a traveling person can buy insurance that covers this expense many, many many times over. If we are talking in terms of \"basic deduction\", it is clear what the wiser option is here. I also disagree with your presumption that you must be \"penniless\" in order to not have thousands of dollars on hand, and which your family can immediately utilize to bring back your body. I don't think I need to go into why the legality of this situation is also troublesome.<elijha>: Surely I don't need to explain that the insurance being much cheaper than what it insures against (as insurance always is) doesn't automatically make it a wise option. I wasn't even saying insurance is or isn't wise though. I'm just saying that the people who are most at risk of dying abroad are probably also best prepared to cover their own repatriation. Now, if that describes you, I do think it's silly to buy travel insurance just for repatriation protection (alive-me doesn't want to pay anything to save dead-me a few thousand dollars). If it doesn't, make your own judgement call.<Edward_the_Penitent>: &gt; I'm just saying that the people who are most at risk of dying abroad are probably also best prepared to cover their own repatriation And I'm just saying you and I are traveling to different places if you think the average traveler has 8 grand to blow on repatriation. &gt;I do think it's silly to buy travel insurance just for repatriation protection No one said this. &gt;alive-me doesn't want to pay anything to save dead-me a few thousand dollars This entire conversation was started when I mentioned that the family of \"dead you\" may care, so it doesn't matter what \"dead you\" thinks.<elijha>: &gt; if you think the average traveler has 8 grand to blow on repatriation. The average millennial has something like $4k in savings, and I don't think it's crazy to assume that those who travel internationally a lot (or at all, even) probably have a fair bit more. If no one is counting on an inheritance from you, you can \"blow\" every dollar you had on getting your body in the ground in your home country and it doesn't matter. &gt; No one said this. You said \"\"Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment\" and \"Body Repatriation\" are two of my favorite travel-related terms.\" which is pretty close, no? &gt; This entire conversation was started when I mentioned that the family of \"dead you\" may care, so it doesn't matter what \"dead you\" thinks. My entire point is that, for the people I'm talking about, they don't need to care about the money part since the estate could pay for it all. The normal thinking on insurance is that it's better to pay a little than to *maybe* have to pay a lot, but that goes out the window if you won't be around to care that the \"lot\" went to pay for repatriation instead of to your parents or something.<Edward_the_Penitent>: &gt;My entire point is that, for the people I'm talking about, they don't need to care about the money part since the estate could pay for it all. And my entire point is you're basing this on absolutely nothing concrete and in fact I doubt you are correct. I am still waiting on the source I asked for in my first reply to you. &gt;The average millennial has something like $4k in savings 1.) This is far less than $8,000. 2.) That's great for Millenials. What about Gen Z? Because they're the ones I'm picturing here. 3.) [The GOBankingRates survey, which identified millennials as ages 18-34, found that 67% had less than $1,000 in savings.](http://fortune.com/2018/01/24/millennials-saving-money/) 4.)

Typically, they arrive just after noon, spend about 2-3 hours on the site and then leave. Even worse, they rush to the Treasury (at peak time) take their picture and then leave again. For the love of God, do not visit Petra like this. The site is magical and it's huge, it takes you at least a full day to explore. &amp;#x200B; I entered the site as soon as it opens (6AM), which meant that I basically had the Treasury to myself. Vendors and locals weren't even set up yet. After a coffee and enjoying the view I started the hike to the Monastry. Since it was still quite early there was barely anyone on the trek to and at the Monastry. By the time I returned from the Monastry the major tour companies started arriving so the site started filling up.

We then decided to beat the crowds to the Monastery. When we arrived there were less than 15 people--absolutely lovely.

Booked it online through Kayak, car company was EuropeCar (I think). Just a basic 4 door automatic, so a little more expensive than a manual, but still only $125 or so for those 4 days. Gas, however, is much more expensive than the US. It was about $50 to fill up the tank. But it was worth it--I liked the freedom.<Zoetekauw>: Being Dutch I'm used to those gas prices. Think I'll opt for something similar. Thank you for the info!<bluebuddha11>: Glad I could help! As you drive through town toward the main entrance/tickets to Petra you have to curve to your right &amp; go slightly uphill. This is where the parking is--buses to the left, car parking on the right. It is free, which is nice. We got there around 6.30 am both days &amp; had no problems with finding a spot.<Zoetekauw>: Sweet. I'm looking to reserve one day for Petra and spend the remainder hiking Wadi Rum.

Lhasa is located in the highest region on earth, the city itself is at a safe altitude, but the surrounding Himalayas get to dangerously high altitudes. The Train that connects China to Tibet has a sealed cabin with oxygen pumped in. If it didn't, the passengers could die from the lack of oxygen. The only way to go to Tibet is through a government sponsored tour, it is illegal and impossible to go on your own. If you start in China, a tour company can organize a train or plane to Lhasa. If you start in Nepal, it is possible to go safely by car, but it has to be on a government sponsored tour, with a tour guide driving the car. <DannyMalino>: I know all of that and that's not what I asked and the reason I created this post lol<UncleSpoons>: What are you talking about? You asked why google won't let you drive to Lhasa, I explained why, because there isn't any roads, and if there were, you'd die from altitude sickness.<DannyMalino>: No, I asked why Google maps doesn't let us have directions from outside side China to inside<OstentatiousDude>: Google doesn't work in China.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 1.1666666667}

I\u2019m fairly well traveled through the cities, and I know you can risk some redundancy of seeing the same thing over and over again. We\u2019re trying to figure a route that includes variety, but ties in beaches. I\u2019d prefer it was a logical route (at least as far as budget goes). Paris will be the starting spot, as fianc\u00e9\u2019s must is Euro Disney. I\u2019d like my must to be Croatia. Most likely Dubrovnik, but open to suggestions. We\u2019re looking at coming home through Athens. I\u2019ve looked at the South of France and a few islands of Greece, but became a tad overwhelmed. This is me taking a break for the night and looking for some inspiration. Dates mid to late August 2019, approximately 10 to 14 days. 2-3 Paris, 3-4 Dubrovnik. Thoughts? Suggestions? Thanks! <swollencornholio>: If 10 days Paris-Dubrovnik-Athens would be your trip. If 14 you could add one more place. No beach destination would really make sense by train unless it was close to Paris, Athens or Dubrovnik soo...you would want an aiport nearby too so you can go to your next destination. St Tropez Saronic Islands Islands near Split (Hvar)<zwandz>: Do you recommend Dubrovnik or more time in the Greek islands? <swollencornholio>: Depends what you're trying to do. For site seeing Dubrovnik, for chilling at the beach Greek islands. You could add a Croatian beach to Dubrovnik and get both. I'd actually recommend not flying out of Athens and leaving Greece for another trip. Instead see more of Croatia: Split, istrian peninsula (Rovinj), or Plitvice are some ideas...maybe even Ljubljana and Bled. Another idea is Kotor, Mostar, Split and the isles for beaches and plitvice to the trip. Looping from Dubrovnik to Venice with Split + Bled could be a good idea too though it may be a tad packed schedule wise with Paris in there. <zwandz>: The flights from Croatia to Toronto are insane, so that\u2019s where Athens came into play. I could also add a major European hub for 1 day just to get the flight reasonable if I cut out Athens. The more read around about Croatia the more nervous I am it\u2019s going to be stupid touristy. Which I know sounds strange, but what\u2019s your take on that? Especially in comparison to Greece <Edit>: and once Athens came into play, I became interested in the islands and that\u2019s right around when I got overwhelmed <swollencornholio>: &gt; The flights from Croatia to Toronto are insane, so that\u2019s where Athens came into play. I could also add a major European hub for 1 day just to get the flight reasonable if I cut out Athens. That's why I mentioned Venice. Venice is generally cheaper to fly out of internationally and you can get cheap flights from Split-Venice. Could actually do something like Paris-Dubrovnik-Split for beach - fly into Venice then bus to Dolomites for some Alps then back to. Split is actually has cheap flights to Paris too so you could do a roundtrip then add Kotor and Mostar to the Dubrovnik + Split portion to round out the trip. There's also cheap flights from Split to Florence, Milan, Amstrdam Salzburg, Dublin Dubrovnik is well connected to Bari, Milan, Naples, Rome, Venice, Vienna, Athens, Paris, Berlin and Dublin. I think I would pick a beach that's in Croatia, maybe stay on Hvar. Then from there it's up to you. I personally would avoid flying the entire trip...so if I was going to Paris I would add St Tropez, Nice, Chamonix, Colmar or maybe Switzerland and Benelux but you seem pretty set on plane hopping. &gt; The more read around about Croatia the more nervous I am it\u2019s going to be stupid touristy. Which I know sounds strange, but what\u2019s your take on that? Especially in comparison to Greece Dubrovnik will be crazy touristy, like Prague levels. Other than that it's pretty standard. It's why people don't recommend too much time in Dubrovnik can see most of it in a full day. If you were travelling in one day I would stay 2 nights and leave the 3rd day unless you want to daytrip to mostar and kotor. Santorini and Mykonos is a similar level of touristy. Both locations have tons of less touristy options.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 1.3333333333}

Unfortunately, since it's winter, I'm struggling a bit on where to travel to, so I'm hoping you guys can help me out! Just a note, I prefer weather anywhere from 50s-70s (F). &amp;#x200B; I'm a 27M living in NYC. However, I don't want to go to big, touristy places like NYC because it'll be overcrowded with people. I tend to enjoy smaller cities. &amp;#x200B; As for international places I've been to: Taiwan (Kaohsiung; Taipei), Thailand (Chiang Mai), the Philippines (Manila; Leyte; Palawan), South Korea (Gangnam), China (Beijing; Hong Kong), Indonesia (Bali; Lombok; Jakarta), Poland (Poznan), Canada (Toronto, but I was a kid and don't really remember much). &amp;#x200B; Within the USA, I've mostly been along the East Coast. Off of the East Coast, I've been to Hawaii, but that was on a cruise, so I didn't spend much time on the islands. This isn't exactly the USA, but I've also been to the Bahamas and Bermuda while on cruises. &amp;#x200B; I'm looking for a place where I can enjoy the outdoors and enjoy smaller towns/cities. Ideally, my next trip was to hike the Dolomites in Italy, but I fear it'll be way too cold to go there in January. I enjoy hiking for fun, but usually limit myself to day trips like those found in the Catskill Mountains. I would say my camping experience is extremely low. Also, I wanted to see the Cinque Terre in Italy, but I hear that it is now crowded with tourists. I assume visiting the Cinque Terre is also not so enjoyable during the winter months, but hiking through the five towns and experiencing the cultures sounds like my type of trip. &amp;#x200B; Other than hiking, I do enjoy trying new kinds of foods. I'm not so much into nightlife. I would not go in to a club or a place with loud music, but I would go to a quieter bar to wind down after a long day. I enjoy seeing historic sites, like Peru's Machu Picchu, and learning about its history. I am not so much into art. As for beaches, I don't mind them, but would not spend more than two nights along a beach. Of course, if a beach is recommended or along a route, I will most likely check it out. Otherwise, I want to do more exploring! &amp;#x200B; I only speak English. There's Google translate, but sometimes that isn't enough help, or reception is bad. Just a thought to keep in mind. &amp;#x200B; Some places that I've wanted to travel to are: Mexico, Peru, UK, Japan. I'm just sure if any of these places are good to see during January. I'm also intimidated by foreign languages since I will be traveling alone. The UK will be English-friendly based on my above list, but I do not want to be limited to there if other countries are more English-friendly than most people think. &amp;#x200B; I would love all and any recommendations! I don't expect itineraries (not stopping you if you write one though!), but if you have suggestions on how to fill my time, I welcome it!<peIVasse>: I would suggest Oberstdorf, Germany. It's very quiet and peaceful and you're surrounded by mountains. You can either ski Nebelhorn mountain or hike all you want during the winter months. It's also a tourist resort but it's not extremely populated like most resorts can be. Not to mention that you won't get lost because it's a small village and the train station is connected to it. Many restaurants with excellent food as well. I highly recommend this place. I also wanted to mention a few things during my experience there. My Airbnb host was very nice and the place I stayed in was very nice with a balcony facing Nebelhorn mountain. I was lucky enough to have sun the entire week but keep in mind they do have their fair share of rain so plan accordingly. I didn't ski because I was there for a competition for a different sport and didn't want to get injured but I still went up the mountain on the ski lifts. You have to take 2-3 different lifts to get to the top but the views are more breathtaking each lift that you take. Once you get to the top they have a restaurant of some sort with windows to spend your time eating/drinking while enjoying the view. There is also a small tunnel above the restaurant that leads to a sky walk that you can walk on to experience what it's like to be at the top of a mountain and look straight down. Very cool! I didn't do any hiking but I do know they have it. If you end up going I hope you have a good time. Good luck!<soQuestionable>: This sounds beautiful!

I flew out to a Costa Rica trip in essentially shorts. But...when I got back...completely forgot about it, and it was a blizzard.

Hi everyone! My friends and I are planning a Jan/Feb trip to Norway, mainly to see the northern lights &amp; landscapes.

What is the best way to get around it? Is renting a car necessary?** If so, what are the driving conditions like in Feb? My friends are experienced drivers but they have no real winter driving experience. Of course, tips/comments about all aspects of this itinerary would also be very much appreciated! We are still in the early stages of planning and this is my first serious-winter trip. Usually I just can't take the cold, but hey northern lights\u2026(I know there is no guarantee but I'm hopeful. :)). Thanks for reading!<aknomnom>: This sounds like so much fun, please post any awesome photos you take! I've only been to Oslo and Bergen, but in case you're interested---there's a great food hall in Oslo off Youngstorget. It's fun to walk around and offers really tasty food. I ate lunch at the seafood place---delicious---and picked up some charcuterie to snack on during my train ride to Bergen. There's also a lot of cool street graffiti/art in that neighborhood as well, if that's your thing. Bergen was a little more touristy, but I enjoyed taking the funicular up to the park and walking back down. There's a good bakery near the base of the funicular, so I'd suggest taking a pastry along for sustenance on the way down (lots of switchbacks). Best of luck and safe travels!<snow-light>: &gt; There's also a lot of cool street graffiti/art in that neighborhood as well, if that's your thing. Thanks! That totally is my thing! ;) Do you think 2 days in Bergen sound about right? I would love to try some Norwegian food. Do you remember the price range for food (restaurant dishes and snacks)? Thanks again!<aknomnom>: No prob! I think Oslo has more to offer (attractions, food options, neighborhoods, etc). Bergen felt like a cutesy tourist town down near the wharf mixed together with a sleepy college town further away. I was there over an Easter weekend though, so the holiday might've skewed my experience. But based upon it, 2 days would be plenty for Bergen. Everything in Norway was very expensive compared to what I was used to paying in the US (and even pricey compared to Denmark and Sweden!) but it was also usually better quality. $20-30 USD (160-240 Kr) for a non-fancy dinner (as in a bowl of soup with bread) and $10 USD (80 Kr) for a pastry and tea at a neighborhood bakery. Beer/wine or a 3-course meal would likely more than double and triple, respectively, that budget. <snow-light>: Thanks for the quote! I hear the seafood is very good. Would like to try it a couple of times at least.<aknomnom>: It is, and you should! Have a great trip!", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 1.6666666667}

Ryanair gets a lot of hate, but to be honest they are cheap and get you to your destination in the same way as other airlines, and they fly to almost any city I've wanted to go to in Europe (often the only airline that did). But they've recently changed their cabin bag policy. You used to be able to take a small suitcase / backpack, plus a smaller bag (under front seat ). Now you have to pay 8 GBP for that (plus priority). On some recent flights that just means that the priority queue is about 4 or 5 times larger than normal queue, everyone has small suitcases or backpacks, and it is the same problem as before where it is a struggle for space. On a recent flight they actually stopped selling the priority + 2 cabin bags (I guess they have a limit), then you are limited to 10kg checked (for 10 GBP), or just the one single small carry on. When they first changed their rules (I think at the start of the year - I remember it was definitely in place in Feb 2018) the priority queue was smaller, everyone checked in bags for free so there was lots of overhead cabin space and was a much nicer system. Now that you basically have to pay for any bag other than a small one that goes under the seat in front of you it hasn't fixed anything...<lost_traveler_nick>: The current rules where changed officially in November. I think they were supposed to start in September. The rule change earlier was to gate check non priority. That was awhile ago. It's not \u20ac8/\u00a38 plus priority. To bring a larger bag onto the plane you have to buy priority. That's it. IIRC the \u20ac8 is to have a small checked bag. There is a limit of I think 90 priority passengers. It's linked to the number of overhead bins. If everybody follows the size rules there should be enough over head space for everybody. If somebody brings a larger case it messes up everything for everybody. Personally I've always bought priority. That means no change in price for me. BUT the new SMALL bag is bigger and for me that matters. I can put almost all my heavy stuff into that small bag. Camera,lenses and batteries. If I had a 15 inch laptop that would also fit. A 10KG carry on with just clothes would last me for quite a while.<web_dev_etc>: Oh yeah, i meant it is 8 GBP for 2 bags, but you get that plus priority.", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 1.0}

We've bought Milanocard for 72 hours - free public train in Milan. **Room** - So far, we have booked a room for the first 3 nights in Milan ($230) including breakfast buffet. A lot of food options! **Climate** Well, we're traveling in December. We already know that it will be cold and we're used to this weather. **Interests** - <Food>: This is extremely important! We're HUGE foodies! As long as the food is good, it doesn't matter if it's 4 star or came from a street cart. We would probably want a few nice meals at good restaurants, though. <Outdoors>: We like sightseeing. We don't mind hiking. We don't want to hike for more than an hour because of the weather. <Culture>: The whole point of traveling is to see music, museums, historic places and cultures different than your own. Any suggestions for days 4-7? <swollencornholio>: I'm not sure how you'll spend $500 when you already spent $230 on 3 nights. If you're booking things for $80/night and are staying 8 nights you blew your budget by $160 on only accomodation. That doesn't include eating, site seeing, transportation within the city, etc. Regardless I would bump your budget up and add at least one (maybe two) more destinations other than Milan. Milan gets boring after 2 days and is pricey. I would stay in Como 3 nights after Milan (guessing 12/5-12/7?) and see Varenna and Belagio. Here's a couple spots on Airbnb around $60/night t with all fees: [$50 - Real bed](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/29091847?location=Como%2C%20Italy&amp;check_in=2018-12-05&amp;check_out=2018-12-07&amp;s=dzcI7p3c) [$63 -Pullout couch](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15940168?location=Como%2C%20Italy&amp;check_in=2018-12-05&amp;check_out=2018-12-07&amp;s=tdjhbK-U) [$60 - Real bed](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/29210150?location=Como%2C%20Italy&amp;check_in=2018-12-05&amp;check_out=2018-12-07&amp;s=dzcI7p3c) I'd probably add one more city but you've allocated quite a bit to Milan already. You would basically spend a night in the other city...Verona or Bologna would be good choices. <pradain>: Yeah, I had a feeling that we may spend more than $500 and that's fine! As long as it's not over 1K. We need to save some money for Christmas haha. How about this.. Milan - 3 nights Como - 2 nights Bologna - 1 night Milan - 2 nights. We're leaving in the morning on Dec 8 so I think it'd be better if we stayed near the airport one day before we fly? <swollencornholio>: ehhh I would do Milan 3 (if you have to - if it's still refundable I would do Milan 2, Como 3, Bologna 2, Milan 1) Como 3 Bologna 1 Milan 1 - You don't need the whole day there to prep for your flight (or two for that matter). Milan's an hour away from Bologna - probably less than you travel to get to your home airport.<pradain>: Wow, Milan must be that boring! I will speak with the hotel and see if we can do Dec 1-2. Any good food places you know in Milan/Como/Bologna? :)<swollencornholio>: Read through this guide on Bologna: https://www.2foodtrippers.com/bologna-food-guide/ Prosciutto and Parmesan are heavily sourced out of Parma so you'll have loads of that.

Your Bhutanese guides knew exactly where they were going. They've done it hundreds of times before.<lastditchattempts>: I was with my dad whose mobility is limited. The guide went ahead with the rest of the group and came back later to check on us. <4_seasons_in_one_day>: So, you knew where you were going. That trail is very clearly marked. Nothing unsure about. Except to add drama to your title ;-)<lastditchattempts>: It definitely wasn\u2019t inherently dangerous like a hardcore Himalayan route requiring Sherpas and supplies but the drama in the title was actually understated. The actual hike was stressful, and the possibility of trouble real. Have you hiked the trail? The flags fall off for long distances. There are forks and pathless stretches. With my septuagenarian dad being unable to see roots and rocks due to macular degeneration and reporting an occasionally racing heart, I was genuinely concerned I would lead us the wrong way, he would run out of gas, and we would run out of daylight. We were so far behind the rest of our group the guide asked the monk at the monastery for light refreshment in place of lunch as they waited for us. We were never going to make lunch at the scheduled place, given our pace. On the way down, the guide stayed with the two of us the whole way. The descent was harder on my dad because he was fatigued from the ascent and it required muscle stability he doesn\u2019t have. He does zero strength and cardio training. The climb itself was voted toughest of our trip - more so than Tiger\u2019s Nest - by the group. The group leader printed a special certificate of recognition as a token for my dad for that very hike. I\u2019m proud of my dad for finishing! <4_seasons_in_one_day>: Ok, so the main issue here is that your dad shouldn't have been on the hike. That's all. And at the start of the hike they even ask you if you want to use a pony part of the way. It was your choice to decline. And yes, I've done it. It's actually pretty easy for an average person. Which explains why the rest of your group was so far ahead of you. The guides do this hike all the time, they know the route, they know the difficulty level and they know that the risks are minimal. Otherwise they would not have let your dad do it. If something had happened to him, the guide would have been in a lot of trouble. Unless of course, your dad misrepresented his health issues and fitness level at the start of the hike.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 3.3333333333}

Fri 4 - Train to Agues Caliente** -Look like the only trains are in the morning so may have to spend the day which I'd prefer not since it's a very touristy town. Beggars can't be choosers I guess! **8. Sat 5 - Machu Pichu** -Leave before crack of dawn. Spend half day hiking. Head back to Cusco late afternoon and crash. **9. Sun 6 - Cusco to LIMA am flight.

Traveling is a beautiful experience. Traveling is also an extremely exhausting experience: physically and emotionally draining, so please read carefully. You are going to hate yourself by the time you reach Amsterdam and here is why. You are spending too much time traveling and not enough time enjoying and cultivating the places you are going to. I have been to more than half these places, some more than once, and even then I always longing to be there and have had the opportunity to spend more time there. You cannot possibly enjoy a city in two days. I, like you, when I begin to plan my trips I look at the dates I have available and the list of places I want to go. I always find myself trying to pack tons of cool new cities into my trips because I know I have a limited time to experience these places and I don't know if I will have the opportunity again. You need to move away from this mindset. You're only going to do a disservice to yourself. In these 45 days I would narrow it down to 6 to 8 or 9 places you really want to see and go enjoy those as best as you can. I cannot tell you how much time you're going to spend transporting yourself from point A to point B, standing in line at customs (especially as an American), checking in and out of your housing, riding the public transportation, walking to and from the places you want to go, eating food, etc. It's exhausting. You should at least be somewhat in shape for this many days beforehand. At the end of the day it is your trip and you can do what you want, but please try to cut down on your destinations and enjoy the ones you do get to see. Otherwise, frankly, you're wasting your time and you'll end up only being able to say you went to X destination you didn't really do anything. Anyway, **to answer your questions, 1.** yes, you will be able to access all these countries with your American passport. Some of these countries you will be able to travel to freely between them, others you will be stopped at customs depending on your method of transportation. **2.** There are some cities here that you can connect via train easily (London to Paris) (some are more complicated than others trying to access with various connects and companies you have to go through). There isn't one universal train that you can take. You will more than likely have to get off an on and bus to certain places if you only want to do trains. Otherwise, for example, Paris to Amsterdam and Rome to Nice, I would consider flying rather than train. That train ride alone will be long and take some time. **3.** I loved Copenhagen, but it's all preference. If I were planning your trip, I would do these cities (London, Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin, Austria, Rome, Barcelona). They all are unique enough and offer a little bit of everything. If you have anymore questions or need help planning your itinerary, I would love to help. Once you decide on which places you want to go to, I can assist you better. p.s. Once you get a taste for the travel, you will want to go back. Make the cities you missed this time around something to look forward to in the future. Safe travels! *Edit: This is a piece of travel advice someone once gave me that pertains to what I have said here.* *\"You may only live once, but you still need to live it.\" Meaning, don't get too hung up on trying to do everything, and truly enjoy the things you get to do.*<trashwizardnyc>: Thoughts?

Right now there are some great deals from major metro cities to London about March 1. Use Google Flights. Chicago to London, Heathrow (roundtrip $500). Normally $800+. <Edit>: I see you are out of NYC. Nevermind. You always get great deals on flights overseas.<trashwizardnyc>: I\u2019ve done some tweaking START * March 1-7 LONDON+surrounding areas Train * March 8-10 PARIS Train * March 11-15 AMSTERDAM Train * March 16- 25 BERLIN+surrounding areas Fly * March 26- April 4 ROME+train to Florence/surrounding areas Fly * April 4-15 BARCELONA + surrounding areas END <MightyMiami>: I have read some other comments and agree in the vain that adding spontaneity to your journey might make it more enjoying. It really is all personal preference. I like to plan, so I don't find myself wasting time \u2013 knowing I could have hit X spot and X spot and X spot in a certain manner instead of having to back track is not fun, but to each their own. I have not been to Rome, so I cannot speak to that, but I like your trip. Barcelona is a fun city, but it really is more nightlife and architecture (fun in the sun so to speak city) than any of the others. So maybe spend less time here and go someplace else or another place for longer. I lived in London for 6 months in college and I personally still didn't even feel like that was enough time. Some high points in the city for the musically inclined is the world famous **Camden Town**. Very rich history. Of course you'll want to see **Abbey Road**. **SoHo** and surrounding areas are great. Lots of gentrification and a rich LGBQT scene, but there are also some classic places in the area to visit or nearby like **Carnaby Street** or **Phonica**. There are so many great places to visit. It would be tough to list them all. BUT, I would highly recommend taking a day trip to **Bath** and do a half day trip down to **Brighton** \\- very famous for the Rockers vs. Mods era and The Who. For the majority of English people, football it next to breathing, so catching a match would be a great cultural experience. You'll see a lot of New York City in London. Some say London is the cultural capital of the world. You can literally visit some quaint areas in the city and get a taste of a culture you wouldn't otherwise visit. &amp;#x200B;<trashwizardnyc>: Thanks a ton! Yeh, in my mind. I\u2019m not stuck to this plan, and if i feel like changing or altering i am more than happy to do so in the moment. Do you recommend buying airfare between European countries whilst I\u2019m there? Incase i do want to stay somewhere longer. I\u2019m also totally okay with buying my return flight later too. <MightyMiami>: You will save money buying them ahead of time, but if you're not on a very strict budget then sure. I don't know about some of the countries, but I know England has some tough customs. You never know what questions they'll ask and they may drill you on your travel plans, especially as a solo traveller. Some may want proof that you will leave the country before you allowing you to enter. Before people tell me this is not true, it has happened to me a few times where I was asked. In the instances I didn't know, I made something up. They tend to only ask how many days you plan to stay, but I did have an agent ask me how I planned to leave. I fumbled and said plane and the slight fumble gave him suspicion and he asked for proof. Luckily I had some. They will likely only push if you plan to do an extended stay, so I probably wouldn't worry about it. <trashwizardnyc>: Good point. I\u2019m thinking, i get a round trip and i fly into London and out of London at the end, would they need to know that I\u2019m planning on traveling inside Europe or do i tell them I\u2019m planning to stay in London the whole time ? Or do they care , as long i can prove my return flight ?<MightyMiami>: You won't even really need to tell them you are traveling throughout Europe. Provide enough information without blatant lying. Before you land you will fill out a landing card, basically states your business in the country and a way to contact you on your stay. You will need to have an address to give them during your stay. The conversation will likely go: What is your purpose in England? *Holiday travel, exploring the city.* How long will you be staying? *I have a return flight booked for April 15.* Where are you flying from? *New York City* What do you plan on doing while you are here? *Sight-see, experience the culture.* Where will you be staying? *At XXX address, it's an AirBnB.* Enjoy your stay. They may ask how you plan on paying for the trip because you are staying for an extended amount of time. They may also ask you what you do for a living that allows you to take this much time off for work. There is no limit to what they may ask. They tend to be harsh and short with you. But just answer honestly. If you want to go into detail you can, but I tend to try and get through as fast as possible. <trashwizardnyc>: Brining bank statements a good Idea ?<MightyMiami>: No, no. You can simply say I saved up for it.<trashwizardnyc>: I\u2019d love your opinion how to cut to this down to 30 days instead of what i have.

I am seeking that Small Town American experience, with the motel and the diner with milkshakes and waffles. Where there\u2019s a small hardware store and grocer.

I'm wondering if other people wouldn't recommend their small towns either.<SkitSkatSkot>: Very valid point. I guess that small town, relaxed vibe just attracts me.

Buy a metro card, 31$ for a week, and you get unlimited rides for the duration. I thought 20$ would be enough for my trip and it definitely wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve refilled twice now. 2) back on the topic of subways, take a bit of time to learn which rail goes where. The one line for example runs up and down manhattan while others would go to a specific destination. Ask a New Yorker for help, they\u2019ll gladly do it. It\u2019s also a very walkable city so you don\u2019t need to rely on the subways, 3) the closer it is to Times Square the more expensive. Eat at the local stores and trust me, disregard how the store looks. Some of the best food comes from the small and danky spots vs the nice sit down restaurants. 4) people will get up on you to make a buck. For example when I went to see the Statue of Liberty the moment I stepped out to go towards the Staten Island ferry I had people stopping me and trying to get me to bite on a 31$ tour. Take the ferry. There will also be people trying to drop their product on you and ask for some \u201ctip\u201d I.e putting their mixtape in your hand and asking for 2$ 5) some must sees are the museum of natural history, the met, Central Park, visit the World Trade Center ground zero area but don\u2019t pay to go up, same with the Empire State Building. Go to Top of the Rock instead for a view of the Empire State Building in the skyline. You can also ask for Bar Sixty Five for a free view of the skyline but you wont be outside. 6) the rails may have two entrances into the subway, like one going downtown and an entrance across the street for uptown. Don\u2019t accidentally go into one and read the giant signs. 7) nyc is really cold during this time, dress very warmly. That\u2019s my experience so far. I\u2019m not a New Yorker so I can\u2019t really give you the specific must see and must do spots. I\u2019ve made those errors above earlier this week and I think it\u2019ll server someone better to learn from my mistakes haha. <pumpkinthot666>: you know what\u2019s funny, i hadn\u2019t even put the statue of liberty on my to do list for when i\u2019m there \ud83d\ude02 same with ground zero. i had places like \u201cthe museum of sex\u201d and the bryant park christmas village or whatever it\u2019s called (my friend wanted to take me to that) definitely adding top of the rock to my list tho!! i love skyline shots of NYC so i def wanna experience that in person thank you for all these tips!! i hope you\u2019re having a successful trip!<Aberama_Gold>: new yorker here. Museum of sex was a fun-ish date night activity but there's not much there. It has like 2 exhibits and some activities and a bar. Wouldn't recommend it for your trip, especially given all the great museums in the city. <pumpkinthot666>: the reason i chose those two museums out of the other was cause i\u2019m not big on museums (although that could be because i don\u2019t have any nice ones where i\u2019m from) and those two fit my interests lol", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 4.0}

After you\u2019ve enrolled, you\u2019ll still have to purchase and complete 4 qualifying oneway segments (no basic economy, bulk tickets, etc) to qualify for Silver and 8 segments for Gold. So anything you\u2019ve already purchased prior to enrollment won\u2019t count. Good luck, see you on the upgrade list!", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 1.3333333333}

My family planned to go to Europe (maybe London or Paris) in December next year. This is also be my first time go to Europe. I know it's winter, but I have allergic Rhinitis (especially with cold air cold e.g after rain, in the morning) and I live in tropic country. My question is: 1. What countries/cities is the best to visit during winter? (I really want to go to London but it rains a lot and no snow?) 2. If any of you have the same allergies as me, can you tell me your experience in winter conditions? 3. What preparations must be made before travelling to Europe? Thanks in advance!<porcupixl>: I'm from Kent, pretty close to London. It rarely snows in London and is just cold and rainy most of the time. Italy is pretty good year round, I can't comment on snowfall likelihood but its beautiful all the time. Spain is also a strong contender. Germany may give you a better Christmas feel, i believe there's snow fairly often in winter, and the Christmas markets are brilliant. I can't comment on the allergies you have I'm afraid, and just check the travel information for the countries you visit to see if there's a heightened risk of terrorism etc <that-there>: &gt; Italy is pretty good year round This is not particularly true, especially for the northern parts, where it *will* be much colder in winter. <porcupixl>: As I said, I can't comment on the allergies, in terms of beauty Italy is pretty good year round as I've visited in each season and found it really nice", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 2.0}
