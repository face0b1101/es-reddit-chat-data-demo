I work as a police officer, and I was working security at a large multi school function today. Approximately 3000 people from surrounding schools were in attendance for multiple activities. ate lunch, needless to say epic dump proceeded to commence after. As a uniformed officer, shitting is complicated, involving removing all gear and duty belt. in the public bathroom I'm removing my gear and sat my firearm on the shit tickets dispenser, do my business and proceed to reassemble my outfit when my supervisor called me to the far back parking lot, so I hastily gear up and head that way. Halfway across the large parking lot I felt my stomach clench as I reached to adjust my holster...AND THERE WAS NO FUCKING GUN IN IT! I had left my loaded weapon in a public bathroom surrounded by thousands of students. Long story short I sprinted back to the bathroom and by the grace of some deity I dont believe In my gun was still there. That could have been the most monumental fuck up in the history of the department, the end of my career, and personally I am completely ashamed at my lack of focus and firearm safety....but all I can say is today I fucked up.<Talista>: A large school function, 3000 kids. Can I ask why you need to wear a gun in the first place? Is there actually danger of someone doing something that needs them to be put down hard? [although I am thankful for police there to keep order] <Note>: I'm from a country where policemen don't wear guns in public at all<Neebat>: School shootings tend to get wildly out of hand when there is no armed official presence. If you're in a country where firearms are highly restricted, it might work out ok. In the US, crazy people will have guns, so police have to.<Talista>: Ah, thanks for the comments people. The idea of a kid having a gun is just so foreign to me. Or crazy people having guns. Now that I think about it, it terrifies me and I never want to visit there. Except that the candy is so damn addictive...<Osiris32>: Figure it this way. 100,000,000 people in the US own a firearm of some type. 99.99% of them act sane with their firearms. You are just as safe here as you are in any other first wold country.<Insighted_Cuttlefish>: You might want to re-think that 99.99%. It's probably more like, 93%.<Osiris32>: Really? 7 million people use their firearms in an unsafe manner? Hardly. According to recent stats, there were about 55,000 non-fatal, intentional shootings, and 22,000 non-fatal, non-intentional shootings. There were around 33,000 fatal shootings, of which half were suicides. So about 100,000 incidents of firearms being used in a manner which caused some form of injury. So yes, I should refine my number. 99.9% of people use their firearms in a sane manner, not 99.99%. My apologies for being slightly off.<Insighted_Cuttlefish>: Wait a minute. Are you saying they DON'T use their firearms in an unsafe manner? You don't even have to fire your firearm to use it in an unsafe manner. Just the other day I had to call the cops on neighbor for pointing a gun at his daughter and telling her to give him a hug. The daughter was flipping out. He had no intention of shooting her, and didn't, but it's still unsafe firearm behavior. Those kinds of things don't get reported into the kind of data you're claiming. Which also means you can throw in all of those unintentional shootings, because obviously they weren't using them in a safe manner if someone accidentally got shot. It's also possibly to reason that using non-hollow point rounds would be considered unsafe. Using normal rounds have a tendency to go strait through things, and damage the things behind them, while hollow points don't. So exactly how are you going to find, and backup data of all of these different factors? Let's be honest, you can't. There's probably an extremely low percentage of people who are completely 100% safe with their firearms at all times. I don't think many people would argue with that. <Edit>: Haha, man I get stupid when I'm tired. Let me re-work the last bit of this post and get back to you.<Edit>: Fixed?<EatATaco>: He gave you facts and evidence supporting his position. . .you gave a anecdote and a claim that simply owning a certain type of bullet is \"unsafe gun usage.\" Not to mention you threw out a completely unsupported percentage. WTF is wrong with reddit? Why are you getting more upvotes than him?<Insighted_Cuttlefish>: It's probably the thing about me calling the cops on the guy pointing a gun at his daughter. The thing is though, you can't really put things like 'unsafe gun behavior' into data. Or rather, you could, but we don't have data like that. (or at least not where we're looking) So the argument was kind of useless anyways, even with his illusion of 'evidence'.<Fat_Muslim_Kid>: Nobody is 100 percent unsafe with anything. Everyone who drives a car speeds at some point. Every person who has a gun may point it in the wrong direction or accidentally discharge it. At the end of the day a gun is a tool. Don't be afraid of it, respect it. Sure people might handle it outside the boundaries of safety. The fact remains that 99.9 percent of the owners don't have an accident. If drivers of cars could get to that number, we wouldn't even worry about airbags and seat belts. <Aegi>: I agree with you 99.9%, I just wish you would not be hypocritical and not use all encompassing words like 'everyone'.<Fat_Muslim_Kid>: My apologies. I do think that the use of such words shows a weak argument. If I could rephrase it, I would say the overwhelming majority and not \"everyone\". Thanks for pointing my mistake out!<Aegi>: Hey, no problem. Thanks for being awesome about it!", "num_messages": 14, "avg_score": 41.2142857143}

I would love your feedback in the comments. Here are the rules: 1. Every post must begin with \"TIFU\" (similar to TIL) 2. Only self-posts. Any more suggestions for rules are greatly appreciated. Also, we might get an FAQ going soon.<jimaug87>: I suggest a new rule! There should be some shock criteria to the posts. I.e. i put my shoes on before my socks That's lame, and just something I pulled out of my ass. You get the idea. The cop that left his gun in the bathroom was great. There's shock factor, and he *actually* fucked up. It was related because we've all had to hustle somewhere and forgotten something. I have a good example from a few years back: We're moving shit out of a house and into a truck. The truck is partially blocking the stairs so i hopped in to back it up 5 feet. Just nudge it out of the way. I didn't see the $10,000 glass, triangularly thing behind the truck. I lucked out and went on \"probation.\" Which just means if you fuck up again you're fired. <Edit>: There should be a moment of realization where your only thought is, \"fuck. .\", and the terror that subsequently runs through you. The cop reaching at is holster, or me hearing that glass shatter and fall to the ground. <kinda_alone>: If enough people want this we can add it, but just remember good sir, that you do have the magical down vote to do your own moderating.<jimaug87>: I just found this sub tonight, and that's what I was doing as I went through the pages.

And as this gets going, I have a feeling that posts will gradually shift in in a more interesting direction. If not, we can always add the rule.

At home cleaning the the pistol I noticed a build up of guncoat (bake on paint used to protect metal) on the barrel. I sanded the build up down and reassembled the pistol. I loaded up 2 clips and started cycling them through. Worked like a charm... But being a stiff spring new pistol and my hands unfamiliar with the double safety as I was cycling the second clip (to be sure it worked... science) the webbing of my thumb slid off the grip safety, the action caught and instead of the smooth sliding back I jerked the whole pistol up and onto my finger (which HAD been OUT of the trigger guard) as well as depressing the handle safety. Pistol does what it was designed to do and fires... Right through my pillow and mattress. I live 2 houses 1 road and a small grassy knoll from the federal building. Ears still ringing I break down the gun stash the pieces separately and wash my hands in the vein attempt of removing powder residue. 10 minutes pass.

He tells me that he waited because he didn't want to be involved if there was an intruder, but wanted to know that I was ok.

Windows XP was shittier than windows 2000 (YAY BLOAT), then came the ABSOLUTE HORSESHIT that was Windows Vista user interface designs (Hyperlinks?! What?!). Bloat. Bloat bloat bloat bloat bloat. Windows 7 \"streamlined\" Windows Vista, yet cut all backward compatibility that Vista had and FORCED you to stick with the Aero interface (or get a broken remix of the old one). Windows 7 is the worst OS I have ever used, and I have experimentally attempted to use most of them. Fuck, I'd prefer BeOS remixes to Windows 7. I am simply going to make a statement of qualification and assume the intelligent people will get it, while the morons will disagree because I am right: Anyone that thinks windows 7 is a good operating system knows jack shit about human interface design and has never read anything substantive about them. This INCLUDES the developers.(AGAIN: HYPERLINKS? AS BUTTONS?!)<chazysciota>: I did love win2k, to be sure. But the win7 start menu is the best iteration of the start menu yet. Once I got used to it, the search-focused functionality really won me over. [deleted]: The funny thing is you haven't realized that its \"search focused\" nature was *giving up*. The \"start menu\" was always a failure of design, and in windows 7 they just made it even more of a failure. The only way to NAVIGATE the damn thing is through the \"search\" function - or by replacing it altogether as I have done on numerous occasions. Hotkeys are my friend.<chazysciota>: If faster and easier is the pinnacle of failure, then I guess I'll take it. Also, it is not the \"only way to NAVIGATE\", just usually the easiest. [deleted]: You seem to misunderstand me. If *searching* your start menu is easier than *browsing* it, then you shouldn't even have a start menu at all. Navigating it is even more difficult than the previous version due to visual clutter, which ultimately contributes to it being easier to use the \"search\" feature. If you want to make an argument to \"faster and easier\", then hotkey all of the things. It may be the \"QED\" to \"faster and easier\" if you have a good memory, but hotkeys are not the point of visual user interfaces. As a user interface, the start menu *is* a failure.<chazysciota>: Frequently used items are anchored to the main menu. That's generally pretty useful, although the automation of it can be a bit frustrating on occasion. I don't have the greatest memory, but I don't have much trouble remembering the name of the program I want to run. WindowsKey -&gt; \"device man\" is easier for me than hunting and pecking three clicks and a r-click, and certainly easier than hotkeying every damned thing I may use. Maybe it's just because I'm accustomed to a CLI. You may assert that it is \"failure,\" but compared to what? How has it failed? Failed to what? You can just say that you hate it. Opinions are fun. [deleted]: You have reduced the value of this discussion to semantics that will lead to me defining stupid things like what a \"program\" is, what \"failure\" is, and why it applies to this context.

Around 8 miles from my home, I approached a house with a notorious Rottweiler that likes to chase (and hurt) people. Well, the fucking thing takes off after me. I thought I could just burn it out of sheer speed, but he's on me like stink on shit. I figure I'm doing around 40 at this point, and the dog is matching my speed. I'm scared for my life, so I was going batshit crazy and pedaling like I never have. I see a car up ahead. I don't give it a second thought, but as it passes me I hear a *screech* and then **thump**. The dog was apparently running after me and when the car came, it switched over to the other side of the road, right in front of the car. It died. I feel awful...even though it was a horrible, vicious dog that has mauled people before (don't ask me how it wasn't taken) , I feel responsible for his death. tl;dr-Dog chased me, car passed me, car hit dog. I feel bad. <Constant_Reader>: Dog chased you, car hit dog, dog's owner's fault.<fiveifrenzy6>: It's the dogs fault too. It was the one that chased him in the first place. Animals will be animals. Nothing he could've done would have changed what happened. Either he stops and get attacked by a dog or it gets hit. He was only protecting himself. He shouldn't feel bad at all. It's more like TIDF (today i didn't fuck up) He got away from a vicious dog and now it won't be hurting anyone else anymore. <Constant_Reader>: The dog can't REALLY be at fault because, as you said, \"Animals will be animals.\" The dog should have been inside/on a leash/behind an adequate fence. It was the dog owner's fault for allowing the dog to chase anyone. Not only that, but the dog should have been trained better to begin with. But I agree with your point that OP didn't fuck up.<fiveifrenzy6>: so it's another animals fault that an animal acted as its self? but not the actual animal who did the attackings' fault? If we are responsible for our actions how are animals not responsible for their actions? They act on their own just as we do.

Why do we think that we are the only animals at fault for our actions? We are just as much influence by other people as that dog was influence by it's owner. If you're going to blame the owner for the dogs situation you might as well blame the owners parents for the dogs situation. <wheresmyhouse>: Like kids?

I don't agree with it, but it's relevant.<wheresmyhouse>: I remember that case. It was fucked up. What should have happened was Mathis' caretaker, (I believe that's his parents) should have been indicted and convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Regardless, last year the supreme court has ruled that executions for the mentally handicapped are unconstitutional. As such, Texas can no longer execute the mentally handicapped without violating U.S. law.", "num_messages": 10, "avg_score": 30.8}
