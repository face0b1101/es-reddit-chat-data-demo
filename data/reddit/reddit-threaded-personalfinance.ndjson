I would just worry about 150$ for car insurance (also, might be able to pay months in advance).<Question>: Should I voluntary repo my car (to reduce my debt), buying a used car with the money i was going to use to pay it year in advance? My pros: Reduced debt. Much lower insurance cost.<Cons>: Lower credit score significantly Might have issues with the car I buy, since its not new and need to buy it cheap. What do you all think? Is Vol. repoing the care worth deleting over 13k of debt, I owe 6 k over the value (that fd me on the deal, first purchase). Also, most my schools will be funded by loans so I will be getting more in debt. Any advice will help, thank you in advance<jeepbraah>: Having he car repossessed does not delete the debt. They will sell the car and any difference between that number and your loan they will come after your for it. This will hurt your ability to buy the second car. <arod2008>: yes, right. I owe about 20k on the car, they will sell it for the lowest i think 10k, having a rollover of 10k to my debt, instead of the 30 that I owe now. So im asking, if you were in my position, would reduce you overall debt of 30k to 20k once the car sells<jeepbraah>: It Is only worthwhile if you can find an equally reliable car for less than $10,000. With anything less than that being the amount you will save. If you can't find anything less then you are only switching around the debts. <arod2008>: I am looking to getting a car around 3k around there, not sure how reliable it will be but im hoping it will last me a couple of years, as I fix my debt. And thanks for replying, I appreciate it very much. Im just really troubled by it all. <jeepbraah>: I would take the car to a mechanic to get them to check it out.

I'm a full-time college student who commutes about 45 minutes to school every day during the school year. I want to get an apartment closer to my college (I'm living at home with parents right now), but everything just seems so expensive. Plenty of other people I know are getting apartments, but I don't understand how they have money for it when they work less than I do! Currently I'm working 30-40 hours a week at $10.12 hourly wage and get bi-weekly paychecks (This is a summer job only, however. I don't work during the school year since I take 5-6 classes a semester). The only thing I spend my money on right now is gas, maybe $30-$40 a month but I still feel like I'll never have enough money to afford rent. What can I do to find an affordable apartment??? I live in Maine, if that matters at all.<lockd0wn>: Most college students that are in apartments have a roommate. You're also spending a lot of money on gas + car insurance each month that they dont have to pay.<financee>: Good point about the car insurance. Most college students dont have cars or car insurance. They just bike, walk, and bus everywhere during the year and have a parent or friend give them a ride home for the summer. The OP could leave their car at home and only pay for insurance in the summers. (now they should keep fire/theft insurance when the car is left at home not being used, but that is like $5 a month). <firefox15>: &gt; Most college students dont have cars or car insurance. They just bike, walk, and bus everywhere during the year and have a parent or friend give them a ride home for the summer. Honestly, this may be the case in large cities with a good public transport system and everything of value within a few square miles, but for everywhere else, I really question how accurate this is. Maybe things are different where you live, but I couldn't even tell you a single person I went to college with that didn't have a car. Heck, most had cars long before college, and they just took them with them to college. This included every on-campus person I knew. They just parked their car in the on-campus parking and used it when they need it.<financee>: No, this is the case in college towns surrounded by corn fields. Most people dont have cars in college. If you ever went to a large 30K+ person state school you will understand that most college students dont have cars. Most colleges dont have enough parking to even use a car. They give out spaces in lotteries and give priority to those that live miles away from campus. <firefox15>: I'm not trying to be confrontational, but you keep saying things like \"most people don't have cars in college\" and \"most colleges don't have enough parking to even use a car,\" and that simply isn't true. [*Most* college students have cars](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2011/07/19/top-10-new-cars-for-college-kids/) (also [here](http://www.collegeparents.org/members/resources/articles/should-my-college-student-have-car-campus)), and *most* colleges that aren't in urban centers will have enough space for cars. I didn't go to a 30k+ school--so I can't speak to that--but I did go to a 20k+ school \"in a college town surrounded by corn fields,\" and I can assure you that on-campus students had plenty of places to park. Yes, it may have been a 10-15 minutes walk from the dorms, but they had enough parking, and like I said, every person I knew owned one. I'm in complete agreement that if you go to Ohio University or OSU or UM something, you will want to make sure that there is enough parking for you. However, *most* universities will not have this problem.<financee>: It is true. Most college students dont have cars. You would know this if you want to a state university. My college was a state school in a corn field. It was not in an urban center. It did not have parking for 40,000 students. Just stop now. You are being very dense. <Neosovereign>: Did you even read the link he posted? Most college students DO have cars, but some campuses don't lend themselves to cars, OR students don't use their cars to actually get to the college, opting to keep it at their house/apartment.<financee>: Most dont.

If you invest the allowed 5500 dollars in a year into a traditional ira, you have to do this with post tax dollars, right? If you do this, you then are allowed to deduct that $5500 when you file taxes for the year and you get refunded the taxes you paid on it? I just want to make sure I understand this correctly before proceeding.<aBoglehead>: If you qualify for the deduction, yes.<a4bh3>: When would you not qualify for the deduction?<TechieKid>: When your MAGI (calculated for the purposes of IRA deduction) exceeds $71000. <http>://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/2015-IRA-Deduction-Limits-Effect-of-Modified-AGI-on-Deduction-if-You-Are-Covered-by-a-Retirement-Plan-at-Work<sammo62>: Possibly stupid question: There's no point contributing to an IRA if your MAGI is over $71k then, right? Might as well max out pre-tax 401k instead?<TechieKid>: Yes and no. If you're looking for more pre-tax/tax deferred space, then yes, makes sense to max out your pre-tax 401k and/or HSA if you have one available. If you're looking for more tax-advantaged space in general, i.e. you don't have a preference as to pre-tax or Roth, then no, you can contribute to a Roth IRA if you're not over the income limit for that. If you ARE over the income limit for a Roth IRA, then you can contribute to a non-deductible traditional IRA and convert immediately to Roth (this is known as backdoor Roth).<sammo62>: And Roth vs. 401k just depends on if you think you're going to be taxed higher now or in retirement (assuming your 401k has good investment options)?<TechieKid>: Roth and traditional are just adjectives for the type of tax advantage. You can have a traditional 401k or a Roth 401k and a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, and any combination of those four.

I spend far more on groceries/eating out then I am comfortable with. I literally look at the numbers and want to kick myself in the ass, not that I am a super lavish eater, but just that my assumption of how much I spend was so out of whack with reality. 2. Every month there are ALWAYS unexpected expenses. Some surprising, others surprise me because I never accounted for them and they are so obvious. Haircuts, oil changes, dentist appts. 3. In some areas being super aware has made cutting back very easy. No stops for a tea, no random $2-$3 purchases of gum or convenience items. 4. Budgeting has also made me think ahead and spend money now to save money later. I buy a toy a month to donate at Christmas and I also give out kickass small toy/game items at Halloween. There is a chain of stores going out of business and I wiped out their toy section/party gifts that had clearance items that were further discounted. I spent just under $100 and bought just over $500 worth of items. Enough for all my donations for the year, as well as Halloween gift bags with 6 items in each, for two years! 5. Finally writing down exactly what I buy in groceries has made me super conscious of what foods I am eating and I have been cutting back significantly on anything that is not a whole, healthy food. I realize I am still new to budgeting, but in the short time I have been doing it I have made a number of changes to my lifestyle and spending. Happily, I am spending a little less each month and making a little bit more. My goal this year was to pay off $15,000 of debt and save $10,000 for any emergency fund. Currently I am down to $9077 in debt and I have $1160 in my emergency fund. I only make $45,000 plus any side work I do, so I think I am doing pretty good! <Edit>: Ok this blew up way more then I was expecting. I am trying to answer everyone, but it might take me a bit. Thanks for all the input and conversation, this has been very educational for me! Edit 2: My inbox has gone crazy. To clarify a couple of points I have been asked a few times. - 45K is certainly more than enough for one person. - I have been supporting myself fully since I was 17. - Paid for university and college on my own (student loans were paid in under 10 years) - I own my own house (put 30% down payment at purchase) bought for a lot less than I was approved for - own my car, it's a 2002, needs to be replaced and I will be buying a modest used car for cash - The $15,0000 I did owe was due to being sick for going on 2 years now. I had to miss quite a bit of work. - I'm sorry if any of this comes off as bragging, that was not my intention I was trying to be completely open and forthright about my situation in the hopes of getting good advice (which i did) and maybe helping someone else out. - the gum thing was just an example of mindless spending (why is everyone stuck on the gum thing) - I did do a month of budgeting in December 2014 as well, so technically three and a half months. <hashtagfrugal>: I agree, you're doing great. Money just starts appearing - or rather, stops disappearing- when you're more cognizant of where it's going. Low balances in my checking account used to give me all kinds of anxiety. But if you're on a plan it's usually no big deal. <Lindsey-905>: I agree it does seem to just appear! I have a pretty solid monthly plan so although my chequing account balance is low at times, it is always above where I need it to be for all bills.<dicey>: If you're following the [four rules](http://www.youneedabudget.com/method/rule-one) then you'll get to the point where you're paying this month's bills with last month's income. I use this combined with some of my emergency fund to make sure I start off each month with around 2x my normal monthly spend in my checking account. This means I basically never have to worry about the balance since I have more than enough for the whole month's expenses. The only time I think about my balance is on the first of the month when I transfer the excess to savings.<Lindsey-905>: I will have to read the four rules, I'm not familiar. At this stage I sorta balance out my budget every two weeks on pay day. I automatically transfer all my money to where it needs to go, CC payment, savings, TFSA, bills etc.. I am keeping my chequing account amount low on purpose until I have debts paid and my emergency fund established, after that I will need to reevaluate my system. I will read the link though, thanks for the info!<Derpatologist_7>: I'm on the same path as you and a lot of it is thanks to this sub. I now get paid fortnightly so the moment I get paid I dump a large chunk into my new emergency fund which is now around 6k. For me that is huge. I'm in my 40s and have been habitually terrible with money my whole life. I've always lived pay check to pay check, hand to mouth kind of stuff. After I pay my emergency fund, I'll also \"payback\" any money I may have borrowed from my savings account over the previous fortnight. Thankfully the only bills I have are rent/utilities, private health insurance and petrol plus groceries. Which brings me to my actual savings account, so far I only have about 1k in there so far. I'd ideally like to drop a minimum of $150 per fortnightly pay, preferably $200. I also set up a sub account for my car so when things like insurance, rego, maintenance roll around I don't have to dip into my savings account proper. So far I only have around $600 in there and ideally I'd like I deposit $100 per fortnightly pay. I pay rent weekly but it's automatically drawn from my account each week from it's own sub account, so again, when I get paid I move a fortnights worth of rent into that account. So after I've taken care of all of that (god I love internet banking, takes me less than 5 minutes) I have my much lower remaining balance to cover stuff like petrol, food and entertainment, somewhere around $200-220. This has to last me two weeks and I need to be mindful of that since I'm used to being paid weekly, so I have yet *another* sub account called Holding so I divide my remaining balance in half and dump one half into the holding account, so in a weeks time I \"pay myself\" so that will cover me until my next pay check comes in. For me always being terrible with money I find it easier to use the multiple accounts so I always know what money is where and for what. It also helps keep erratic spending in check as well. Now like you, OP, I just need to monitor the small stuff like daily purchases of drinks and snacks for me and my work colleagues or fast food and the like. I haven't actually fully budgeted my day to day splurging habits but I think it would be minimum $10-15 per day and that needs to stop as I know I'll be quite shocked when I realise how much I'm wasting and that money could be going into my savings. FWIW I make about 40k per year + some bonuses and live in Australia. <thatbelinda>: Which bank are you with that allows you to have sub accounts? I'd love to do that. Am currently with Westpac and I don't think they do?<Derpatologist_7>: I'm with NAB. No monthly fees, either. I'm talking to mum now who uses Westpac and she says she has sub accounts linked to her main account. I had to go into the bank physically to have it done though. <thatbelinda>: Ahh!

They will try to re-rent even though you still paid. Then cancel your utilities. Also your lease may have a clause where you only have to pay 25% of the rent, so that last month you may not have to pay the full amount. Read your lease to see if you can pay less if you break the lease and move out. They cannot stop you from breaking the lease and moving out if you pay the full rent left. <JasonSumner>: He will most likely have to keep the utilities on during that last month. I lost my deposit due to \"willing abandonment\" at one apartment in college. <financee>: Not if he breaks the lease and hands back the keys. <JasonSumner>: It depends on the lease. My lease said I had to maintain power, climate, living condition, etc so when I left early, I cut my power which they used to keep my deposit. If he has paid everything and got his deposit back then sure, or he doesn't have a deposit to collect. Just sharing my experience. <financee>: All leases say you have to maintain utilities, but they usually have a clause for when you break the lease on what you have to pay for. I never seen a lease that said you had to pay utilities if you broke the lease. I have seen leases that say you pay full rent to you only have to pay 25% of the remaining rent. You wont pay utilities as the landlord will re-rent or be using very minimal power.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 4.0}

I took that and put it into how much by percentage each of our rent was increasing. Of the $1350 we settled on my 350/550 and him 700/800. My rent was increase by 67% and his by only 12.5%.

I have several ongoing health issues, that make working in general harder (but not impossible). Also my last formal job was many years ago, I had until recently a startup (that ran out of money) and was doing a low paying programming freelance job. So, most of what I can program is related to Mac or iOS, not by my choice (I got there because of \"market forces\", I personally don't like it), but my OSX machine (that is not even mine, it belongs to the startup) died in a irreparable manner some hours ago. Now I am in a situation where I have absolutely no idea what to do... I was suppose to deliver some code (for the freelance gig) tomorrow, but my machine died today.<financee>: I thought you guys in brazil were protected under a national union. <OrSpeeder>: What do you mean?<financee>: I worked with some brazilians. They said there was a national union that protected workers. They said even engineers were covered by the union. In the US, unions normally help protect workers from being fired when they cant work due to sickness.<OrSpeeder>: Ah, those... that is hairy stuff. It applies most to blue collar workers, there is some engineering-related associations and unions but they are nowhere near as powerful, and I am just a normal programmer, not an engineer, and here programmers, computer scientists and computer engineers frown on the idea of having unions (mostly because they are usually not worth it, my only friend that was member of a union regreted it because they kept charging him lots of money, and one day after he was fired because his specific line of work became obselete at that company, the union made the company re-hire him, even with him not wanting to go back, the company DID re-hired him, and it was very akward and he had to quit, and lost the money he would get for being fired...)<financee>: Why did he have to quit? That makes no sense. <OrSpeeder>: He worked in a cellphone game company. His speciality was Symbian and porting coded to dumbphones. Then iPhone, Android and Windows Phone launched, and Nokia suddenly killed Symbian (that in Brazil was still popular). This made his job useless... the company fired everyone on the dumbphone division, and the union managed to get some of them hired back (even unwilling ones), or rather, the union \"cancelled\" the firings. So the people came back, with an outdated skillset, and some of them don't even planned to stay, Brazil laws are very harsh on the employer when someone is fired, with the employer ending paying lots of money to the fired person, so to people with outdated skillset, getting fired means getting enough money to learn a new skillset before getting back on the job market. My friend in particular, quit because 1: he was useless in the company, and the company did not had then the resources to train him into iOS/Android/Windows coding. 2. The whole debacle cost the company a lot, specially in lawyer fees after the union sued them, this made all reaming sectors of the company get budgets slashed, this made all reaming employees look at the \"union supporters\" in a bad way, causing lots of awkwardness, subtle sabotage, harassment, whatnot. 3. He wanted to focus on learning new stuff But it was mostly 2, getting stared at and getting hated because your union wrecked the life of others, when you have nothing to do with it, feel really bad (according to what he told me then)<financee>: Sounds like he could use his work time to learn the new skill as that would be job related. With the union protection the company should not have been able to fire him if he was spending time going through materials to learn the language they use. I hate unions in the US because they protect lazy workers, but in your friends case it seems like he did not want to use the situation to get paid to learn a new language while at work. Every programmer I know teaches themselves a new language. Companies dont teach it. If you cant self teach then you will not be good as a programmer. Now I understand the bad reputation part, but he could have pulled an 'office space' and kept getting paid if everyone was being stupid. <buzzinowt>: If you think a company is going to keep on an obsolete division just so they can teach themselves new skills, you're delusional.<DocInternetz>: The point is, in this particular case, the company was made to.

During this spring semester, my mental issues recurred and I did pretty poorly.(Edit: Not really career-ending poorly, since my first semester was pretty stellar, but enough of a hit to my grades to make my parents act as they did.) My parents now demand that I finance the next semester(at the least) by myself. A semester's tuition + board is about $32,000. I have no idea where to start and I would really appreciate some help here. Thanks in advance, Reddit. <Edit>: Thank you everyone for the advice. I'll be going home tomorrow and there will be many discussions regarding all this between my parents and I. One thing I've always considered is contracting through ROTC to finance my education, where the only thing stopping me was my parents' wishes. I understand the importance of getting my mental health back under control again, and that is my top priority. Hopefully where (or when) ever I get back to school, I'll be fully able to utilize my education. Thank you all again so much.<loghorninja>: Another thing. If we're talking about Washington University in St. Louis then unless your parents hate you there's pretty much no way they're going to let you throw that away. That would be an incredible waste of potential. Are you sure you're not insisting on continuing despite your mental issues? Offer to take a break and find out how the school deals with a small break for medical reasons. A semester or year off to get your shit together might be what your parents are looking for. Not for you to just flush an opportunity like WU down the toilet.<financee>: &gt;Undergraduate tuition at Washington University in St. Louis will be $44,100 for the 2013-14 academic year There is no way that school is better than Mizzou which costs $10,586 a year for tuition. One would have to be crazy to spend $44K vs $10.5K. You can get an entire college education for the price of just one year at that crazy private school. <loghorninja>: It's one of the best schools not only in the USA but in the world.<financee>: Mizzou??? Right? Sorry, but I never heard of Washington University and I am from the midwest. My uncle even lives in St. Louis. It must be popular in the St. Louis area, but it is NOT known outside of it. Mizzou is well known. For 40K year it is a scam. I dont see how they magically offer any better of an education than at Mizzou when Mizzou can do it for $10K year. To me it would make you look stupid in an interview when the interviewer asks why you chose a $40K a year school vs a prestigious school that costs $10K a year. Paying $160K for school vs $40K does not make you look smart, so if you dont say you got it all paid with scholarships then you dont look good. <loghorninja>: Although I agree that it's way too expensive I did part of my education in Europe at a great school and paid nothing. So in that context $10k seems absurd. Food for thought.<financee>: Going to europe to get some kind of magical free education is not accessible for the vast majority of college students in the US. Now going to a community college for $5K a year or a prestigious state school with top programs for $10K a year is available to all americans. Bypassing a top education for $10K a year for some small private school with limited resources for $40K a year makes no sense. <-SnowMan->: I think you are severely underestimating the reach of private schools. I go to a private university as well and the opportunities the school has been able to provide me are pretty outstanding. I was able to live in Europe for a semester as was 90 percent of my graduating class. One of the main things that brought me to this school was the extent of their study abroad program, it far out performed most state schools. Furthermore, the insane amount of networking opportunities for me was amazing. I can name 3 friends of mine who's fathers and Uncles are CTO of international companies you would know by name. You can't sit there and pretend that it isn't helpful to know people like that. For 52k a year, yeah it's expensive, but to me and my parents it's been an outstanding experience that set me up with every opportunity to be successful. <financee>: Sorry, but you get no benefit going to a private school vs a public school when all the degrees have the same accreditation. All you will end up with is paying 4 times the price as the public school which will make you look stupid. You will have the same success if you want to the prestigious public school. You seem to be very, very susceptible to marketing. <-SnowMan->: Cool, think what you want. I know for a fact I wouldn't have been able to go abroad as easily, for as long as I did and had it count for my minor credits if I went to any of the state schools I applied too. I also know that my private school cost me an equal amount of money as every state school I applied to, even after you take into consideration any and all scholarships at each school. <financee>: Most people dont get scholarships. If you were lucky to get $30K in 'scholarships' per year then it would cost the same. But what is the point? If it is not harvard or yale, then no one is going to care about your private school degree. State universities are much more well known. <-SnowMan->: University of Colorado was 50k a year out of state. Colorado state was 40 something. Auburn was almost 40k but I got no scholarships. Kansas was 30 something but I decided I didn't want to live in Kansas. I had a full ride at U of Central Florida in state but wanted to go to a better school. I weighed my options and chose the best one for me. Yes it happened to be more expensive but I can tell you it was worth it. <financee>: Sorry, but the degree, books, and lessons are all the same. I dont see how you think you got a 'better' education by going out of state. <-SnowMan->: &gt; degree, books, and lessons are all the same. And the experiences, abroad programs, networking opportunities and the types of people you meet are not the same. <Edit>: A degree is just a degree. Knowing people, whether you like it or not, is what can make you successful. <financee>: Abroad programs dont matter. Your experience will basically be the same. You are locked in rooms with 18-24 year olds. As for networking, that means nothing. You get jobs by finding interviews which is mainly done through job fairs, the schools career dept, and searching websites of companies for job openings. You may think there is a difference, but there is not. <WarDamn17>: You are sorely mistaken if you think networking opportunities don't vary from school to school. Most prestigious schools have a large amount of successful alumni who give back to their alma mater. Be it through student clubs/programs where they donate their time and/or money, or simply hiring more interns/graduates from their respective schools. My sister went to a state school and did an internship where the owner recruited and hired almost strictly from her school (his alma mater). There are certainly good opportunities at any school to network, and help find a job if you choose to work and take advantage of them. I don't think -Snowman- is saying they are bad at public schools, he is just saying private/more prestigious schools have more and better opportunities. Generally more prestigious schools breed more successful people. <EDIT>: \"It's not the grades you make, it's the hands you shake.\"<financee>: The state schools are more prestigious than private schools and for 1/4 the price. That is the point. <WarDamn17>: That is not at all correct. It depends on the school and what you are studying.

A conversation in fi got me running numbers and I know am not sure this makes sense. I took 250k and compounded the interest annually for 25 years less the amount of the estimated total payout for the mortgage vs removing the mortgage payment and putting the estimated monthly payment amount into investments at the same annual compounding rate (6%) it appears option a means roughly 220k less total cash saved/earned over the term. Does this make sense? What am I missing?<DeluxeXL>: Option A (correct): If you park 250k in investments at 6% APY and use your take-home pay for the monthly mortgage payments ($1586.5521), you get: $250000*1.06^25 = $1072967.6799. But you miss out on 1586.5521 / month! How much is this opportunity cost in 25 years time? It's exactly the amount in Option B. ----------- Option B: If you instead pay down the entire mortgage immediately with the 250k cash you have, and invest $1586.5521 per month, you get: f(t months) = $1586.5521 + f(t-1)*(1+0.0584106/12) f(0 months) = $0 where 5.84106% is the monthly compounding APR to give equivalent 6% APY. f(300 months) = $1072967.6730 You get the same as Option A. The question is whether you rather have 250k in liquid cash/investment (option A) or not? <Elevation212>: Thank you! So the upside to paying off the mortgage early is avoiding the interest on the 250k? If that's the case would option b provide a net upside of roughly $170k?<DeluxeXL>: If your investment APY and mortgage APY are equal, you don't gain or lose any net worth after the same amount of time. By paying off the mortgage early, you avoid mortgage interest, but you also lose investment interest. APR being equal, the question is still whether you want more liquidity (cash/investment) or less monthly loan payment. In addition, other uncertainties play a huge role in whether to pay off mortgage early: Is your mortgage variable rate or fixed rate (Is interest rate going up)? Is the stock market going to have 6%/year? What if your income changes? What's your credit and can you borrow money against your house, at what rate? And finally taxes.

If you do decide to buy on credit, I would try to save up no less than 20% down and buy a used sedan from a manufacturer that makes long lasting cars and not buy new. Make sure the car payment is a very small part of your disposable income.

What should I look out for? Advice needed... I hope this is the right subreddit for this. I recently got a really good job offer from another company offering 20% more on salary with added benefits. My current employer has offered me 30% share of the business (small company with a turnover of 1 mil year) with an initial 10%, and 10% each year for 2 years. I have spoken to him about this and the intent is to sell the business in 3 years if possible. How does it work? If they sell the business in 3 years for X, do I get 30% of that lump sum? Does this depend on the share type? If so, what shares should I be looking out for in the contract? Any other clauses I should look to include? I don't quite trust the director which is causing the hesitance. I want to make sure my share would be protected and it yields some returns in the event of a sale. Otherwise the new job offer would be a much better option. Any advice? Any questions welcome, I'll do my best to respond ASAP. Thanks in advance <Edit>: Thank you for all the replies. I'll try go through them and feedback on any questions to help clarify. Really helpful! Edit 2: Quick update: I should have mentioned, my current employer does not know about the alternative job offer. Both events just kicked of at the same time. Edit 3: Thank you everyone for the brilliant advice!! Making a decision this week. Will keep you posted. Edit 4: Took the other Job offer :)<sometimescash>: I think the rule is always take the new job offer. Those who failed to see and compensate your value while you're there are not worth staying for and any pay increases and promises are just desperate attempts that usually don't pan out. Congratulations on the new job. Now go accept it. <ThereKanBOnly1>: This is really the best advice. OP made the decision to look for a new job for a reason. OP said that he/she got an amazing offer from that new employer. Take it. In most cases, any increase will just be to keep you around to find your replacement because you've made it clear that you will leave. In this case, shares of the business don't really indicate the business wanting to move you out, but you its still compensation that they only gave you when you threatened to leave. In fact, it makes leaving even harder because now the value of those shares are tied, in some sense, to your performance with the company. Leave. Enjoy the new job and the new opportunity. Its all business and just leave it at that.<ElCidTx>: Shares are an excellent way to build wealth. It 'might' make you money. The problem is, you've signaled your willingness to look elsewhere. Once you've done that, the leaders of your current company will NEVER(can't emphasize this enough) trust you again. If you stay, they'll find ways to push you down the hierarchy for perceived slights, when in reality, they simply quit trusting you after you solicited another offer. The analogy here is a bit like the wolf/pack comparison. It''s a threat to the leaders of your company that you dared question their ability to look out for you. You will very likely be sanctioned if you decide to stay. Enjoy the new position.<VinnieTheFish>: I've had shared in 12 different start ups over my career. One went public, 2 acquired by another company and the rest went belly up. The only one that made any money was the company that went public as I was an early employee. The 2 companies that were acquired were structured in a way that the primary investors made all the money and common stock was basically worthless or below the option price to purchase. In all situations at some point the percentage of shares I had in the company was diluted (sometimes multiple times) even before the one IPO. 30% now could equate to 30,000 shares today but a simple board decision to issue additional stock could easily dilute that to 1% of the company. Take the new job. Issuance of stocks or options does not guarantee future wealth.<quantum-mechanic>: I'm ignorant on these kind of deals so I would appreciate an explanation. If you owe some fixed percentage of a companies stock, how can the board simply 'decide' to dilute your portion? I mean, just dividing the stock increases total shares but you retain the same total percentage as you had. What you're describing sounds like theft.<mquillian>: When they increase shares, they don't necessarily just split yours to make more. Therefore, you may own 30k of 90k shares and then wake up to find you own 30k of 900k. At least, that's what I understand them to be saying. As to the legality of this, I'm pretty sure it's entirely permissible but I don't know enough to explain how at the moment so... take that bit with a grain of salt. I believe it has to do with the type of shares. Some offer protection against this sorry if thing, others don't. If I understand correctly, this is how some of the early Facebook founders got screwed?<mkramer4>: This is wrong. You cant just destroy shareholder value by issuing shares. If OP owns 10% and the owner owns 90%, then any shares that get issued need to be sold by either of these parties. If 150k new shares get issued, then either the owner sells them and reduces his share, you both sell them, or just OP sells them. Either way the owner of the shares gets paid rightly for them. The value or the percentage of company doesnt go down just because new shares are issued. <EDIT>: To the people downvoting me without even reading the article, firms are like a giant pie. No matter which way you slice it, the overall size of the pie doesnt change. Only increasing fcf or lowering your wacc increases the size of the pie.<osee115>: So you're saying the absolute only way to increase the existing number of shares is a split? <Edit>: [You appear to be wrong.](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp)<mkramer4>: Thats not what I said at all. <osee115>: &gt;You cant just destroy shareholder value by issuing shares. You can.

I spent the past two days reading through wikis, learning about backdoor Roth contributions, etc. and am exponentially more informed than I was last week. That said, I'm hoping for some advice getting my investments in order. Here is a rough breakdown of my accounts: * Brokerage: $50k (Schwab) * Roth IRA: $7k (Schwab) * 401k: $10k (John Hancock) * HSA: $1.5k * bitcoin: $6k (embarrassing, I know) **1. What should I do with my converted 401k?** My new employer does not do 401k matching, so yesterday I took my previous employer's 401k with John Hancock and submitted a request to convert it to a rollover IRA with Schwab (to avoid JH's maintenance fees). Now, should I keep this as a traditional IRA, or try to convert it to a Roth and pay the tax burden? The answer may hinge on question two, which is: **2. What's my best shot at contributing to my Roth this year?** I got a new job last year and I will now be just over the income limit for Roth contribution, even if I remove my annual $3k HSA contribution. If I convert my rollover IRA to a Roth I will need to pay income tax on that 401k, and if I make a $5500 IRA contribution I think I will have to pay taxes when I try to backdoor that to a Roth (due to my rollover IRA). Do I understand this correctly, and if so which direction would you recommend? **3. How should I move forward with my tanking / risky positions?** I want to remain long on 55% of my brokerage positions, but I'm not sure what to do with the remainder, as well as with my bitcoin (where I'm down $11k): ~30% of my brokerage positions have done very well over the past few years but are volatile / high-risk and another 15% of my holdings are down 25% in the year I've held them (though I still believe in the company's model, long-term). <dequeued>: 1. Roll your Traditional IRA money into your current 401(k). 2. Sell the bitcoin. 3. Follow the advice in \"I have $X...\" in the sidebar. Use a backdoor Roth IRA assuming you're over the Roth IRA income limits. If you do this correctly, there should be no taxes. Read [this article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/01/23/the-backdoor-roth-ira-advanced-version/) and [read this this tutorial](http://whitecoatinvestor.com/backdoor-roth-ira-tutorial/). 4. Pick funds in your 401(k) using the [fund selection guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k_funds). 5. Consider taking a capital loss on the bitcoin and your other losing positions and use that to sell appreciated positions without taxes. Move all of that money into low-cost index funds somewhere like Vanguard, Schwab, or Fidelity. This will reduce your volatility and make it easier to hold longer (to defer and reduce taxes). 6. Max out your 401(k) and IRA before adding any more into your taxable brokerage account as per the advice in \"I have $X...\". Allocate into your taxable account and other accounts with [tax-efficiency in mind](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement). <deltaqueue>: I opted out of my current employer's 401k because they do not match. That said, after reading those two articles it sounds like I should opt back in and move this rollover IRA in a new 401k because of the pro rata rule. Thanks for the heads up! <Re>: #6, would you suggest I simply park the money there, or keep making contributions even though there's no matching? <dequeued>: Continue making contributions assuming you reach that step in the \"I have $X...\" article. If you are saving as much as you are and you need a backdoor Roth IRA, that's a \"yes\".", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 1.75}

Luckily you live in California were you are better protected than what the Federal government covers. I was a software developer as well and I went through the same ordeal with a previous job. Simply put, there are several qualification that you must pass before you are considered exempt from overtime. The clearest one that you DO NOT meet is the pay rate. As of Jan 1, 2015, you must earn a minimum of $41.27 an hour to be exempt from OT. Your employer isn't going to want to pay you more, so please just tell them to look up the law on this. You want to look at California Labor Code Section 515.5. An employee must meet ALL of these conditions to be exempt. You clearly do not meet subsection 4. <http>://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=500-558 In that section they say the minimum rate will fluctuate yearly. Here is a link to that document that shows the 2015 rate as $41.27. <http>://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/LC515-5.pdf<factorialgrub>: I don't think he should tell his employer to look up the law. I think he should contact a lawyer or the state dol. This needs to be documented in case they can him because they're violating labor law and they see him as a threat.

However, they also won't hire someone who's filed such an action against an employer in the past, just in case. Why would they hire such a person, unless he's literally the only person who can do the job needed?<tekjester1>: Not even a little bit true. If a programmer is worth their weight, why would an employer care that they stood up for themselves instead of getting rolled over? This situation would never happen in 99% of companies. <kodemage>: &gt; If a programmer is worth their weight, why would an employer care that they stood up for themselves instead of getting rolled over? I should think that would be totally obvious... Because they don't have any clue that the allegations are true and it's better to avoid someone who could cause problems. I mean, come on. It's not a difficult concept and the practice is incredible common. <tekjester1>: How would it get brought up? You don't get fired for making \"allegations\" Anyone could cause problems, most people aren't illegally underpaid though. Really though, I have no idea what your comment is saying... What's totally obvious? What's not a difficult concept? What practice is common?

And background checks are purely criminal, per law. Things you'd know if you ever did any of this stuff instead of wildly speculating. <kodemage>: &gt; background checks are purely criminal, per law. Not true. Maybe that's your state but around here they also do things like look at public Facebook posts and query non-governmental databases like financial records and public records including, but not limited to, court records. Well, not the HR people but the company they pay to do the background checks. <tekjester1>: I worked for a MNC hiring in 12 states and even more countries. I worked in Global Operations. While it's true you *can* pull all those things, you can get yourself in serious trouble making hiring decisions based on unsubstantiated records, so why have the information on hand and put yourself in that position as a company? Credit Check, National Agencies Check, Local Checks, verify work history, verify education history, maybe a drug test depending on the position, that's it. <kodemage>: &gt; you can get yourself in serious trouble making hiring decisions based on unsubstantiated records If someone can prove that's how you made a decision, which is practically impossible. You can also get in serious trouble if you hire someone who ends up costing the company tons of money when they file a claim, whether or not the claim is substantiated. Many companies simply won't take that kind of risk because they don't have to. <tekjester1>: You don't have to prove that's how they came to the decision, you would merely have to prove that they asked or acquired the information, which is required under federal law. If the other person was similarly qualified and they had information on hand that was damaging but not allowable in a hiring decision, you could file a complaint with the EEOC or file a suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 if protected class discrimination doesn't apply. There were 88,000 EEOC charges filed in 2014 alone. That's charges filed, meaning they made it past the complaint and dispute charges and an EEOC officer felt there was enough evidence to file charges. This happens all the time, everywhere, and the complainants become gainfully employed elsewhere where illegal hiring and pay practices aren't occurring. <kodemage>: And nothing about the sheer number of complaints strikes you as a red flag that discriminatory practices are widespread? As you said, this doesn't even include cases where there may have been wrong doing but there wasn't enough evidence or where the discrimination was unreported because of the very real fear of retaliation. <tekjester1>: I didn't say it wasn't widespread, I said it wouldn't happen in 99% of companies. With a workforce size of 155,400,000, that'd put the complaint rate at .057% of the workforce - where it wouldn't be too far off to estimate represent about 1% of companies. <kodemage>: &gt; I said it wouldn't happen in 99% of companies. That's an extreme overestimation, given the number of complaints. You're naively optimistic about compliance. Your numbers are completely off because there are only about 20k businesses in the us where the vast majority of people work and no one is going to file a claim against a sole proprietorship.", "num_messages": 21, "avg_score": 23.5238095238}

It doesn't make a difference. I wouldn't change jobs for anything less than 20% - 30% more than current salary. Given that you'll be working more, I'd ask for at least 30% more. The key thing here is to take confidence from the fact that the worst they will do is turn you down. Also, they probably made this offer with the mindset that you're going to give them a counter offer anyways so they set it low to start to see if they could get lucky. If I were a betting man, I'd bet that you told them how much you make and they offered you that because they think you're desperate to change jobs for one reason or another.

At the very least, I would try to put a dollar amount to each benefit and subtract that from the 30%. So, if you decide the extra benefits are worth 10% more, then only ask for a 20% pay raise.<chattyyogalady>: I updated it a bit in the original post.

We make $130k gross combined, and have no CC debt, but 400 a month in student loan payments (90k total at 3%), and one car payment of $250 (9k balance at 2.5%) for another 3 years (other car is paid off). Have 25k savings and 30k in retirement. Plan is use about 10k of cash savings for down payment and closing costs, and leave the rest for emergency fund. Our rent is $950 and new house payment will be about $1850 ( at 4% interest and with PMI and taxes and insurance). We currently save around 30k a year but with new home payment and adding in for home repair/maintenance expenses we're estimating this will drop to 15k annually. Our current plan would be to focus on paying off car loan first and then split annual savings between increasing emergency fund/retirement and paying off home. A little about the home. Its 12 years old and is move in ready without any work. Utilities will be about the same. To my wife and I this sounds like a reasonable plan. We could wait another year before we buy and save more for down payment but we have been working 10 years to get our debt and income to where it is now and feel now is the time. We'd greatly appreciate though some alternative perspectives and ideas though, thanks! <Edit>: Thanks guys for the advice/perspectives. Definitely agree this is more of emotional decision than rational. Some background, we lost a business 5 years ago and have rebuilt credit and paid off a lot debt (65k), and this is why we still are not quite to a solid PF situation. 2 years and we would be in great position but we're renting in a small house for past 4 years, and just emotionally ready for a win in life. The new house is 2000 sqft above grade and another 800 sqft finished below. Definitely a nicer, nearly new quality home and we could go cheaper by up to 75k but this home is move in ready and does not have anything needing work/repairs. In our area you can get down to maybe 175k home for what we are looking for but would be getting much lower quality and/or older and inefficient house. <joelhardi>: Maybe I'm missing something, but your net worth is like negative 50K, and you want to double your monthly housing expense? I don't get it at all ... maybe you're not explaining something like that this would be moving from a studio to a 4BR, but even then an extra grand a month is a lot, enough to wipe out your debt in 5 years. 30-year FHA loan with close to nothing down and MI for the life of the loan, you will effectively own nothing. Except a large, long-term debt obligation. You're much better off renting for $1600 or more a month, or even better, the $950 you're paying now. If you want to splurge on your housing, that's fine, but financially this is terrible. I do not mean to be harsh, but I just almost spit a mouthful of cereal onto the keyboard when I started reading. I suggest you wait another year and reassess (and then hopefully wait another year ...).

That's a pretty low price for a functional car without immediate repair needs. Perhaps you need to change the budget?

I am one of the unlucky ones living in Texas right now. Saturday was a blast. I had a car accident AND my living room flooded in the torrential rain. I have questions about what I'm supposed to do now. This is my first car accident and I have no idea how to handle it. I was driving through a neighborhood and a teenager backed his mom's car out of his driveway and into my car. Damage was very minor. I've got a dent and my wheel is scratched. I'm debating whether it's even worth it to report it to the insurance company. Is there a time limit for reporting an accident? It happened on Saturday. I requested an estimate from a shop today and should have a response by tomorrow. I mean, I could probably pop the dent out myself, but since I'm not at fault I'm more inclined to take it to a shop since I believe that means the other person's insurance will be paying for it. That being said, I'm 26 and have a great driving record. Is having an accident (even not at fault) going to affect my rate? As for my house: I bought my house in November (first time homeowner). On Saturday, we had a tremendous amount of rain and a tornado in the area. I don't think the tornado came near my house, but there were still strong winds. The wind blew up one of my roof panels and water leaked into my living room. Luckily nothing important was damaged. From the inside of my living room, there doesn't appear to be any damage to the ceiling. You can't even tell there was a leak. I am concerned about what's going on in the attic, though. I'm going to check it out tomorrow. I figure my choices for the house are: 1) Nail the roof panel back down myself 2) File an insurance claim and have a professional do it. I am worried about filing a claim because I've heard horror stories about people who have had insurance for years being dropped after filing 1 claim. Is there any truth to this? Do I have anything to worry about? My boyfriend says that I should file a claim because mine will be a drop in the bucket with all the other damage that happened that night.<ChrisLW>: Car first: there's no concern to your policy for filing a claim. I assume you got the kid's info who backed into you? You'll need that info to file the claim. You may surprised how much a small dent can end up being to repair from a reputable body shop. The house: This is a little more tricky. Yeah, you could just nail down the shingle, and hope for the best. But a professional roofer could tell you whether the shingle is damaged, or if any of the roof decking may need to be replaced. The other concern is getting everything dry, lest you end up with a mold issue. Same goes for the stuff inside your house. As for the concern about dropping, it *is* a concern, but being dropped by your carrier. But that's minimized here by the size of your claim; your boyfriend is right in this case, and heck, the carrier could drop you just because of a lot of claims in the area. Living in Texas myself, the risk of drop is somewhat low; I've never been dropped, and even had two claims on my last house. The tradeoff is that it's relatively easy for insurers to tell the state they're increasing rates, and the state's Office of Public Insurance pretty much rubber stamps the request. Good luck!<insurancequst>: Yes, I got his mom's insurance info and phone number. So I call their insurance company, not mine? Regarding the house, I'm reading my policy and I'm confused. It says \"This notice is to advise you that your policy excludes coverage for damage due to Flood or Earthquake, unless you purchase coverage for these perils. Flood includes surface water, waves, tidal water, tidal waves, storm surge, **wind driven water** (including hurricane winds), or any other overflow of water, and spray from any of these events. To be covered for such a loss, you will have to obtain a separate flood insurance policy through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).\" It also says: \"This peril does not cover:... \"b. loss caused by rain, snow, sand or dust, whether or not driven by wind, unless the direct force of wind or hail makes an opening in the roof or wall and the rain, snow, sand or dust enters through this opening and causes the damage.\" If the wind hadn't blown the roof tile up, the roof wouldn't have leaked. I think this means that I'm covered, but I'm worried that they're going to try to deny my claim. I have a $1,000 deductible which says \"Subject to all perils.\" I know I need a professional to assess the damage, but I really can't see it costing more than $1,000. Should I get an estimate before filing a claim? Is there any reason to file a claim if the repair will be less than $1,000?<ChrisLW>: Car: If you've got the other person's insurance, call them first. If they'll handle directly without involving your carrier, it might be easier. If they stonewall, call yours, and provide the other carrier info, and let them go after them (that's what you pay them for). <House>: Your logic is correct - the roof damage should be covered, because, as you said, had wind not blown off the roof, you wouldn't have water damage. And yes, if the damage is less than $1000 (or whatever your deductible happens to be), then there's no sense in opening a claim.", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 1.5}

How am i able to take out a student loan and use it for personal use, and when do i start paying it back, even though i might have it paid back in a couple of months.<Galen00>: FAFSA. https://fafsa.ed.gov/ Fill it out and see what you can get. You do not want private student loans, only government loans are safe. With government loans you have income based repayment and debt forgiveness if you ever fail to have a good income, they won't ruin your life. With private loans, any hiccup = your life is ruined the debt just keeps going and will destroy you. You don't want private loans. If you need temporary money and can't get a fafsa loan, look into a credit card. Credit card debt sucks too, but at least you can deal with it in bankruptcy and if the loan is truly only for a few months, this shouldn't matter. If you are trying to essentially pay your bills for the summer and have no job, I would suggest enrolling to summer school with online classes and using fafsa to pay for it.<Matthew_V95>: Thought fasfa was through school and has to be used for school. I need money for tests/licenses and clothes for work and ect. I assumed student loans would be best because i wouldn't have to pay until at least when i graduate.<Galen00>: It is for school and living expenses while you are enrolled. It covers everything. My tuition was 9k and I was eligible for up to 18k in loans. After tuition is paid, the rest goes to your account. Fafsa loans are student loans. But they are through the government and government loans have income based repayment and debt forgiveness after 20 years. So if you have low income or no income, they won't ruin you. Also the loans through fafsa can be subsidized, which means interest doesn't accrue while you are still in school. This makes them cheaper. Private loans on the other hand require full payment no matter what. If you lose your job, you are forced to default, ruining your credit for anything else and the debt will grow and grow until they decide to put in for wage garnishment. You do not want private student loans, private student loans are a cancer. Private student loans technically make you pay before you graduate, they just defer the interest, so when you graduate the loan is bigger.<Matthew_V95>: Ok ill check into it, but how long does it usually take till you figure out how much you cam get and use it.<Galen00>: You won't get it until after the school year starts since it is a student loan. Usually by the first or second week the funds are distributed.<Matthew_V95>: Yeah see i need it in about a couple of weeks<Galen00>: You can sign up for summer school and try to get living expenses with it through fafsa. Finding some private loan company to give you money that obviously isn't for school should be fun. If you find someone, I bet it has a high interest rate.<Matthew_V95>: I'm signed up for summer classes and last day to do fasfa was couple weeks ago, saw signs at school, but ill double check<Galen00>: Just go to the fafsa website and sign up right now.

So when I have mine built, I'll request the contractor to leave some things to me (paint interior/exterior, flooring, kitchen appliances, countertops and tile work). A friend of ours built his house this way, and he paid about $50 per sq ft and I plan on building 3000 sq ft. So I don't think a bank would lend, because they wouldn't like the default risk of taking over a half finished home lol. <Galen00>: Don't get a mortgage just to invest into the stock market. Stock returns are not guaranteed, there is no reason to take this risk. Buy your house in cash and then just save money after you buy it and invest that if you want to invest. Secure your living situation before you start investing. It is silly to get a mortgage at 4% and then invest to get 5-7%. That is a lot of risk for 1-3% in returns. Too many people on here will flat out tell you to get the mortgage and risk your money for a 1% return, but it really isn't a good idea.<dgreenmachine>: 1% return? You should be comparing 4% mortgage to **10%** the stock market has returned historically. That's not 1% difference, that's 6%!! You may be thinking of inflation adjusted return which has been 5-7% long term. And if you don't touch the money for a long time its much less risky, infact its a great decision. Everything in life has risks, you could get hit by a bus tomorrow. This is a very good bet that will work out in favor of investing 99% of the time.<Galen00>: &gt;1% return? You should be comparing 4% mortgage to 10% the stock market has returned historically The stupidity on this forum can be off the charts. What you talk about is meaningless until you list exactly what magical fund he should invest in that will gain 10% for sure every year over 30 years. If you can't name that fund and cannot offer that guarantee, you are nothing more than a terrible person. There is absolutely no reason for this guy to risk losing his house to gain 1-3% a year on the stock market. That is probably something like 50 dollars a month. You want him to risk losing his house to earn 50 dollars a month in interest. You have to be fucking nuts to tell someone to do that. Give up all financial stability to possibly gain 50 dollars a month. The notion is laughable. &gt;This is a very good bet that will work out in favor of investing 99% of the time. And if it fails, you lose your house that you otherwise could have owned. All for a max return of 50 dollars a month.<dgreenmachine>: Risk losing his house... He has a job and making a mortgage payment is not difficult, he's saving 75% of his income. He is at near zero risk of losing the house. Noone said 10% guaranteed, i said 10% historically which is true. I'd rather have an extremely high chance of 6-10% return over a long term than a guaranteed chance for 4%. Why do you think he would lose his house if the stock market goes down? He doesn't even have to sell his investments to cover the mortgage since he has a job and saves 75% of his income.<Galen00>: I don't know who you are or what your game is, but risking all your money to squeak out 50 dollars a month is seriously retarded.

They will be commission-free, as it's their own fund and they make money off you in the expense ratio. But because it's an index fund, the expenses are stupid low. **If you're rich**: Bank of America-Merill Lynch and some other brokerages have 'benefits packages' for customers with large account sizes--typically starting at 25,000 or 50,000. This grants free trades. BoA's is 100 free trades per year for those with 100k of assets. They make it free for you because they are going to try to get you to agree to pay 1% of your portfolio per year to have a \"vice president\" manage your shit for you. And you have the power to say no thanks, and never pay them for this, but lots of people say yes. And then buy a bunch of ETFs with even lower fees than the mutual funds, which are also more liquid which is nice. Also credit card and checking account benefits! **If you're stupid**: Use robinhood or another app that is 'commission free' because it doesn't use the same spread every fee-based brokerage used. Spoiler alert, the money made on margin interest is shit, and if they're not charging you per trade then you are paying more per share than you would with another brokerage (\"bid/ask spread\"). Instead of seeing the $8 fee, you're paying a much higher fee, and just not seeing it. Yeah, shots fired. <t2mcat>: How quickly can I get my money out of a Vanguard/Fidelity/whatever fund? Is it days/weeks/months/years?<Ener_Ji>: For [Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/accountservices/banking): &gt; With electronic bank transfers, you control which day your money is invested or assets are sold. Just submit a transfer before the close of the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4 p.m., Eastern time) and you'll get that day's closing price. If you then need to transfer that money to your checking account, count on that taking an additional business day or two.<t2mcat>: Thank you. The reason I ask is I figure I can keep in my savings account only as much as I need for the amount of time it'd take to liquidate my fund assets, if I were to have sudden and significant financial needs (get fired). The rest I could put in a Vanguard fund, to maximize the benefit of having the money. I assume you can make incremental deposits into a fund like this, where the increments are the size of one share, yes?<MileyCylon>: One of the reasons that r/PF recommends using a savings account instead of a brokerage account for your emergency fund is that the brokerage account can suddenly lose money. Is it likely that the account would lose a bunch of money right before you need it? No. Would that be a big problem if it happened? Maybe.<t2mcat>: Oh, that's something I hadn't thought of. If you put enough in there though, it's not like you're going to lose *half* or anything so dramatic, right? If you account for the fact that you *might* lose, say, 10%-15% during a downswing which might coincide during a need, then even at a time of need you'd be alright. I guess the downside of this is normally you can ride those downswings out, but you can't if you need the cash. What's the absolute worst-case scenario? All of your emergency fund goes up in smoke in a 1929-style market crash?<Pzychotix>: Err, considering that growth/loss works on percentages, it doesn't really matter how much you put in. The chance of losing 50% on $100 is the same as the chance of losing 50% on $100k. It all depends on what you invest in, not how much.<t2mcat>: It matters a great deal how much you put in, if you're trying to maintain a \"minimum\" absolute value for \"emergency funds\". In a crude example, 10% of $30k lost puts a person at $27k, which is still more than 25k, which we can call enough to survive for 6 months (it's an example, the actual value doesn't matter, could also be N), and thus still functions as an emergency fund. However, 10% of 26k lost puts a person down to $23.4k, which is no longer above the 25k threshold we arbitrarily decided to pick as our \"emergency fund limit\". So yes, it matters a great deal how much you put in.<justthrowmeout>: Even still, if you put in the larger amount, you're being forced to sell at a loss. That's why PF pushes the idea of a liquid emergency fund. Investments are best for the long term.<t2mcat>: How often do you expect to dip into your emergency fund? Emergencies happen rarely, that's the very definition of the term. Most of the time (years and years, potentially), that emergency fund just sits there, doing basically nothing. I just don't see how \"years and years\" isn't a long term.<justthrowmeout>: I'm not sure what you're asking. The philosophy is to set aside a few months worth of expenses in a cash account. It's not doing nothing. You might be young because after a certain amount of life experience, you'll find that shit happens. It's providing you completely liquid cash in the case of an emergency. You don't have to sell stocks at a loss to get it. You don't have to sell stocks at a gain and take on income tax liability The money can be in an interest bearing checking account and it also diversifies your holdings by allocating some portion to cash. Emergency can be defined broadly. Perhaps the stock market crashes and you have an urgent opportunity to buy some shares at a deep discount. Cash will do that for you<t2mcat>: How many times a year do you dip into your emergency fund?<justthrowmeout>: Rarely. I try to avoid emergencies. But stuff happens. Are you saying it doesn't? Do you want examples? Unexpected property insurances increases, rental vacancies, buying opportunities in the market, car accident, job loss, maybe unexepcted purchase need. etc etc etc.<t2mcat>: If you only touch an emergency fund on a rare basis, wouldn't it make more sense to put that money somewhere it could earn you better returns while it's doing nothing?<justthrowmeout>: Like what?<t2mcat>: Like a Vanguard Index Fund, which is what I originally asked about, heh.<justthrowmeout>: You can employ this strategy but it's risky. <t2mcat>: Everything carries risk, that's a nonstatement.", "num_messages": 19, "avg_score": 60.8947368421}

In the jurisdiction where I took the bar, the rule was that gifts are marital property *unless* specified otherwise. While it is certainly possible in many jurisdictions to specify a gift to one spouse but not both, in practice, it could be difficult to prove intent and to also prevent that asset from tolling against the class of marital property. It's better to wait for the divorce, or to gift the assets in the form of a trust. <NancyTron13>: He did not say where his brother was. I practice family law in GA and a letter/email of intent as suggested would work pretty well here. I think a trust is overkill, but it really depends on his state. <doggyfur>: It's really heavily state dependent. For all we know, they could be in a community property state.

As the title says, I plan on buying a new vehicle soon. I make 81k a year (straight salary, no bonuses or anything) and besides a past car loan (an order of magnitude less than I am trying to finance now, 3.5k then, 22ish k now and also paid off early) and a student loan (paid off very early) I have no credit history besides years of good payment on utility bills (worthless, I know). My question is, this, I intend to buy a car fairly soon (down payment will be cashout of vacation and sick time from previous job plus trade-in and maybe another 1k). Anyway, as I do not have a credit card, and it is past due for me to get one, I would like to go ahead and do that soon as well. I have at least one international and several domestic trips coming up in my intermediate future and want to be better prepared. I have always lived within my means and had a credit union that took great care of me, so I never felt the need for a credit card. I also didn't fully understand them well enough and didn't want to commit the time to learning how to properly use them so I just never bothered with it. Anyway, in my research it seems that one of the drivers of credit score is credit check history. Obviously, since I will be getting a new vehicle soon (lease or buy), they will check my credit. I was hoping to get this card sometime this summer (maybe the Barclay's SallieMae or Amazon) as well. Will having my credit checked for the car loan (I will probably go through my credit union, they have great rates and my parents were charter members) have a bigger impact or potentially hurt me for a tougher to acquire card like the SallieMae? I'm not really looking for advice on the best way to get the vehicle itself yet. I need to talk to the dealer about what my actual options are and I will do the math myself, I'm mostly just curious about how it will affect my credit score and ability to get a decent credit card in the near future.<Endlessxo>: I think you should open up your credit card asap. Demonstrate that you are responsible by paying your bills on time and staying below a certain credit utilization. You credit score will go up over time, and you will find yourself at a much favorable position when you go to your dealership and ask for financing / leasing options. <warner62>: In a more ideal world, I would absolutely agree. Unfortunately, between fiscal depreciation and mechanical degradation, I really need to get rid of my current vehicle ASAP. I am also looking to get a vehicle that is coming out with a new redesign for 2016 and I would really prefer to have the older model before the price range. If I finance to buy, it will most definitely be from my credit union, where I will probably get a great choice anyway, but for the lease, I would say you are correct.

I found [this link](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_stock_market) that discusses how to approximate VTSMX.

As to what happens on death, that depends what the loan contract says, however the usual result is banks and finance companies get all of their money out of the estate, along with revenue and of course death duties if they are payable. Letting you drive the car does not mean it's yours unless the title was transferred to you which would have been impossible with money owing on it. <moewh>: Well its myself and my mother dealing with it (next of kin) but there is no estate, nothing left over except credit card debts which are again in his name, and no will/inheritance. But I;ll check with loan contract and see if there is anything about death there.<TKCerbs>: It saddens me to learn that people retire and die not just broke, but in debt. I hope your mother is doing ok.<tipsystatistic>: Why? If I had to choose, I'd rather spend a million than save a million. You can't take it with you.<NoggleBoggle>: That's a burden you leave on rest of the society. Our economy would fare much better for us and our future generations if everyone had positive net worth.<EDEN786>: For people to be better off others will be worse off.<kartoffel123>: That's not how our economy works. That's not how any of this works.<IHaveNoMicrowave>: &gt; That's not how our economy works.

You gave a great example right here: it's a win-win situation, that's how trading benefits everyone.<IHaveNoMicrowave>: I'm just pointing out that their lives are made worse so yours can be better.

Hell I eat red meat and delicious bacon, I look at my huge TV that cost me a fraction of what it should and accept the fact that someone on the far side of the world is staring at an old black and white tube TV while choking down water polluted by the tailings of the local rare earth mine. But I do understand that is how the economy works on a world scale. I'm happy, they're not. They could be happy, but then I would be unhappy, and I don't want to be unhappy. Hell, I don't do what I can to make this world a better place except for those in my immediate surroundings, and that's because I personally benefit from that because then I don't hear them whining. I do have a suggestion for you though: When trying to understand something, disassociate yourself from the ethics of it and you will find you gain a broader grasp of it.<kartoffel123>: &gt; But I do understand that is how the economy works on a world scale. I'm happy, they're not. They could be happy, but then I would be unhappy, and I don't want to be unhappy. You're mistaken, that's not how the economy works. Wouldn't you agree that nearly everyone is a lot better off than 50 years ago? Money is not a limited resource, but one that grows with global wealth. You can increase wealth by creating something with your work, by inventions, by trading etc. etc.<burrito_batman>: Everyone that you know of, why don't you work in a third world country for a year and still claim noone suffers to help someone else succeed in the world economy.<kartoffel123>: Sorry, where exactly did I claim that noone suffers working in third world countries?<burrito_batman>: &gt; I'm just pointing out that their lives are made worse so yours can be better. Nope, both our lives are made better by trading his work (which I want) against my money (which he wants). To produce cheap electronics people in third world countries work like slaves, if we paid them a fair wage and gave them equal work conditions that we have then electronic prices would skyrocket and not be anywhere near as affordable as they are now. By them working in terrible conditions allows you to have a cool phone, big TV etc without having to spend a ton of money<kartoffel123>: Look, all I wanted to say in this thread is that the comment &gt; For people to be better off others will be worse off. is wrong from an economical standpoint. There are many situations were two parties can both be better off through trading.

Hello r/personalfinance! I've been lurking for a while and now I think it's time for me to ask questions about what bothers me money-wise in the future since I plan to move to Los Angeles. Long story short: I'm from Qu\u00e9bec Canada. I speak both french and english. It's my last year in bio-informatics at the university. Next year, my girlfriend and I want to move to L.A. so she can pursue her dream of becoming an actress. By that time, I will be 24 and she will be 21. So there it is. My gf's father is gonna help her pay for school there at first, but I feel I have to contribute and plan our future properly. I'm used to make small budgets (for school expenses, appartement, food, etc.) but now that it's in an other country on the other side of the continent, I feel I need some help planning it all, or at least going in the right direction. I can provide information about us and our plans if you guys feel it's not quite clear. What is the best way to start planning our life? Thank you and have a nice day :) <EDIT>: spelling Edit 2: Wow I didn't expect that many quality answer! I'm sorry I had to work late so I couldn't reply quickly. I hope you guys can still help :) I read all the comments and I think I should explain the initial \"plan\" better. My gf is a very lucky girl. Her dad is willing to pay for her education and since she really wants to work as an actress or maybe something related to cinema, she obviously wants to go to LA. She says it's her dream and that not many people have the chance she has to actually try it. We've been together for 2 years now and she's doing everything she can to make this work (English classes, singing classes, dancing classes, name it she's done it). I know some of you will say it's not enough but I believe she can do it. She knows it's VERY UNLIKELY it will work out exactly as she plans but she's going anyway. For those wondering, she is looking into New York Film Academy for the school, so we'll probably stay somewhere near that place, I don't know yet I will ask her later I know she looked where was the best place considering money/safety. For my part, I know I will need a VISA to work in the US. Part of my question concerning the planning we have to do is related to my work: Can I actually get a VISA for a bioinformatic job, come to the US and THEN find a job? Or do I have to find a job from here, and then get a VISA accordingly? I'm a little confused on that part. I'm a lifeguard here and I also worked as a vendor in a sports shop. Will this help me in any way if I want to find a small job at first? We know it will be a very hard part of our life but we're adventurous and we really want to make this work. We have the opportunity and like my girlfriends says, we don't want to regret not at least trying it. Plus we're TIRED of the snow, eheh. I will be up for the next couple hours so I hope some of you will be able to help us again :) Thanks a lot! <NlogN20>: LA native here. 28 years old and make about 175k USD. A few things to consider: 1. Even I have a hard time finding a decent place that doesn't make my eyeballs blow out my head in price. Expect rent for a nice'ish area (Westside) to be at least 2k a month minimum for a 1 bdrm. 2. With no job lined up, and point above, you are setting yourself up for serious financial hardships. I know it sounds fun to move here, but keep that in mind when you live in an apartment with bars on the windows, drug dealers outside the gate, and your car is broken into. 3. Traffic is insane. Absolutely insane. Nothing like Toronto (I've visited). Toronto is nice actually compared to LA traffic. So if your plan is to live in a more remote area and commute into the city, enjoy waking up at 4 30 am every day (yes, I've done this) and having a commute of upwards of 2-3 hours on the way home (depending on how far out you live). 4. Jobs that pay well in LA are hard to come by unless you are skilled labor (STEM or trade). There are literally hundreds of thousands of people just like your gf fighting for the dream of being an actor. Several of my friends have done this and have had to take jobs as part time bartenders or waiters at night (think the 8 pm to 4 am shift). It's hard. Really hard. That being said, if this doesn't deter you, good luck. I hope to see your gf on the silver screen. \ud83d\ude04<throwawaynewjob12get>: holy shit im moving to La in a few months with a salary of 90k, and your post scares me.<NlogN20>: I pretty much made 90k a couple years ago. I maxed out my 401k and after that I was pulling maybe 2350 semimonthly. I know some frugal people here will try to tell you that you can get a 1 bdrm for 1600, but realistically if you are young and want to have fun, that isn't happening. Try closer to 2000-2300 for rent near Santa Monica/marina del Rey or 2500 in downtown (you have to pay this much as downtown is generally shit). So basically expect half your monthly paycheck to go to rent (not including utilities). That is unless you want to commute in. Currently I'm commuting in from OC because of family. I go to Santa Monica blvd off the 405 every day. I have a carpool sticker car, and eve with that if I leave after 5 15 am or after 2 30 pm in the afternoon you are looking at 1-1.5 hours each way. It's horrible and I can't honestly recommend it. Sorry if that's scary, it's the truth. I've lived in frugal areas and if you at all want a gf staying with you, you won't want to live in those areas. TLDR 90k isn't that much to live on in LA. It's closer to about 50k in middle America if you adjust for horrible traffic. <throwawaynewjob12get>: thanks for the info.", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 3.2}

Need your help in getting rid of my financed car Hi, I have a 2013 Corolla, that i bought brand new in Dec 2012. I've been making payments, but money is tight, and i want to get rid of it. I guess it's been ~2.5 years, and I want to get rid of it and not pay for it anymore since i financed (0%) it. say the remaining amount is 10k. What value of a car do i need to trade in for, to not be able to make any more payments? *Confused*<Galen00>: You may be able to sell it privately to cover what you owe, but that is it. You will have to find a private buyer willing to get their own loan to pay for it. If you need to sell it for more than you owe so you can buy another car, this isn't going to happen. Any deal you make with a dealer will probably leave you with a similar payment to the one you have now because 0% interest is only for new cars. Any loan you get in a swap deal will have a much higher rate. A dealer will probably offer you some kind of really terrible deal that just barely lowers your payments and leaves you with a shitty car. If you need a car to get to work, keep the reliable one you have. Don't do any garbage deal at a dealer so you can make a slightly lower payment and drive a car that is 15 years old.<IPLEADDAFIFTH>: If the market value is say 13k, and I owe, 9-10k, i should be ok than right? <Galen00>: You have to sell it. Are cars actually being sold for 13k? kbb should have a private sale number an not the higher blue book number. Price your car as if you are someone trying to figure out how much they should pay for that kind of car. You should go to a dealership or two just to see what they would offer as a baseline, but they will always offer less than they can sell it for. If you are lucky, they will be willing to buy it for what you owe. That could save you time as who knows how easy it will be to sell this car on the private market. I have never deal with a private market sale of a 10k car. Maybe this is easy, maybe it isn't. I don't know the mileage, but kbb claims the private party range is 11.5k-12k. In theory you should be able to get rid of this car and cover your loan. &gt;I guess it's been ~2.5 years, The sad thing is you paid more than enough to cover half the value of the car and you still owe 10k.", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 0.75}

Did you read the post about the guy who was paying 640 a month for his truck and 350 a month for his wifes car? 1k a month in car payments, he lost his oilrig job which cut his pay in half and now his family is going to be homeless because of those car payments. Sure he had the money to be reckless, but if he wasn't reckless, he would have 400 dollars tops for the car payments (or most likely had paid both cars off already) and his family would not be risking homelessness. They would have bills they could afford and a very large bank account for emergencies. He decided to max out what he could afford for stupid vehicles for no reason and now his family will be living in that truck soon. This guy doesn't need to splurge on an old ass luxury car that will have expensive repair bills. He could instead splurge on a brand new car for around 15k and have a vehicle that will last him 15 years.<ArmTheHomelesss>: So you just proved a point. Putting payments in for a brand new car is much more dangerous then buying a used car. <Galen00>: Yes, I proved the point that buying a new car for the same price as an old ass luxury car is a much better splurge.", "num_messages": 10, "avg_score": 0.2}

My risk tolerance is high enough that I am comfortable with bond proxies like REIT's and preferred shares. My method still requires some active engagement and OP asked for a passive investment. However, as a rough estimation, one could have bought the BND etf to use this method. Over the last 12 months, it gave a net yield (post-tax) of 2.4%, or about half a percent above inflation. Since its inception (2006) the etf has delivered a post-tax return of 5% which is considerably higher than inflation. <vagina_fang>: I'd do some more research the best returns investing lie in taking a passive approach with almost one hundred percent equities. The risk reward on active investing just isn't there historically.<wanmoar>: OP asked for passive income, not passive return. If you want to know what you're going to get over the life of the investment, bonds are where you go.<vagina_fang>: What is the different between passive return and passive income? I've never heard it differentiated like you just did. <wanmoar>: p income = spending money (dividends, interest, royalties, rent) p return = market value of holding (unbooked capital gain/loss, net worth), no income stream<vagina_fang>: But equities give out dividends, so your only bond method for income makes no sense. <wanmoar>: equity dividends are neither fixed nor guaranteed. If you bought shares of Bank of America in 2008, you would have started out with a dividend of $0.64/sh but from 2009 onwards you would received only $0.01/sh. If an investor bought 100 shares in 2008, they saw their income cut from $256 a year to $4 a year. By contrast, if you bought a BAC bond in 2008, you have continued receiving a constant stream of interest @ 4% of your initial investment. So if you were counting on your passive income, equity only investors were screwed but bond holders stil had the same income flowing in.<vagina_fang>: Right. I think you are using extreme examples of single equity holdings that have sudden decreasing dividends. There are equal examples that pay double the dividends they promised initially after a few years. Or increasing every year. I get your point, but buying ETFs you won't have this volatility and will have an approximate dividend income stream that you can rely on. So I get your point but feel it's not really accurate.<wanmoar>: yeah you would. Here's the [dividend info for SPY](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/spy/dividend-history), the S&amp;P 500 ETF. As you can see, there have been some significant shifts in dividend payouts per share. From $1.50 in 2000 to $0 in 2009 and back to $3 today. If I were looking for an investment which I could 'hang my hat' on, equity dividends would not be it. I should, at this in stage our discussion, emphasize that OP said, **\"in your opinion\"**, I gave mine. If you're having such a hard time believing my opinion, perhaps the most prudent course of action is to ignore me and move on.<vagina_fang>: Right. Well I just trying to engage in a conversation and correct you, because you seem to not grasp that \"safe\" equities give you a good income stream \"on average\". Average out the dividend payments over time and take into account the growth of the holding. It will beat bonds hands down every time over a 10, 20 or 80 year period. In regards to the income it produces. You seem to be reasonably intelligent so thought you would appreciate me pointing out your mistake. But you're absolutely right, it's your opinion and you are certainly entitled to it. <wanmoar>: I'm probably stupid enough to miss your 'intelligent advice'. I mean, I only have the evidence of seeing 25% of my expense be covered by passive income streams. Who knows...I may have just been lucky...for the last 11 years. /s<vagina_fang>: I can only point to the fact that you would have gotten a better income return through stocks. Because the value of stocks increase so the dividend percentage may stay the same or decrease but the amount will get bigger. 4% on $100 versus 3% on $300. Right? You seem to have an attitude so we'll leave it here shall we. Just know that if you're using the income generated from your bonds, you're losing to inflation once you bring tax into the equation.

This is important information to have because as my VAG qualified mechanic puts it, \"something was lost in translation over at VW\". The Passat in particular is a problem child in the VW family. Unless you have the TDI you're going to experience more and more trouble as your car ages. I swear every time I pull into the shop there are at least two Passats on the lifts. \"They keep us in business\", says my mechanic friend. If your car is driveable (and safe to drive) start saving and drive it into the ground. Then buy something better with cash. You are not going to want a car paper and school loans at the same time. If the car is really beyond repair and you have a couple thousand on hand now, go ahead and get that transmission rebuilt. It'll be one less thing to worry about down the road. <Deitaro>: I just hope I can get my car to the repair place for maintenance. I feel like it will overheat if I drive it to long because the transmission, but like I said I have to drive at least an hour to get it to where I need to get it fixed because noone wants to touch a VW where I live.<starter_kit>: I should have asked... how many miles on the car?<Deitaro>: Alittle over 111k<starter_kit>: Yeah, I can see why you are feeling some stress on this. There used to be a theory that once a car hit a certain age/mileage it would start hemorrhaging parts/issues but after dropping a grand or so you could usually stop the bleeding for a while. From what I understand the Passat starts this process early and I don't know if you will ever get over the hump to the point that you aren't needing constant repairs. The fact that you have to drive an hour for parts/labor is a big problem so if you have $6k I'd say go get yourself something else and worry about your business start up costs down the road. You have a family that needs reliable transportation and you need reliable transportation for school. <Deitaro>: I appreciate all the words of wisdom. I am already looking around to maybe get another car. Hopefully I can find something that every mechanic can work on and not get anything too old. Hopefully the car doesn't give out on me on the way to a place I can trade it in at that has something I want.", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 0.7142857143}

(lengthy post) I'm a 30 year old male, high school dropout. I have one kid,and an SO, who helps me out with EVERYTHING. I've been working in retail ever since I was 22, yet I've never made more than 10.55 an hour. I was pretty bad with money, decision making, thinking, hell everything in my twenties. I wasn't disciplined enough to save a dime, and ended up with $5,800 in credit card debt that has now been in collections for almost two years. About 3 years into my stint with retail, after finally getting promoted, I came to the conclusion that I absolutely hated it. I ended up getting my GED at 24, enrolled in community college and found out that school was easy relative to actual life. My GPA was stellar, and after 3 years I was given the opportunity to transfer to a state school with a major in Accounting. I've already taken out loans, to the tune of about $13,000. After this next year, I should be around $25,000 in student loans. I have one year and 7 months until graduation. I estimate that I will come out of college with about $30,000 in loans, which is extremely high for the small amount of time I have spent at the state school, I know. The job prospects are wonderful for my major though, and the odds are that I will at least start at around $40,000 a year. To be honest, if I were to stay in retail I would have topped out at around $40,000 a year, miserable and bitter, now even more so after seeing that 22 year old interns make double what I make after 10 years of work. With this Degree I feel like my opportunities are a bit better, even at my age. I want the opinions of you all though, who seem much more successful than me. Was it a good idea to go back to school? In your opinion, even with ten years less of return potential, is the ROI worth it?<pythagoreanmetronome>: Yes it sounds like you are really focused on the status a particular type of office job will give you. That's totally inside you though. So you get a different job. You will still feel like you feel now because those feelings come from inside you and are not a part of your external circumstances. It sounds like you need to get it together really.<ManicMoney>: I do need to get it together, like yesterday. It really isn't the status of the job, even though the plush highrises are nice, the cities are fabulous, and the amenities omg..., but that's beside the point. In retail, there are no opportunities besides store manager unless you work there for 20 plus years. The work is monotonous, you learn nothing. You remain stagnant, and the people who work under you are the mostly unmotivated, uneducated type that I desperately need to get away from. Sure Accounting is full of long hours, hard work, and people that I probably won't be a fan of but the opportunity in that field is VAST! <pythagoreanmetronome>: I have never heard anyone describe accounting as an exciting career path. You think retail is stagnant but accounting... Whoa. I know a guy who managed a shoe store for a national chain, then ended up at corporate then switched to another company became a VP and then started his own company and now owns 150 stores himself. Life is what you make of it. Sitting behind a desk all day looking a spreadsheets has its own pitfalls. Like health problems. Mind crushing boredom. Watching other people get promoted for nothing. It is highly unlikely in accounting anyone is going to say \"wow you did such an awesome job with those expense reports\" so if you felt stagnant in whatever job you had before you are likely going to battle those same feelings again. Not very many people in corporate jobs come away from it thinking the time spent and the work were all that interesting.", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 0.5}

Talk to your boss in person, don't bring up how much money someone else is making, and don't threaten to leave the company unless you have another job offer. If that doesn't work then find a job somewhere else where you make more money. Take that offer to your boss, be willing to leave, but ask if they will counter-offer to keep you there. Also, I suggest you take advantage of educational opportunities before you ask for a raise. Don't bring up things you could do, it just makes you look worse for not having done them. Get your forklift and HACCP certification, and further your outside education before you ask for the raise.<gmxpoppy>: I see what you're saying but this employee does about half the work as me and I'm her supervisor. How can I ignore my knowledge that she makes the same $? Especially because I didn't bring it up last time I asked for a raise and thought the problem was solved, but it came back again? How can I stop it from happening again without mentioning my knowledge of it?<Botboy141>: &gt; this employee does about half the work as me and I'm her supervisor. If you are her supervisor and her work is sub-par, that's what needs to be brought up for discussion, not her wage in comparison to yours. All your boss/CEO is looking at, is how many hours you work, versus how many hours others work, and maybe a slight adjustment if what you do in those hours holds more responsibility than the tasks someone else does in the same amount of hours. Life is not fair and your salary in relation to anyone elses is largely irrelevant unless you can get an offer for that amount of money. <Example>: Several years back, I was hired into a production role (sales) with a company. I accepted a final offer of $50,000 salary with full commission on top. Later I found out that another individual I work with, who had 14 years of experience more than me (I had none), was offered the same position 6 months before me for half the salary base and the same commission structure. He wound up 'training me' to some extent and I had since far surpassed what he was earning (commission numbers are transparent within the company). I'm no longer with this company but it was a valuable experience to me that everyone is worth something different to their employer. Rule of thumb, different people get paid differently based on how they are hired, how they interview, how they present themselves, how well they negotiate. Never discuss your compensation with anyone, especially co-workers. And to re-emphasize what /u/IAmDanimal said: &gt; Generally speaking, your boss doesn't really care that you think your wage is 'unfair', their goal is to get you to do the work and be happy for the lowest wage possible.<gmxpoppy>: Okay so maybe I should really be asking how to convince my boss that I DESERVE a raise, leaving everything else out of it. And what should I say/do if she denies me? <Botboy141>: Have a conversation, face to face to start. I've always liked using a line to book a time something like \"I'd like to set up a time to meet with you for ~30 minutes or so to discuss my long term goals and contributions here @ xyz company\". Explain what you do for the company, how that translates into money into his pocket and how you deserve a piece of that and that you are underpaid based on average compensation for your position in your geographical area (do the research obviously). Get offers from other companies if necessary so you can let him know that you have a few other offers and are having troubles turning them down if he can't be more competitive. Also, I don't think you mentioned it in your OP, how long have you been working there, how many promotions have you received, what was your starting wage, what is your wage now? <Edit>: &gt; We just got a great healthcare package (something I haven't had in years) Also, depending on what the company had before this, and what all this entails, this could be considered a huge pay increase by your employer and used as a strategic tactic to employ, retain and hire higher quality personnel via the benefits package.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 6.6666666667}

Fake address and phone number on the itinerary. I reverse searched the hotel images and they were taken off random concept room designing sites. I wasted 2 hours on the phone with Expedia and they hung up on me twice. I ended up booking another hotel and basically had to pay more than three times the amount I had initially budgeted for. I have filed a chargeback against Expedia via PayPal and waiting to hear back. I was reading through other people's reviews and saw stories of two people who also had to chargeback Expedia and won but were later being harassed by collections agencies. Now I want to dispute both charges and get compensated for both reservations or at the very least only pay the initial sum I had agreed upon for the first (fake) listing. Worth noting here I recently turned 18 and as such have no credit line or credit card. First reservation was prepaid via PayPal and the second one was done over phone with my debit card. I am not sure if this is the right subreddit but I saw a similar post before and thought I would also post to give it a go. Apologies if it broke any rules, I just need some guidance on this. Thanks!<tealparadise>: Expedia is terrible and will not provide any customer service beyond the minimum required by law. By law they are required to refund you. They are not required to pay for your lodging elsewhere. I've dealt with them before and believe me I am never using that site again. Now that I work on the hotel side I DEFINITELY won't. Use them to find the hotel, then call the hotel yourself and book direct. The hotel will always match Expedia's rate. If it's international, at LEAST use booking.com instead. (hotels.com travelocity tripadvisor are all just expedia in disguise, make sure you're on booking.com)<TheSpoom>: Alternatively, [reverse engineer Hotwire](http://www.betterbidding.com/) and save half on all hotel bookings ever.

Apply for both the same day, preferably on a Saturday night. I can't promise they won't report right away, but they will show up as only one hard inquiry. Before you apply for any card, run the pre-approval process first. It's a soft inquiry... Try Chase (they hate me), if anything comes up you're in luck. Discover may have offers for you, but so did I and I got declined. Barclay doesn't really have one anymore. AMEX is in-house I believe, but if you get a pre-approval you're sitting pretty.

Discover pre approved me for the IT card. The quicksilver limit was recently increased, no dice there. <kittycatsupreme>: I spoke with my parents who are credit masters.

I noticed on creditboards.com people were reporting different CRAs for the same Venture card. Is there a way to control which CRA they will pull? ---- I didn't apply yet, was doing some research and decided to wait until Saturday night like you advised. That will also give me a chance to ask my parents if they would be willing to help. I really don't like the idea of having to ask for help, but it's probably smart to see how they feel about it. I also remembered I had added a fraud alert to my CRAs because when I called to dispute an account last month the CRA suggested I add one. So I likely won't get instant approval but I don't think I've had any fraud. I was thinking about calling the CRAs to have that removed today before applying. Wasn't sure if it would be removed fast enough to matter, any thoughts? If I can't get the fraud alert cleared before Saturday night would that have any affect on your advice for applying for multiple cards at the same time?<kittycatsupreme>: Cap pulls all three boards (CRA), always. You can call the CRA and get a temporary pin to authorize a particular creditor to pull, so you'd want to reach out to the CRA first. The other option is to have the CRA unfreeze your file for a few days, while you apply. If you are worried about a fraud alert, you may want to go the pin route. In that case, you apply to CapOne, youll get a letter saying they could not verify your identity (something along those lines), and the letter will give you a number to call to provide the creditor the pin information. There's another site called whogavemecredit.com (i think) that is very similar to the first site I mentioned but tells you which board the creditor pulled. It's an old site so you'll want to sort by date. Keep in mind that some creditors pull different boards in some states, so you may want to sort by board and find the card that only pulls the boards you want pulled. CapOne pulls all three no matter what. If it were me, I'd call the CRA and find out which option they recommend to unfreeze and not draw a fraud alert. Since you have history with CapOne, and based on their approvals on that card, I'd most definitely jump through the necessary hoops before risking a denial with a new creditor. Then you could try for the venture, and if you get an instant denial, try for the unsecured platinum the same night and not waste a HP for nothing. If you find other cards that seem to be a sure bet, apply to them the same Saturday night. Hope this helps. If you are bored you should read up on the shopping cart trick. It's Comenity that will give you store cards, but they do have Visa's as well. If you get the pop up on shopping card trick for multiple stores, you might be approved for their visas.

You'll find for lower end models the price scales pretty normally with age, so you may only be paying half the cost for a car that is 5 years old, but you are also buying a car that is 5 years behind in quality/technology (fuel economy, safety standards, reliability, etc) and will start needing regular repairs in another 5 years, costing you just as much in the long run.

Hi all, I'm trying to get finances settled for my wife and I. In doing so I see one of the steps is setting up an emergency fund. I was considering something along the lines of 1 month in checking, 2 months in savings, 3 months in CDs. In looking for where to open accounts, I see the highest APY I can find for savings is 1.05% and CDs as 2.25%. However our checking account offers 3% interest if you meet certain criteria. The only one I don't meet regularly is 10+ credit card transactions totaling $100+ a month. I don't usually get this as I charge things to cashback cards - typically 1% back. My question is this, if I am keeping a $15000 balance is the equation I am looking at pretty much 1% of (credit card spending for the 10 transactions) vs .0025 * $15000 Or are the other considerations I should be looking in to? Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.<INGSOCtheGREAT>: Why not do both? Your first $100 each month on the debit card (if not 10 transactions buy things separately next time you are at the grocery store). Then switch to the credit card for the rest of the month. A bit annoying but very doable.<GigaPat>: I believe this will be the case. I'm just concerned that I don't typically have 10 transactions that equal exactly $100 in spending. It tends to be larger things. Say it would take $500 in spending to get to the 10 transactions. I wonder what the difference it would make over the course of a year. And if I should instead just use the credit card and get a different savings account so this would not be an issue.<INGSOCtheGREAT>: That is why i recommended getting the 10 transactions by buying things individually at the grocery store.

Looking for the right way to save/invest money for the future. Hey Guys, So heres my story. I'm working full time making roughly 32240 per year without commission (commission brings it to 35k) I am going to school in September and have zero debts. I've started my credit history using 2 credit cards which I never use more than 20% of and the total limit is 1800$ currently I'm contributing 5% of my income to my 401k which the company matches. I have 1.8k in savings and I am currently putting away 900$ per month into my savings account. Any suggestions on what I might be missing? I am looking to purchase a cheaper car (2-3k) in August and may finance just to build credit. Any and all help is completely appreciated. While I may not post on Reddit frequently, I do check this subreddit daily. So thanks again guys! <IAmDanimal>: First off, don't finance just to build credit. You already have 2 credit cards which you're being responsible with, so you credit score is probably fine, and financing usually costs more money, so it's not worth paying money to improve your credit score. As for what else to do - Are you still going to work full time while in school? Do you have an emergency fund? Have you read the Wiki/FAQ for what to do with your money?<xchecko>: So uhh, okay thats fine. I was just thinking about possibly putting the 2k down and financing a car thats around 5 if I didnt find anything decent (alot of flooded cars from Sandy are all over the market in my area). I will be going to school full time while going to work full time. I did that previously and I was able to maintain a 3.5 gpa while sacrificing a bit of fun. As of the moment, I do not have a sufficient emergency fund as my mom is sick with cancer and I had to pay some of the medical bills that werent covered by her insurance. As far as reading the FAQ, i have gone through it and absorbed a lot of it. Unfortunately I am a person who learns better through interaction as opposed to just reading the material.<IAmDanimal>: Ok cool, so it sounds like you're on the right track. Basically you just want to do 401k up to employer match (like you're doing already), then save up an emergency fund. After that try to max out retirement accounts, then anything after that put into a taxable investment account. I generally keep an extra month or 2 worth of expenses in my checking account, just in case anything unusual comes up (so I don't have to deal with withdrawing from my emergency fund, or if any business opportunities come along or something). Other than that, just cut down on expenses (because most of us spend a lot of money on stuff that doesn't really make us any happier). Check /r/frugal for tips and things you can do to improve on that. Lastly, I'd recommend spending around 10-12k on a decent used car. Much less than that and you start to get into hit-or-miss territory on repairs. You might get something that lasts awhile, but you also might get something that starts needing repairs right away, since you'll be looking in the 100k+ miles range at that price. My general advice for cars is to go with something around 50k miles that has good reliability and gas mileage. Corolla, Civic, and Mazda3 are good choices for small sedans, Impreza or Pontiac Vibe if you need 4WD and/or more space. Kia Forte is supposed to be pretty economical as well, and there are other decent options out there too, just do your homework before you buy something.<xchecko>: Okay that's all do-able. As far as a \"taxable investment account\" do you mean IRA? And the emergency fund is being built up first. Thankfully I have relatively low costs monthly, just unexpected costs keep weighing me down. (Which for family I'll never be upset or ungrateful about) I'm thinking about a corolla or a civic for a car. But yes I agree with the 10k price point. Might just take some more time. Thank you for being super helpful. I selected NT 2055 as my 401k but was thinking S&amp;P 500 due to a higher return rate as of late... Good idea?<IAmDanimal>: An IRA is still a retirement account. By taxable account, I mean non-retirement accounts. Don't base your investment choices based on recent returns, that's a formula for disaster. The 2055 plan might be better long-term, but a more aggressive approach might be better for now. S&amp;P500 only invests in large-cap US companies, which misses out on a lot of the world. Each 401k plan has their own specific funds you can choose from, so I don't know what your other options are to give you a better recommendation.<xchecko>: Tomorrow morning I can post a full list of my options. If I recall there was 32 different ones. If you could take some time tomorrow to look at them briefly itd be appreciated. Thank you man", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 2.7142857143}

Technically you can write them off on your taxes, but it will save you a lot of hassle if it never appears as part of your pay in the first place.<Invest_I_Gator>: I'm tracking what I need to be reimbursed, and when I am paid back, it's clearly stated as reimbursement.<spring_chicken>: If they do their accounting properly, they will still need to 1099 you for the pay you receive + the reimbursements. It will be up to you to write off the items that you were reimbursed for (usually as Cost of Goods Sold), so keep a good record of everything. Also, you may need to be filing quarterly estimated tax returns if you anticipate owing more than $1000 April 15. There are penalties for not making deposits.

I have some options to make my life easier - which should I take? I'm 28 years old. I have about $40,000 in student loans. $10,000 is at 4.5% and 30,000 is at 6.2%. I have NO retirement savings. None. Starting in September I have a 12 month overseas teaching contract for $30,000 (tax free there and in US). I will also be living rent free. I will FINALLY have some money coming in! I plan on tutoring as well which will allow me to save a good portion of my salary. So from reading and talking with others, having this much debt at these interest rates makes diverting money from my future paychecks into a retirement fund a bad idea, right? I would need a guaranteed return of more than 6.2%. However, I do want to get some money into a retirement fund now, rather than after the 2 to 4 years it's going to take me to pay off these loans. First idea: I have the good fortune of having parents that could float me maybe...$5,000 to invest towards retirement this year. I would pay them off after I knocked out my student debt. Second idea floated by father: They could take out a home equity loan, pay off the loans, and then I would pay them back at a much lower interest rate. Say the loan was then 4% or less, would it then be acceptable to invest while paying off the debt? As of now we're just bouncing ideas around. Of course there's always the option of just doing this on my own like a fully independent adult, but I suppose when you have people in your life that can and want to help, why not weigh all of the options? After all, I don't want to be eating cat food if I make it to a ripe old age. What other advice, ideas, strategies can you offer me?<Galen00>: There are lots of people on here that tell others to invest if their current loans have low enough interest rates while ignoring all the risks. But in this case you don't have that risky option since your loans have higher interest. Save and pay off your student loans. The sooner you pay them, the sooner you can start to put money into 401ks or save for a house. You have good parents, but don't do a loan like that. You basically have a plan to pay off your 30k loan in a year, focus on that.<thenthecatsays>: If I can live off of this hypothetical tutoring money then I think I would end up with somewhere around 25K of the original salary. I am skeptical if I will be able to make the extra $1000 bucks a month that I would need for living expenses and monthly loans and predict I will have to use some of my 30K salary. That being said, I need to put money away each month for an emergency fund as well. I have some money in the bank right now, but it's by no means 3-6 months worth of living expenses. So the biggest concern is well, maybe I can pay this debt off in two years time, but maybe I can't do it. If I have to wait two or more years then that's two or more years without any money growing in a retirement fund.<Galen00>: Who cares about money in a retirement fund. You won't be able to put anything significant in it. Get rid of your loans first. Student loans will ruin you and the interest negates anything you try to save for retirement. If you want to do some investment scheme, you will find more than enough people on here that supports that approach. But the simplest and best approach is get rid of your loans as fast as possible. It just doesn't make sense to have your parents get a loan that saves 2% so you can turn around and risk your money on the stock market to try to earn more than that. Just attack the loan itself. At best if you are risky, you can get some investment account and try to get 5-6% with your savings while waiting the 2 years to save up the money to pay the loans. But if the market collapses, you will lose it all and have to wait years for the stocks to rebound.<thenthecatsays>: Yeah I can't say I was too keen on my father's idea regarding a home equity loan. The primary goal is to just get rid of the loans, no questions. I suppose you're right. Even if I took $5,000 from my folks to get into an index fund, $5,000 is such a small amount it wouldn't really gain that much over those 2-4 years it takes me to pay off the loans. Perhaps the best solution is to build a time machine and begin planning for retirement a bit sooner.<Galen00>: Paying off these loans is part of retirement. Pay them off and then redirect your money to retirement or savings for something else like a down payment on a house.", "num_messages": 6, "avg_score": 1.0}

Not qualified for SSDI disability because of internships. Now I don't know how to afford to stay alive. I graduated college in 2011. A month later I was bit by a tick and got Lyme. The last four years have been filled with hospital stays, heart problems, and numerous other health setbacks that have left me unable to work. Before I graduated, I worked 3.5 years through college at unpaid internships, FULL-TIME while gong to school. I even worked 35 hours a week during my last two years of high school. I was student council president, a hard worker, and a 3.5 GPA student. Since my internships were unpaid, I didn't add up enough work history to qualify for SSDI disability. I only qualify for SSI. I've been waiting 2.5 years now for SSI, and am still waiting. The maximum amount I can get for SSI is around $700/month, that is if I get approved. I currently get $196 on EBT for food. I have aged out of my mother's health insurance through her employer and now must get my own plan. I have no vehicle. I have $20,000 student loan debt and almost that much in hospital/medical bills. I'm currently living with my 82 year old grandmother. I'm officially out of money. I have two family members willing to help, but simply cannot afford it. I'm told, through my disability lawyer, that it may be another six months for I get a hearing. Before I got sick, I was set to move to the city, had a job lined up, and a savings account. Now I can't afford my medication. I can't afford insurance, and since I don't have a job, getting insurance aid has proved impossible so far. I've done every possible easy babysitting job that my body allows me to do and it doesn't add up. I am someone who desperately wants to work. I make an attempt everyday to get back to where I once was. How am I suppose to get my feet back on the ground and rebuild my life? How does one live on SSI only? I'm not being dramatic, I simply don't know how I can afford to live. I don't know where to go when the hope runs out. <EDIT>: I want to sincerely thank those who you have offered advice and well wishes. It has genuinely helped. This is NOT a debate on Lyme Disease and whether it exists or not. I'm smart enough to know when a second opinion is needed and when that second opinion may be out of the realm of logic. I have been to hell and back, and don't need someone telling me my illness is not real. I cannot think of a more insulting thing to say to someone who wants nothing more than to feel well and to WORK. Judge me on anything you want, but do not judge me on my willingness to work. Until I got sick, I worked every day since turning 17, never had anything handed to me, and graduated college in four years while working UNPAID full time. I even worked for a year after being diagnosed until I collapsed and nearly died on more than one occasion. Open your mind and don't make assumptions. Again, thank you to each person who took time to say something nice and share your knowledge. I appreciate it so very much. Lastly, demand two weeks of Doxycycline the moment you find a tick has bitten you. <DontBuy123>: instead of banking on SSI welfare, You might want to come up with a plan B. I would not be counting on the government to bail you out. <jazzbonk>: This is why I started this post. I've never been one to count on the government. I want to work and am severely limited and out of ideas. <DontBuy123>: what is your degree in? How can you afford internet access but not your medicine?<jazzbonk>: Film/theatre and music. Well, I have to depend on my 82 year old grandmother to pay for the Internet, which trust me doesn't do a lot for the self esteem. But it turns out that the Internet is about the only way to find a job, especially a job you can do online from home. <DontBuy123>: Film/theatre = start a youtube channel.

It'll make sense in a second hopefully. Dec 31, 2014 was my last paycheck for 2014 and I had $1500 deducted from my check to hit my maximum $17.5k for TY2014. My W2 says I contributed the $17.5k number since it was the total of all of my contributions for paychecks in 2014. My 401k balance on Dec 31, 2014 only had $16k in contributions. The additional $1500 wasn't deposited until Jan 8, 2015. Fast forward to this weekend, I look at my 401k account, it shows I've already contributed $18.5k YTD since the $1500 wasn't moved over to Fidelity until this year. My most recent paycheck says $17k YTD. The plan administrator (aka my payroll dept) is supposed to stop contributions once I reach my limit. So my question is - are the limits on contributions based on the date it was taken out of the check, or based on the date the money shows up in the account? My employer doesn't do the cash transfer to our 401k provider until a few days after the pay period. <DeluxeXL>: Your contribution date is the date that you defer your compensation, i.e. when you received your paycheck or direct deposit. Your employer has a few days to actually deposit the deferred amount into your plan. You can call Fidelity using the phone number on your statement and ask for clarification. <IHateHangovers>: I've done that too, I've had split answers from 6 different people<DeluxeXL>: Since Fidelity didn't stop the money from going in, I'd say your company's record is more correct.

The first tab is just a place to easily view information regarding the apartment, and your own 'progress' as far as making calls/visits. Pros/Cons is all personal opinion, we just put whatever we immediately noticed and loved/hated. Columns for distance (in time and miles) from the apartment to each of our jobs. Then the last column for a link to the apartment online. The second tab I super cleaned up, and you'll likely have to expand it to include more columns. The basis behind it is: the thing you're rating, how high/low you'd rate it, and how important it actually is. For example, the grounds might be really nice (3) but the grounds really don't matter that much to you (4). Or the kitchen appliances are shit (-3) and that's something that's super important to you (10). It then gives each apartment a total score, and you can more easily quantify non-tangible qualities of the apartment. I left in 2 example rows in case you need an example to follow.

You'll need to save a version of it to your own Google Drive in order to edit the spreadsheet. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <ETA>: I wanted to clear up a few questions/comments, and add some useful information some people have contributed. * I probably should have included this from the get-go, but didn't think of it. We live in a suburb in the midwest (if you didn't figure as much based on the apartment prices!). A lot of my experience doesn't apply to more densely populated areas. If you're somewhere like New York or San Francisco it sounds like you've got to show up when the current tenants are moving out, with a whole years salary cash in hand, prepared to fight to the death against any one else who shows up! Do as much research into places you're looking to move as you can. * There's a LOT more to choosing a place to live than *just* the costs. In many (if not most) cases, a higher price is worth the non-tangibles you get. My larger point was to do the math, because it might be surprising. We would have chosen the higher priced apartment regardless, because it was the better choice for us. But it was a nice surprise to find the costs were much closer than they seemed. * Our estimated utility costs were a combination of A) the estimate the apartments gave us, B) estimates directly from the utility companies, and C) an average of our utilities in our current, similarly sized apartment. It's definitely a valid concern, and something to be aware of. The previous tenant most likely has/had different lifestyle requirements than you and used under/over what you'll use. Get as many estimates as you can; /u/bridgehater1 suggested not only asking the average utility cost, but the highest and lowest cost. * A lot of people suggested [padmapper](http://www.padmapper.com/) as a good search tool for finding apartments. /u/qwilo also posted several links to [rental search websites, as well as rating/review websites](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2zl03l/adventures_in_apartment_hunting_or_sometimes_the/cpk6fw2). /u/Smokey_Jah also posted a really informative article called [The True Cost of Commuting](http://lifehacker.com/5855550/the-true-cost-of-commuting-you-could-buy-a-house-priced-15900-more-for-each-mile-you-move-closer-to-work) that I think is incredibly relevant to choosing where to live. Definitely worth a read for anyone house/apartment hunting! I'll be cleaning up my spreadsheet and questions document this evening, and can absolutely share it, for those of you who asked. I may have to share it in a new post. But for anyone who asked, I'll make sure to shoot you a message so you know it's up! Lots of awesome advice throughout the whole thread. Thanks to everyone who's contributing!! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So my girlfriend and I have been apartment hunting for the last few months and have learned a LOT. I thought some of our mis-steps and new knowledge may be useful to others. I'll spoil the ending, the more \"expensive\" apartment ends up costing less money all around once we included every factor we could think of. **Choosing Apartments** The first step, and arguably the most difficult. We started out on [rent.com](http://rent.com). Filtered for not only our price range (under $800/month total), but also our \"must haves\" (washer and drying in unit, and a balcony). We then expanded out to other apartment finding websites. Then even went as far as going into Google Maps and just typing in \"apartment.\" The Google Maps step was difficult, since all of the information we wanted to find wasn't as organized as it is on a dedicated apartment finding website. But it more than doubled our options. **Important Note:** Include apartments that are slightly above your price range. If your max cost for *the apartment only*, not including utilities is $800, go ahead and grab a few that are around $825-850. You'll see why toward the end. **Narrowing Down the Search** I'm a spreadsheet junkie, I can't deny that. I put together a master spreadsheet of every apartment we found that met our requirements. Rows for each apartment. Columns for information like price, location, distance to your most frequently visited places (work, mom&amp;dad's house, nearest grocery store, a friend that you visit regularly, etc.), 'extras' (pool, balcony, private entrance, pets allowed, etc.), as well as 'cons' (near a railroad track, was our biggest con). We then assigned a number value to each thing, 1-3. Three being \"yes, this is super awesome and we want it,\" two being \"this is ok, but not enough to have a major opinion on,\" one being \"meh.\" We also assigned negative points for the negative things (-3 for being close to a railroad track, for example). I added up points for all of the apartments, and that's how we sorted out where to start. It's also where we completely cut out places. *This was all done before we even stepped foot onto a property*. **Visiting Apartments** We then put together a big sheet of questions to ask at each apartment. Typed up and printed. It included the name of the apartment, and the person we met with. This ended up being invaluable because, as those of you who have gone looking at places know, when you look at several places in one day it all starts to blur together. This gave us the opportunity to sit down at the end of the day and have our information organized (and add it to our spreadsheet!). Some of the questions we included were: what utilities are we responsible for? What's the average cost of those utilities? What is your rent payment policy and grace period? What are the options for paying rent? (check, money order, payment portal online, etc.) How is maintenance handled? Are they on-site? What's the turn around on maintenance requests? Is there separate emergency maintenance? (no one wants their only toilet out of order and have to wait for it to be fixed!) What are the most common complaints you get from residents? What is the turn over rate here? (this is a big one, if residents are staying for a long time, that's awesome!) Will we have the opportunity to see **our** unit before we sign the lease? Can we take a copy of the lease with us today to look over? What's the application process like? What do you require as part of our application? How much is the application fee? Does it get refunded if we're denied? How long will it take from handing you the application to getting an answer? We also (naively) inquired about the demographics, primarily trying to find out if there are a lot of younger people and/or kids, since they tend to be more noisy. As we were told by one of our favorite office managers: Under law, apartment complexes are not legally allowed to answer this question. Any apartment that willingly tells you anything beyond, \"We accept any and everyone who meets our qualifications, and our qualifications are the same for everyone\" is breaking the law, and maybe not the greatest place to choose. Check everything. Windows, doors, lights, water. Touch things. Ask questions. Don't be shy. This is the place you're going to be living. Make note of what you find. Point out questionable things; there may be a good explanation (i.e.-this carpet looks crappy, what's the deal? answer: we replace the carpet after every move out, so don't worry about it). TAKE NOTES, for real, it's important. Again, you will not remember which place had which issues, and you'll be stressed out about it later. **Picking Where to Apply and Applying** Because most places require an application fee, it's not really an option to apply everywhere. So you have to narrow it down. We narrowed it down to 2 places. This step doesn't have much wiggle room. You pretty much have to follow their application procedures. But a big thing you can do to help yourself is not to apply somewhere you already know you won't be approved. If they require residents to make 3X the cost of rent a month and you don't make that much, don't bother applying. If they require a 700+ credit score, and yours is too low, don't bother applying. *These are all things you should know, because you asked about the application process ahead of time!* **The Final Decision (and Some Math)** So you picked two or three places, applied and got approved at more than one. Now you have to make the final decision. You have to compare numbers, and intangibles. It's easy to look at two apartments, and make the decision based purely on how much they cost. But is the less expensive apartment really less expensive? I'm going to break down the two apartments we choose from. These expenses are all calculated as monthly expenses. So, for example, our gas usage to and from work is (X*2)*30 (I went with an even 30 days a month for the sake of not confusing myself with math!) | Apartment A | Apartment B ---------|----------|---------- Rent | $770 | $825 Electric/Gas | $130 | $100 Water | $25 | $0 (included) Monthly Cost of Gas to Work (*Combined*) | $38.40 | $38 Laundry Costs (*at 1 load each per week, total of 8 loads a month*) | $18/month | None; W&amp;D in unit **Total Monthly Cost** | **$981.40** | **$963.00** *Note: the electric and gas costs were estimated by each apartment complex, AND confirmed independently by the electric and gas companies* I also calculated the cost per square inch, because that's really the only way (in my opinion) you can compare two different sized, different priced places: | Apartment A | Apartment B ---------|----------|---------- Price per Square Foot (*here you can already see the more expensive apartment is a better value*) | $1.32 | $1.06 So, the price difference isn't huge. It comes out to **$18.40** (or $220.80 for a 12-month lease), which is really just the difference in cost between having or not having a washer and dryer. Originally, our cutoff point for rent alone was $800/month. But once we added up all other costs (and conveniences) we came out ahead with the more expensive rent (plus, let's be real, we're two chicks, we're going to do more than 2 loads of laundry a week!). We also factored in several other intangibles that don't have a price attached. Apartment B has a private entrance, meaning we get the added benefit of not having hallway noise, Apartment B is closer to both of our parent's houses and her best friend, Apartment B is also closer to a grocery store, gas station and several restaurants/fast food places. Plus, laundry in your own place is a billion times better than a shared laundry room!! Apartment A is also directly next the dreaded railroad I've been complaining about this entire time. **Conclusion** Factor in *all* costs when looking for a home (I've never bought a house, obviously, but I'm going to assume this holds true for home buying as well). A cheaper cost up front, with smaller expenses can add up to be more expensive than higher priced options. Those little expenses can close the gap between differently priced options real quickly. Please also remember, this is the place you'll be living. We would have chosen Apartment B even if it *had* come out slightly more expensive because of the added conveniences, and the 'gut' feelings we had walking into Apartment B. *I fully admit my math may be shaky, and there are probably a billion other factors that we didn't consider. This advice may or may not be applicable to others, but hopefully the general sentiment is helpful for some!* **tl;dr** Calculate all costs associated with any financial decision you make (housing, car, kids, pets, whatever). Small associated expenses can add up, and make the cheaper looking option equally or more expensive than the more expensive looking option. <tturedditor>: Very detailed, you really did your research. I would add one small thing. Drive by any place you are considering living at night. Completely different perspective and something a lot of people overlook. Make sure it is well lit. If you feel unsafe when it's dark there don't live there. <crossbeats>: For sure! We did actually do that before scheduling any visits. It definitely took a few places off of our list. Places that were loud, that had a lot of people driving around the parking lot in the evening, or had people hanging around outside by the cars; no good! On of the apartment managers also suggested making sure to drive through the complex to the back. She said a lot of complexes do a great job with upkeep on buildings that face the road, because that's what people drive by and see. But 'hidden' buildings toward the back may be less taken care of.<moysauce3>: Don't forget to park and stay in the car awhile--just listen and watch. Come and go at different times of day. <Broken_Kerning>: Who has time to do that?<cybin>: People who don't want to move again in a year.<QuestionsEverythang>: Unless you live in Portland, OR, where renewing a lease results in a higher rent at the same place rather than moving somewhere similar down the street for the same rent you've been paying all year. <EDIT>: Added state. Just thought whenever people refer to Portland, they're usually talking about the Oregon one which is the bigger and more popular of the two cities. <Lyxh>: On the bright side, allowing landlords to increase rent based on current market conditions is exactly what keeps rent lower in your city, paradoxically. It's exactly what San Francisco isn't doing, but should be doing.<willclerkforfood>: Can you ELI5 how that works?<Concision>: Landlords have to make up the rent they're not charging to people with rent controlled units by overcharging you. Something like that, I think.", "num_messages": 10, "avg_score": 256.3}

Purchasing a vehicle from a dealership can be an anxiety inducing experience. What I discovered was that the number one emotion women felt when considering buying a vehicle was ANXIETY followed by uncertainty. In this article we will review 3 tricks that dealers and car salesman use that cause this anxiety and uncertainty. I will teach you how to overcome these feelings, and become immune to the tricks. The worst thing that can happen to us as consumers is purchasing something and quickly regretting it. This is called buyer\u2019s remorse and it is a terrible feeling. Why? Well you just spent $20,000 and you are married to a monthly payment for 3-6 years. I do not want this happen to you! The following tips are designed to prevent you from being pushed around by the salesman and to ease your mind of worries in regards to overpaying. #1 ~ Emotional Manipulation During my car salesman days, we were taught many subliminal tactics to get customers interested in vehicles. One is emotional manipulation. The reason salesmen often insist on test driving is to get you to create a sense of ownership in your mind. \u201cMa\u2019am take a seat, adjust the mirrors, now adjust the seat until you are comfortable . Go ahead and turn on your favorite radio station and flip back the sunroof.\u201d Is your heart beating faster and you excitement increasing? You are unknowingly getting excited and your mind is taking mental ownership of this nice new vehicle. That awesome new car smell isn\u2019t helping either is it? That feeling of euphoria is a very human response. They are counting on you to feel this way. What happens next is quite primitive. As our excitement builds, the emotional part of our brains begins to take over. When this happens, we are much more likely to make a choice based on emotions. Have you ever heard of dogs that go crazy and get scared during lightning and thunder storms? I had an adorable shizu dog that would run miles away when thunder rumbled the house. RIP Bootsy. During these storms the logical part of his brain would turn off and the emotional part would take over. In this case fear dictated my dog\u2019s behaviors. Much like my old boy Bootsy (my mom named him btw), this happens to us when we take mental ownership of a new car. The budget we set and the price we wanted are now more likely to be negotiable. **How to overcome trick #1 \u201cEmotional Manipulation\u201d** Be mindful of your emotions. Simply being aware of this tactic beforehand and how our mind/bodies will respond is a half of the battle in not making a poor emotional based decision. I always recommend that we sleep on it. My rule of thumb is to never make a large purchase the same day. This isn\u2019t the same as picking up a Snickers while in the checkout line. This is a 5 figure purchase that we will be married to for the next 3-6 years. Be smart, go home, sleep, and revisit it the next day when your mind has had a chance to tend to other matters. #2 ~ Pushing you towards Payments After the test drive we will be directed to go inside, sit down, fill out our contact information, and discuss the price. Car salesmen are taught to negotiate the payment with us instead of the price of the vehicle. This has two benefits for them. 1) Making an affordable payment is relatable and gets your mind off of the actual price. We end up paying more this way. (See Ex1 at the end for a math based scenario) 2) The interest rate and the length of the loan can quickly fall into the background with this payment focused presentation. The payments method works because we are more likely to digest the affordability of a a monthly payments versus the 5 figure sticker price. Over six years, a $100 dollar increase is not that much, but by doing the math it will add on $6K to the total price - wow, that's mind-blowing! See below how Customer 1 saved $4,200 by focusing on a $70 lower payment. This is worth repeating...A $70 monthly difference saved $4,200!!! **How to overcome #2 \u201cPushing you towards payments\u201d** Tell the salesman up front \u201cI am not interested in going over payments right now, let\u2019s stick to the price of the car out the door.\u201d You must be proactive here. A skilled salesman may even give you a rebuttal of \u201cwell ma\u2019am, I just want to make sure you get something that is affordable and fits your budget\u201d. Just smile at your new adversary and politely say \u201cWhile I appreciate your concern, I have all of that figured out, please just get me the out the door price\u201d. (Make eye contact and smile for added value and enjoyment). They will get the picture. You want the individual price of the car and that is what you want to negotiate. You have now become a formidable opponent. You have now indirectly saved yourself hundreds if not thousands of dollars by directing the negotiations down this road. (See Ex1 at the bottom for a math based scenario on why this works) Also, the out the door price is the price of the car plus all of the fees that the dealer adds on. Better to know sooner than later what fluff fees the dealers will add. #3 ~ The Finance Office After a price has been agreed upon, we are sent into the finance office. Here you meet the Finance Manager. This person finishes your paperwork, gets you financed (or takes your check), and offers you products to protect your new vehicle. This is where even the toughest buyers lose. Why? They lose because their guard is down. When we agree upon a price, we get a handshake and a congratulations. Usually the sales manager gets in on this as well. You give out a big sigh of relief. In my sales days, I will never forget this one customer who was an excellent negotiator. He knew what he was doing and worked us down to a super low profit. He clearly was prepared and this resulted in the dealership making around $100 on the car (Nice job!). What happened next really opened my eyes. He ended up paying $4500 on the warranty and GAP products as well as accepting an interest rate 2% higher than he should have. (explanation of these products below in Example 3) All of the money he had just spent his energy and time saving was washed away in the finance office. Customers let their guard down when a price has been reached with the salesman. Don\u2019t let this happen to you. Being aware of yourself and the situation is half the battle. I want you to know the background of the Finance Managers and how they get that job. It\u2019s not by going to business school and majoring in Finance. They get there because at some point they were the top car salesman in the dealership selling 20+ cars a month. That is part of the car sales business ladder. It takes a different set of skills since they are selling an intangible product. You can\u2019t put your hands on a warranty or an interest rate. Therefore it takes a higher degree of sales skills to be successful here. They are the best at what they do and that is why they get paid the big bucks. The first move when we enter the finance office is to make us feel comfortable. Let\u2019s nott let his smile and firm handshake fool us. He has one clear goal. Convince us to buy what he has. He doesn\u2019t make as much money otherwise. He will once again show us the NEW payments if we were to purchase products A, B, or C. They make money in 2 ways. The first is by increasing the interest rate we are charged. They borrow your loan money from Bank A for 3% and charge you 4%. The dealership gets a part of that and the Finance Manager gets around $500 per % point he charges us. See Ex 2 to see how a 1% increase can cost you well over $500. The second way they make money is by selling us the company warranty or gap products which can vary drastically. **How to overcome #3 \u201cThe Finance Office\u201d** As before, we want to ask for the total price of the product we are interested in. It really is a personal preference whether you want any of these or not. I personally have and never will get any of them even if they do add free oil changes. Don\u2019t let my stance deter you though because there are some amazing packages out there that add free oil changes for years. Be ready to pay a little extra than you would normally though. The convenience is worth it for some. (See example 3 below for more information on products and how to get the best deals.) Next if not already done, we want to clarify what the interest rate is. Good luck! I hope that this information will allow you to walk into a dealership with confidence. I hope this was helpful for you and will aid you in saving hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on your next purchase. www.iwillteachyoutosave.com ~ My site **Example1** We are purchasing a $25,000 car. Let\u2019s say we go in wanting to pay $22,000. The salesman comes out and says you can choose from a payment of $460 or $391. \u201cWhich one works better for you sir?\u201d Do you see what he did there? He changed your $3000 price reduction to a payment and asked you a question directing you to pick from HIS two options. Many people lose here. They say they like one of the payments and lose OR they say they negotiate and say they want to be at $350 a month. The salesman takes your $350 request to his sales manager, they come back at $360 (They always come back higher). Great. Car is sold. Let\u2019s do the math though. You wanted to be at $22,000. By accepting $360 you just paid $23,000 for that vehicle AND you have no idea what the interest rate is. The lesson here: Keep things simple and stick to the vehicle price first. When that is settled THEN work on payments. **Example 2** A $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 4% ~ You will pay $25,920 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments A $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 3% ~ You will pay $25,200 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments That is a difference of $720 Know your local credit union or banks rates before you finance a vehicle. **Example 3** Be familiar with the products BEFORE you go into the finance office. GAP Insurance: http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/car-gap-insurance-is-it-right-for-you.aspx Extended Warranty: http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/04/extended-warranties-for-cars-are-an-expensive-game/index.htm The $4500 example above was many years ago. Competition in the warranty market has increased and they are much less expensive nowadays. Still, do your homework and check around. Credit Unions often offer much cheaper products that do more if you finance with them. Companies like State Farm Insurance now do auto financing and will give you GAP for FREE if you finance through them! My credit union charges $349 for GAP. Dealerships charge $750 and above. I hope you can appreciate the value. <Edit>: Editing Let me know if this is helpful. I want to start a website / course on car buying. Any feedback is appreciated. <Edit2>: Holy Shit, i love Gooohohohohooold. Front page:) Thanks Reddit for confirming I'm on point with the writing and material. You have given me the confidence I need to continue my journey with this stuff. There really is a problem/opportunity with an industry that triggers so many negative emotions just at the THOUGHT of it. <Edit3>: Disclaimer: there are MANY honest salesmen and dealerships out there. This was written to be informative not to put anyone down. The problem is the decade long stigma the industry has created in our minds. I find that being polite, persistent, and educated on rates and prices has gotten me the best deals. And to all the butthurt ppl commenting that this is all bs, read the comments, these are a testament to how ppl feel about the industry. Don't hate the player <Botboy141>: Awesome write up OP. Even for experienced car buyers this will be a ton of help and reminders for the next time. Thanks for taking the time to put it together.<charlottechewie>: Hey thanks man. There is a lot more i need to put down on paper. <Botboy141>: I think this is the perfect happy medium where the first time buyer won't be overwhelmed with too much information but it still adds a decent bit for those of us that have a bit more experience. The best part that you left out is negotiating the price when you are paying cash. I always take the same line as you when dealing with them talking about monthly payments, I get them to talk total cost of the vehicle out the door. I just don't tell them at that point that I'm paying cash. First I negotiate the best price I can, then I negotiate the trade in price, then I negotiate my cash offer price and usually get another ~5% knocked off. I'm not very articulate though, just know, if you are paying cash, don't tell the salesman that until after you've negotiated on a price. Once you have, ask for a discount because you're paying in cash and won't require any financing! Edit for clarity: discounts for paying cash are supposedly only effective for used cars. FWIW, I've never bought a new car and never will. I've paid anywhere between $7,000 and $17,000 for my vehicles over the last 15 years and have also talked them down further by paying cash. Interest rate offers aren't that attractive on used cars, so I would make a pure guess, that their finance guys aren't bumping points much more on them.<quesman1>: Wait, why does telling them you have cash lower the price for you? After all, if they expect to make money on the financing end of it, then doesn't you offering cash mean you took away that window? <BlueBoxBlueSuit>: In general, businesses will give a cash discount because of the time value of money. Basically, they can invest that money and make a % return, or conversely borrow less money and pay less interest themselves. Let's say you owe me $105, and I know I can get a 5% return on the market. If you pay me $100 today and I invest that money, in a year I have $105. On the other hand, if you pay me $105 in a year, I still have $105. (So in the car dealership example this is the financing profit of $5) Therefore, I might offer you a reduced price of $102 if you pay in cash, and in a year I'd have $107.20, more than if I hadn't offered you a discount. You pay less, and I end up with more money - we're both happy. There seems to be some disagreement int he comments on whether or not car dealerships will give this discount, but that's the idea behind it.<unitedhen>: I'm not sure where this falls into the mix, but I'm a first-time buyer and just purchased a couple of weeks ago. I spent weeks online searching certified pre-owned listings and would only go to the dealers when I had a specific VIN that I found online and wanted to test-drive. The first dealership I went to was awful. The lady used obvious stall tactics after I had clearly stated that I wasn't trying to purchase today, only test-drive and discuss an out-the-door price. After the test-drive, *they would not negotiate*. They would only come down $500 on price by waiving some fee that sounded bullshit anyway. It was very awkward for me trying to ask for a lower price. The sticker price was about $29.5k and I was hoping to negotiate down to around $27k. I start off by saying $26, and was immediately met with a \"that is never going to happen\"...well ok...\"how about 27\"....nope. Then I get fed a line about how dealerships don't mark up their prices anymore because people shop online and young people don't like to negotiate. I kind of stare at her like she was alien for a few seconds...\"Um, I'm not sure about other people, but I won't be able to afford the car at the current sticker price. I am prepared to buy within the week if we can come to something reasonable, but for a 3-year old car with that many miles, the current asking price is simply too high\". Nope. As a first-time buyer, this was very discouraging when I had to walk out of the dealership because they were not willing to negotiate. The also pulled the typical \"salesman-manager\" bit where the salesman will disappear into the back room for minutes at a time while you sit there waiting. It's obvious what they are doing and only serves to make me more impatient to want to get out of there *without buying*. The second dealership was up-front and easy to work with. Had no problem coming down several grand on the price and gave me a better deal on my trade in. It wasn't the car I had originally found, but I love it and I saved almost $7k by standing my ground at the first dealership!<pitbullpride>: I had the same experience as you, right down to the speech about Internet pricing. At 2 different dealerships no less. I was beginning to wonder if negotiating isn't a thing anymore<unitedhen>: I wondered that too, but patience is key if you're not in the position where you are in desperate need of a car, which I don't think my experience would help anyone in that regard. I was trying to trade my car in, and there was nothing mechanically *wrong* with my old car, simply wanted a new one so the leverage was always in my favor. I always had the power to walk away, which is the hugest power the buyer can have. Use those legs and walk if you don't like the situation, and in the end, you will be glad you had the patience to say no, even if you like the car because is several thousand dollars worth waiting a few more weeks until the right deal falls into your lap? I actually really liked the first car I drove at the awful dealership and was even justifying in my own head spending an extra $2k because I had come in to buy this specific car, after all. But then I took a step back and realized that I was playing right into their tactics and I didn't need the car today. On the drive home I called my Dad and he just advised me to wait a day and see how I felt. The next day I found a car at a dealership in the next town over, which is where I ended up buying from and it saved me so much money by simply being patient.<audacesfortunajuvat>: Just to provide a little feedback from the sales end on your two experiences: 1) It's really important to remember that a deal has to make sense for both parties. The 'internet ruined pricing' gimmick is, like most gimmicks, partially just a tactic and partially reality. A used car is worth whatever the market says it is and you can jump on your phone in about 30 seconds to find out if what I'm charging is a \"good\" price. How will you know? See what the guy down the road is charging. If $29k is the right price, I'm not gonna sell it to you for $27k even if I bought it for $10k. Doesn't make sense when the next guy will give me the $29k. 2) in your description of the first interaction, you sound... weak (sorry, but with blood in the water that's what salespeople feed on). You're not ready to buy that day, which means this is a waste of my time, and you want a big discount but aren't bringing anything to the table. If you want to buy in a week, come back in a week and if the car is still here we can talk. Used cars come and go quickly so a week might as well be a month, or never at all. You're not a BUYER, you're a shopper, and you're gonna get a lot less credibility from the salesperson in that situation. Just throwing that out there, I know it's harsh, but on the sales side they view everyone on the lot as a lying window shopper with no money, no credit, and no intent until proven otherwise. Talking to someone who's not buying means you're getting paid $7 an hour (or whatever min wage is where you live) while $100s of commissions go see other salespeople. You \"broom\" someone like that as quickly as you can: get them off the lot so you can get on to doing your job. 3) Taking into account what I said above, you either came into the next dealership ready and able to make a deal or you found a salesperson under a lot less pressure. Coming down on a used car is pretty common (although you really try not to, because they're pure profit). The numbers and flexibility you got there are probably the same as you would have gotten at the other dealership if they'd taken you seriously. You did the right thing to stand your ground though and it paid off the second time around. You should also know that almost everyone buys at the 2nd dealership they visit., mostly because they take the lessons from the first one and have a much better experience. Which brings me to the point of this vey long, never to be seen, subcomment: the key is establishing that you're a serious buyer. You'll always get your best deal when you come in and are able to say \"I will buy this car today if you can get to X price out the door\". Don't worry about how they value your trade or how they price the car (you have to juggle these things sometimes to keep the backroom bosses happy), just know what that magic number is that would get you to pull the trigger. When you get there, you can be so direct as to say \"I'd like to buy X car today, pending a test drive and assuming we can agree on a price. Can you have someone evaluate my trade-in while we do that? Here is the registration and I have the title (or it's financed through XYZ Co and here is their phone #).\" You will INSTANTLY have their full attention.<unitedhen>: Wow, so many wrong assumptions...I wasn't weak at the first dealership, in fact I did exactly as you described. Stated over the phone before I even set foot on the lot that I was serious about purchasing the specific car and wanted to test drive it. I test drove it, liked it (I knew I would, it's why I had chosen the car to begin with) but they didn't really get to the part where we agreed on a price. So how can you agree on a price if one party is being unreasonable? Was I being unreasonable expecting them to come down $2k on the asking price? Maybe...but I didn't think so since, like you said, other dealerships had listings in that price range and I didn't feel it was a waste of my time going down there to find that out. They lost a sale over $2k, and I bought a different car. Life goes on. <audacesfortunajuvat>: &gt; \"after I had clearly stated that I wasn't trying to purchase today, only test-drive and discuss an out-the-door price\" You're not a buyer, you're a shopper. I'm not gonna give you a better price so you can take it down the road and use it to beat up the next dealership. I don't even want to waste the time on a test-drive, honestly. I will, on the off chance that I can convert you into a buyer today. &gt; \"Um, I'm not sure about other people, but I won't be able to afford the car at the current sticker price. I am prepared to buy within the week if we can come to something reasonable, but for a 3-year old car with that many miles, the current asking price is simply too high\". So what's your argument? If you can't afford it, why are you here? If you're prepared to \"buy within the week\" come back when you're ready to buy. I've heard that 1,000 times and even if it is true I don't know if the car will be here then. Alternatively, if the \"current asking price is simply too high\" then my immediate question would be \"why do you think that?\" You'd show me the cars at other dealerships, I would point out all the features on the car that I have that makes our deal better, show you our service department, talk about how we've been in business X years and, frankly, don't you think that's worth an extra $10 a month, to have that backing up your purchase? Now, I wasn't there. I can only react to the way you described it. What I outlined above is my knee-jerk salesperson response to what you wrote. If there's more to the story, I guess you had to be there. Based on what you described and the treatment you received, this is my analysis. It's not the end of the world or anything; sounds like you learned a SHITLOAD about car buying, sales, and life in general which is more than you can say for most people on their first purchase AND you converted that into a great deal on a car you love. You seemed a bit baffled by the motivations that would lead to the outcome you got at the first dealership and I was just trying to shed some light on it from the other side. You're not supposed to do what they did anyway and it looks like it cost them a sale. I really love the car business but I think it could benefit from an attitude adjustment and a lot more transparency, on both sides.<unitedhen>: &gt;You're not a buyer, you're a shopper. I'm not gonna give you a better price so you can take it down the road and use it to beat up the next dealership. I don't even want to waste the time on a test-drive, honestly. I will, on the off chance that I can convert you into a buyer today. I agree with everything you said, and it's all very insightful to hear things from the sales perspective. Although I would really like to know what is the deal with salesmen trying to sell me the car that day. Do people really impulse buy cars like that? Even when I did finally buy the car at the other dealership, I knew the moment I was done test driving that it was the car I was going to buy, but I still told them I wanted to think it over tonight and would call them first thing the next day with my decision. Didn't stop them from trying to feed me lines like \"what can I do to get you in the car today?\". My answer was: nothing. If I'm going to buy, I will make the decision tonight and will come back first thing in the morning. I get that as a salesmen you want to weed out the lookers and connect yourself with buyers as fast as possible, but maybe it's just that you guys are around car sales and large down payments day in and day out, but to someone like me who buys a new car once every 10 years, you might have to be a bit more patient with someone hasn't made their decision yet. Putting down 10 grand on a car is a lot of money...no matter if I was absolutely ready to by the car right then and there, I am the type of person who will take an extra day to think it over and make sure it's what I really want and then I'll come back and buy it the next day after I have thought everything through and had time to myself to think (and not while I'm in front of a salesmen pressuring me to buy). Maybe what I'm getting at is it just seems that care salespeople come across really impatient and desperate when they try to pressure me into pulling the trigger before I'm ready and have arrived at my decision on my own. But I do enjoy hearing it from the other perspective it's interesting to see what goes through their heads too!<audacesfortunajuvat>: Because it's such a big purchase, it's really important to know what you're able to do and establish firm limits in advance: this is my optimal, my acceptable, and my upper limit expenditure. The impatience comes from having people show up who aren't ready. Yes, it's a big purchase but presumably if you're on a car lot you're ready to make that purchase. If not, stay home and browse the internet a bit more. For car salesmen, and salesmen in general, time is literally money; if you're not selling, you're making minimum wage. If you are selling, you can make well north of $100k/year. If they wanted to make minimum wage, they'd work 40 hr weeks, indoors, doing something much less difficult.<unitedhen>: Now I'm not a salesperson, but having that attitude seems like it would lose you a lot of sales. You probably see a lot of different personality types throughout your day-to-day, but I have a feeling a lot of people are like me, because I talked with co-workers, family, friends, and people on the internet for weeks before even stepping foot on the lot. I *was* prepared...but if you really believe this: &gt;The impatience comes from having people show up who aren't ready. Yes, it's a big purchase but presumably if you're on a car lot you're ready to make that purchase. If not, stay home and browse the internet a bit more. then you would have lost my sale. People like me, who come *prepared* to buy, but not necessarily *ready*, you're going to lose out on with that attitude. Now, maybe you don't care? But I would think having a mentality of \"oh this person isn't ready to drop $10k *today*, he's not worth my time\" is terrible for a salesperson (and I'm not in sales, but I have common sense). What you're telling me is because someone isn't ready *at that moment* to buy the car, he's not worth your time? How does one test drive different types of cars? When you only look at pictures of something online, you don't really get to truly know what you're buying, unless you've already had experience with it. I'm not being fair *to myself* by buying the first car I test drive. I get that time is money, but you have to think of time as an investment then. You have to invest your *time* into people who you think are worth it. Now maybe I don't come across as a serious buyer? But I really don't see how that's possible when you call ahead and state that you are interested in buying X car and want to test drive it. *So put in a little time, and make the sale*. Let them go home and think about it. And if they take your deal down to another dealership and you lose the sale? Well maybe you need to adjust your prices...the car is a economic market with supply and demand just like anything else. Even you said yourself, that the industry could use more transparency. And also (but slightly unrelated)... &gt;If they wanted to make minimum wage, they'd work 40 hr weeks, indoors, doing something much less difficult. who says you have to work minimum wage?

I'm 25 and just starting out in my career - I have student loans, rent, car insurance, etc - the usual bills. I also have 3 younger siblings that are under the age of 18 who I feel emotionally responsible for due to my neglectful parents. They're deadbeats, neither have jobs and they live off of food stamps and free rent at my grandparents house. My dad is 52 and has smoked since he was 11. My mom is 46 and has smoked since she was 30. She's also had open heart surgery (aneurysm). They're not exactly healthy, though they are fitter than many. They offer no support to my school aged siblings and I've been covering my sisters tuition outside of her Pell grants (they don't cover summer semester) in addition to her food/clothing/etc that she doesn't pay on her own with her part time job. My other siblings are 7 and 14 and obviously have years to go before they can support themselves. I want them to be okay in the event something happens to my parents and I refuse to let them get saddled with student loans like I was (community college+pell grants+scholarships will be how they pay and I'll make up the difference if/when they get to a 4 year). What's the best way to go about this? Is there a way I can purchase a policy for under $90/month to at least cover my parents debts (they have credit card debt that will likely expire by the time they die - if that's how it works?) and give my siblings something to help them with their lives. They may not die young(ish) - would it be smarter to just dump $90 into some kind of interest bearing account and let it grow over the years? We make $89,000 in a household of 3 people but that should be going up soon, I'll allocate more if it means setting them up in the long term. I know I sound insensitive about my parents but they really did screw us out of a stable life and I'm trying my best to make it better for my siblings.

And because both of them smoke, it'll be difficult to find a life insurance policy for cheap.

What advice do you guys have for starting my savings plan and situation in general? Hi all, Been lurking on this subreddit for quite sometime, thought I'd finally post something! I just graduated last week and am set to start work this early August. I will be a teacher but I will also be attending a graduate program! Here's the rundown: What I have: - 5k in bank account - I'll be getting 1k as a kind of signing bonus to help me move in to the area and help with other expenses - Starting September, my salary after taxes should be about 33k a year (40k taxed) School costs: - 3.6k for the cost of the graduate program (this summer only), the total cost of the masters degree would be about 18k. An interesting thing about this is that if I am placed into the right school, I could get this cost waived but I am just going to assume that that won't happen. Even if I do get it waived, I still have to pay the cost of the program first before I get reimbursed! - 20k in student loans (15k in direct subsidized loans 5k in perkins, both just starting their grace periods with less than 5% interest rates on each individual loan) What I'd like to do: - I would like to save at least 25k after 3 years - I would like to pay off all my student loans after 3 or 4 years What I'm unsure about: - Having a car and all the expenses associated with it So I've done some quick estimations as to what my monthly budget would be like. After taxes, I would collect about $2700 a month. Monthly costs as follows: <Housing>: ~500 <Food>: No more than 200 <Transportation>: 200 (carpool gas, uber, public transpo, etc) <Utilities>: 150 Misc (going out, etc): 150 This would leave me with about 1500 to put towards savings, student loans, the potential costs of my graduate program, and also possibly a car. Presently, I figure that once I start working, I'll save as much as I can until the first payment of my loans needs to be done. I just wanted to ask you guys that with that 1500 leftover after living expenses, how do you guys think I should disperse that between savings, students loans, and potentially a car, as well as the costs of the graduate program? I apologize in advance if I've left anything out. I would appreciate any advice, be it general or specific! <EDIT>: formatting <tccommentate>: Cars and housing are usually the big expenses. If you can do without a car, or live in shared/roommate housing you may save a lot.<AlecL>: Thanks for the reply! Yeah, at the moment, I'm really struggling on the car issue. I personally think it'd be great to have at my own convenience for traveling back to my university and doing other small things but the expenses are a bit much. Something I should have included was that my parents actually might give me the car that we use come March when they decide to move. I'm really not banking on this but my mother insists on waiting until next March if I am to buy a car. As for housing, I'm trying to shoot for living with 2 other people.

Before I read it I was barely saving anything - I'd probably have $3k in my checking account at most, but could dip down as low as $900 some months. That's really all I had. I read the book a year ago, almost to the exactly to the day. Here is my Fidelity brokerage account (what I use mainly for savings): http://i.imgur.com/Bf3xZ2f.png I also now contribute to a 401k, Roth IRA, and keep at least $2,000 in my checking account, while also making a dent in my debt. I don't know why I've read so much negative feedback on here about it. I can understand that the whole concept might go over some readers' heads. My sister and I read the book in the same 3 month period, and even though she was just as excited about it, it didn't stop her from buying a $20,000 preowned BMW with 80k miles on it (on a $45k salary.) Whether the concept is fully grasped or not, the book has a lot of good info. If anything is was motivation. I took on some freelance jobs for extra cash. I started living within my means and stopped spending the money I didn't have on luxuries. If the book really taught me anything, it's that poor and middle class people buy luxuries on credit; rich people collect assets to pay for their luxuries. I just made an offer on my first income property. The rent 2 units will bring in will cover my mortgage, provide me $300 cash flow, and allow me to save the $600 I used to pay in rent (provided the units are filled and the tenants are actually paying.) I feel like I'm finally getting out of the so-called \"rate race.\" So why the bad reviews?<Herein>: I don't think there's any bad advice in there. It's been years since I read it, but I think the knock on it was that it was fiction presented as nonfiction, which takes some of the punch out of the lessons. Kiyosaki (sp?) seems to have made his fortune selling a fictional book about how he made his fortune. <unclonedd3>: Not necessarily bad advice, but he gives definitions for assets and liabilities that are entirely made up. <area___man>: Yes. His definitions make more sense than your accountant's. Your car is a liability. Your personal residence is a liability.<unclonedd3>: No, they don't make sense. Asset and liability are words with actual meaning and a definition for which a consensus has developed over centuries of contemplation. If you find use in analyzing your financial situation using the model that he presents, that is fine. The definition of those words is not up for debate, however.<area___man>: Slavery was an institution for most of human history. Sometimes institutions can and should change. His definition is better, and more appropriate to measuring wealth.<unclonedd3>: RK's use of those terms lends itself to characterizing your possessions and activities, but the concepts he gives do not provide any quidance for measuring anything. You mention measuring wealth, so tell me your equation for net worth in terms of assets and liabilities.<area___man>: I submit that net worth is a relatively useless measure of true wealth. I defer once again to the rich dad definition of wealth: how long could I operate without working?<unclonedd3>: I don't have a problem with that definition. A change in net worth should always have a proportionate change in the length of time you could live without working. Assets increase how long you can live without working and liabilities decrease how long you can live without working. Liabilities are so bad that you would pay someone to take them away from you and assets are so good that you would pay money to acquire them. When was the last time you thought about paying someone to take your \"liability\" of a house away from you? RK's definition of assets really only differentiates between income-producing assets and everything else. A house costs money to maintain, but that amount is much, much less than the cost of other shelter if you didn't have the house.", "num_messages": 9, "avg_score": 9.4444444444}

We were in a poor financial situation when she passed, and I would like to make sure that I am using the money effectively so I don't get into this sort of situation again. I have a plan, but very little experience, so I'd like to know whether my plan is the right one under the circumstances. <Debts>: We had about 4k in unsecured credit. I owe 17k (8%) on our car. I have student loans which recently defaulted totaling about 19k (4.25% I believe. Whatever the federal subsidized loan rate is). We also had not filed federal taxes since 2010, and I estimate we owe roughly 15-20k (this includes expected penalties and interest) in back taxes from 2011-14. I have a meeting scheduled with an accountant tomorrow to get the tax returns filed and get an exact picture of what I owe. The only other debt we have is some unpaid medical bills that have gone to collections, mostly under her name. <Income>: I earn $5,100 a month. Our 2 children will receive SSA survivors benefits for 2k a month. My plan is to use the life insurance to pay off the federal tax debt, unsecured credit card debt, and then vehicle debt, in that order. I will request rehabilitation on my student loans. Any funds left I intend to stick into savings. Is there anything wrong with this? Is there anything I'm missing? Other questions/concerns: 1) As far as medical bills for my wife, am I liable for those? They are from several years ago, but still from when we were married. 2) Is there any truth to those commercials advertising programs to reduce tax debt if you owe more than 10k? I hear them on the radio and they sound like scams, but is there any merit to them? Is that worth pursuing? 3) I am going to be taking our children and moving in with my parents in about a month. I will be staying with them for at least the summer so my mother can watch the kids while I work. When I am ready to get a place of our own again, I will be looking close to where they live since my mom has volunteered to continue to watch the kids. This means a longer commute to work (about an hour), but will be better than paying out the nose for child care. Rents in their area are about $1800-$2300 for 2-3 bedroom apartments and homes. Is this affordable for me? It's $1900 a month where we're staying now, but we were slowly drowning financially here and I don't want to do that again. On the other hand, I will be moving in to the new place without the car payment or other debt payments, which amounted to about $900/mo total. I know there is a general rule that rent should be less than 30% of income, but I don't know if that is built around gross or take-home. I pay into a pension and pay health insurance through my employer, so my take-home usually ends up being about $3,600/mo. This may go down a couple hundred if I need to adjust my tax withholdings to ensure I don't owe again. So please, let me know if my plan is sound, or if you have any advice that would help me refine it. Since I have to start over at 35, I want to make sure I do it right. <i_like_secrets>: You may need to adjust your W-4 with your employer so that taxes are withheld at the correct rate for your new filing status. As to what debt to pay, if it was solely in her name, see if they will write it off with a death certificate, etc. For joint debt, pay off the debt with the highest interest rates first. http://www.unbury.us I would not move until you've had a few months to assess the situation.

Paying for child care for my two children over the summer would run about 2k a month. I need to be closer to relatives to avoid that cost which means moving.

And if you stick around this sub long enough, you will know how hard it can be to kick out and/or recover from a friend staying with you who doesn't pay their portion of the rent.<Nuts4Nads>: Yeah that is what I'm worried about now.", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 2.6}

I ended up with either 18,000 or 30,000 (depending on if my insurance decides to grant me another 12,000) and that is with my medical bills all payed. I'm not very knowledgeable on finance or anything of the sort. I just wanted to ask advice in regards to maybe investing some of the money to try to gain more in the long run. I really just have no clue and any advice would be hugely appreciated! Thank you<ExNorth>: I'm a rider, too. What all happened during the accident and how did you make off like a bandit? To help you with your money situation: Get a bank account set up and keep the money in there. Avoid spending it on cars, motorcycles, toys, games and fast food. Doing so will quickly drain your head start on life. Get college lined up if you don't already and plan on 'investing' the money in your future. You could possibly go to a state school and come out with a bachelors degree debt free. From there you start life a good step or two ahead of other people your age. You could take $5,500 and put it in to a Roth IRA and get it back when you retire. This money, once invested, cannot be touched or taken back until many years have passed. My parents have talked to me about this because I have some money saved up. I would suggest looking in to this if you get the larger sum of money. So, in short: Put the money in the bank and don't foolishly spend it. Go to school and use it to pay for school. Getting a part time job while in school can help curb the costs of living and help extend this benefit further.<kiloecho44>: Most of this is good advice, but instead of a plain old bank account, put most of it in a shorter-term CD so that you can't withdraw it before you know what you want to invest in.", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 5.3333333333}

Is there a way to do this without applying all over again to get a second bachelor's degree? Let me clarify: I want to be educated and fulfill all the necessary courses to become a certified CPA; I just don't want to have to take any of the generals like biology 101 or English 101 or whatever.

Didn't you already take gen eds for your current degree? you apply those to a new accounting degree, take the accounting degree retirements, then take your CPA exam.<YoungAmsterdam>: So you're saying I should apply to an accounting program as an undergrad again but just transfer those credits from my old school to cover the general courses at the new school? <Edit>: Also, what are the \"accounting degree retirements\"?<coffeeshopsnob>: Do you have to go to a completely new school?
