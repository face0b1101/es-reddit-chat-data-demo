I was speaking too softly to be picked up by those microphones, and I didn\u2019t want to yell across the table.

Join us each episode as we dissect our and your favorite films, while daring to ask: could it be better? Could it be gayer?* [*Twitter*](https://twitter.com/whatthehetpod) *//* [*Facebook*](https://facebook.com/whatthehetpod/) *//* [*Tumblr*](https://whatthehetpod.tumblr.com/) We just yesterday released our [newest episode](https://whatthehet.podbean.com/e/ep-6-stick-it/), which I'm super proud of but also had some audio issues I did my best to mitigate in post but still left some noticeable artifacts. One that's much more indicative of what I would consider our standard quality level as well as a generally accessible jumping on point would be [our episode on Raiders of the Lost Ark](https://whatthehet.podbean.com/e/ep-5-raiders-of-the-lost-ark-aka-indiana-jones-disaster-bisexual/). It's also almost right on the money for what I would consider the average length of one of our episodes, which is one of my own personal anxieties regarding the show. Questions, I suppose, would be: \\-What is your impression of the content of the episode? Do we move too fast/too slow? Are we too unfocused, to the point of detraction from the listener's enjoyment? \\-How do you feel about the length of the episode? I worry about the episodes running too long (our shortest numbered release, which was our most recent ep, is 70 minutes; our longest so far was just under two hours), however all the feedback I've received through [surveying listeners](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/375R8DH) (which at this point, while anonymous, is still almost definitely coming from family and close friends) hasn't emphasized the episode length as being an issue, so maybe I'm just too hung up personally as the editor? \\-Anything else immediately jump out to you as an issue or stumbling block? Public critique is also most definitely fine!!<dirkprimbs>: I listened to your latest episode today. First thing I noticed is that your Google Play link does not work for me (nor does your show appear on Google Podcasts which is a different place than Google Play). You might want to look into that and I am not sure if that is just a geo thing (I am in Germany) or if it is a more general problem. I used pocket casts then and found your show, so your registration in itunes seem to have worked fine. **Audio** A mixed bag. Alex's audio is initially very good (even though some humming sound starts off somewhere around minute 10 or so, air conditioning?) but Niko's audio could use some work. Sounds to me like a skype connection + less then ideal mic situation + an echoey room. It did not put me off because you were fun to listen to and I understood Niko fine. Yet there is room for improvement. Things you can do (from easy to hard): * record in a different room (more textiles, more books, smaller room). It may sound weird but walk in closets tend to be natural recording booths ;-) * Look at your recording technique. Usually being closer to the mic and dialing down the gain helps to pick up a little less room sound. * What mic are you using? There are microphones that pick up less room and more voice. * Skype (or similar services) usually lowers the sound quality as well. A way around that is to record locally while doing the video chat and to send the recording to the person editing the show. * Some of light audio processing might help against some of the room sound and the hum/fan noise. Your audio software might have a gate effect you can use or you might consider using a service like auphonic. **Content/Structure** The cockroach-apocalypse in the beginning made me laugh. In general, I had plenty of moments where I laughed. You two have a great conversation and I grinned a lot. &amp;#x200B; **Your questions** &gt;What is your impression of the content of the episode? Do we move too fast/too slow? Are we too unfocused, to the point of detraction from the listener's enjoyment? You do a fine job moving through the plot. The listeners enjoyment comes from listening to your conversation, so I don't think you were too unfocused. That said - for a podcast that is more than 30 minutes I do think a bit of segmentation helps a lot that will give listeners a sense of where they are in the podcast and it makes it easer to come back to it if you need to hit pause. Maybe doing a fun game, introducing running gags (like watching out for cinema clich\u00e9s or something like that), maybe playing some music in the middle or having a \"new in gay cinema\" segment etc. &amp;#x200B; &gt;How do you feel about the length of the episode? I worry about the episodes running too long (our shortest numbered release, which was our most recent ep, is 70 minutes; our longest so far was just under two hours), however all the feedback I've received through [surveying listeners](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/375R8DH) (which at this point, while anonymous, is still almost definitely coming from family and close friends) hasn't emphasized the episode length as being an issue, so maybe I'm just too hung up personally as the editor? There are two schools of thought and one advice I can offer. \\#1: You'll find plenty of articles and opinions out there that suggest 30 minutes as the ideal length because that supposedly is the average length of commuting and that is the time where the most listening happens. Some say you could do 60 minutes for the same reason because that allows you to listen to half on your way to work and the other half on your way back... \\#2: The second line of thinking is that the show could be as long as you want as long as the content warrants it. There are successful podcasts with up to 9hours length(!) and some as short as 30 seconds. In general the beauty of podcasting is that you're free to find your own balance. \\#my take: 1-2 hours are fine but try to find a natural way to add structure to it. Your listeners can pause and resume, so I would not restrict myself if I were you. The only thing that I would add: try to be consistent. If normally your show is about 1.5hrs people will be surprised if you switch to a 15 minute format or put in 3 hours. It may be fine once in a while but in general the audience comes to expect a certain type of content and you risk loosing listeners if you throw them off balance too often. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Anything else immediately jump out to you as an issue or stumbling block? Nothing severe. I would focus on getting the audio more even first and then introduce some gentle structural elements (segments, a sound board, running gags...) but in general I found your show engaging, entertaining and definitely good use of my time! &amp;#x200B; Hope this feedback was useful! //D<thewidewindow>: Wow! Thank you for such detailed feedback! It's interesting that you were unable to find the show through the means you mentioned, the Google Play link works for me and I actually am subscribed to the show myself through Google Podcasts so I know that one works as well. It being a geography thing makes sense (I'm in the US), I'm not sure how I'd go about fixing that but thanks a lot for letting me know! I'll definitely look into it. The audio issues you mentioned were exactly what I was referring to; the buzz/hum on my (Alex's) part came from my roommate turning the air conditioning back on while I was recording (the room I record in is more or less a walk-in supply closet in my basement, which works great but unfortunately has a large pipe leading in through the ceiling which means water/air running is very audible). I may just have to find a new location to record in, which is unfortunate because otherwise it makes for a perfect studio. As for Niko, I think they just... forgot to talk into the mic for a while? They also live in a very small one room apartment, with a dog, so getting clean audio from them is always a little bit of a challenge but usually not too bad. We actually do use Skype for our sessions and record remotely, then I combine the audio tracks and do all the relevant editing and clean up in Audacity. Thanks again! If you'd like to link your show, I'd be happy to check it out as well :)<dirkprimbs>: Thank you! The name of the show is 2debate.

Do you think we succeed in that? If not, what where do we fall short? * What do you think about the general format? Any thoughts what we could improve in terms of structure/content? * Can you think about a fun motion to debate? E.g. would something like \"Marvel is better than DC\" be a motion you'd find interesting? * Neither Sebastian nor I are native speakers. Is that a problem in any way? How hard are our accents on your ears? //D<thewidewindow>: I listened to the most recent episode of your show! First off, I like your debate format a lot; it's a style of show I'm surprised I haven't seen more of. I would say, having listened to just the one episode and scrolled through the topics of all your previously released debates, I do appreciate that you seem to do a good job of finding topics relevant to current events, while also finding ways to approach the topic from a different angle than simply talking about the already sensationalized aspects of the event itself. I would have been turned off had the debate topic been \"Should Brett Kavanaugh have been confirmed to the Supreme Court?\" or \"Should victims of sexual assault be required to provide greater proof when making public accusations?\", but I found the approach you chose instead, discussing an aspect of why the Supreme Court itself is the way it is, interesting and informative. This strikes me as a good way of not only staying relevant to current events, but also providing greater education than simply rehashing what people are already seeing every day in the news (I myself am a native United States citizen, and found myself learning a lot about the composition of the Supreme Court from your debate... and it's one of the branches of my own country's government!) As for the structure of your show, I have no complaints. You moved at a good pace through your introductions, establishing the parameters of the debate, and then each of your arguments, rebuttals, and closing statements. I also thought your \"third host\" in the announcer style introductions to each segment of the debate was a good touch and sort of funny, almost like the debate was a wrestling match. I will say I was surprised when the closing music started playing, you each said your goodbyes, it was silent for a period of time... and then you suddenly came back and started talking about the topic again for another five or six minutes while the music continued to play in the background. Not that I minded! The two of you have good chemistry and I enjoyed listening to your conversation, and it was also sort of funny, like the two of you had settled the debate and then just couldn't help but pick it up again and continue to argue for several more minutes. I was just surprised when I thought the episode was over, and then... it wasn't. I think your current approach of finding your debate topics in current events is a smart way to stay both relevant and informative. In a way, this makes your show not only about arguments people are having online, but also in itself a source of current information. Not the news itself, but more like the editorial section of the newspaper. I do think finding time for lighter debates could be a smart move and a good way to keep your audience entertained/balance out the heaver debate topics you often seem to choose; I think a broad topic like \"Marvel or DC?\" might be a little less engaging, not to mention harder to build strong arguments around, but something in that style could still be fun, like \"Were the Jedi from Star Wars good or corrupt?\" or \"Was Thanos right to want to kill half the universe in order to save the other half?\" (Okay, that second one might be a LITTLE heavy...) I had no problem whatsoever in understanding either one of you! Your accents were not distracting to me in any way; in fact, I actually found you both very charming! As I said, you two have great chemistry and your conversation flowed very smoothly and naturally. I was entertained through the whole episode. I am curious: as neither of you are native English speakers, and you both live outside of the US, what was it that made you want to do an English language podcast that deals largely in US-centric events? (not that you don't also talk about other countries' current events; I did see you had an episode focused on Brexit, and I'm sure there were others as well that I simply haven't listened to yet. I Just find it interesting and wanted to ask!) EDIT: Looking back at your original post, I do see now that you mentioned having done three other podcasts previously in German, with this being your first English-language show. That answers my question in part, I suppose! Although I am still curious what it was that made you want to do an English-language podcast in that case; simply to reach a different audience? Overall, I can't say I have too many complaints! Again, the episode ending and then... not ending caught me off guard, but as I said, I did not mind the extra few minutes \"as the credits rolled\", so to speak. I'm actually going to stay subscribed to you so I can catch up on some of your older episodes! All in all, great work and keep it up!<dirkprimbs>: Wow, that was an amazong piece of feedback! Thank you so much for taking the time to write this! &amp;#x200B; &gt;I will say I was surprised when the closing music started playing, you each said your goodbyes, it was silent for a period of time... and then you suddenly came back and started talking about the topic again for another five or six minutes while the music continued to play in the background. Not that I minded! The two of you have good chemistry and I enjoyed listening to your conversation, and it was also sort of funny, like the two of you had settled the debate and then just couldn't help but pick it up again and continue to argue for several more minutes. I was just surprised when I thought the episode was over, and then... it wasn't. Yes, that is something I will keep in mind. The reason for the setup is that I originally played outtakes and things I found funny from our after-debate conversations in short snippets. These were naturally part of the \"after show\" if you will. But sometimes we actually have a broader conversation and when I add that, then I see why it gets confusing to hear us saying good bye but then coming back with more content. I will definitely change that since that seem to surprise people. &amp;#x200B; &gt;I do think finding time for lighter debates could be a smart move and a good way to keep your audience entertained/balance out the heaver debate topics you often seem to choose; I think a broad topic like \"Marvel or DC?\" might be a little less engaging, not to mention harder to build strong arguments around, but something in that style could still be fun, like \"Were the Jedi from Star Wars good or corrupt?\" or \"Was Thanos right to want to kill half the universe in order to save the other half?\" (Okay, that second one might be a LITTLE heavy...) We tend to gravitate to serious motions, true. We had a debate \"Star Wars is overrated\" or \"Underground tunnels, not flying cars are the future\" but I agree, we should have one of these more often. Regarding Thanos or Marvel vs. DC - I would need to find another debating partner for these. Unfortunately Sebastian is completely ignorant about superheroes ;-) &amp;#x200B; &gt;I am curious: as neither of you are native English speakers, and you both live outside of the US, what was it that made you want to do an English language podcast that deals largely in US-centric events? (not that you don't also talk about other countries' current events; I did see you had an episode focused on Brexit, and I'm sure there were others as well that I simply haven't listened to yet. I Just find it interesting and wanted to ask!) Let me answer in two parts. First, why English: One - I have a passion for podcasts and after knowing the German scene very well I honestly wanted to see how it is to launch a podcast that addresses a global audience. Second - Sebastian is a Frenchman and we both work in a US company. Hence, when we do a podcast together it has to be English since I don't speak French very well and Sebastian's German isn't good enough either. The second part - why US centric: That is not intentional. Probably it shows a cultural bias we have. Since we work for an US company with many US colleagues I suppose your events are more present to us than many others. Besides, there are plenty of events that make the news globally or at least are relevant to all of us. We do try to have a broader balance though with topics out of science or general culture as well but we definitely can do better in that department. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Although I am still curious what it was that made you want to do an English-language podcast in that case; simply to reach a different audience? So many reasons ;-) * I was curious if it is different to address an English and global audience. * Since English is not my native tounge a podcast in that language is an amazing opportunity to improve my language skills. * English is the only language Sebastian and I share. * Debating like this is an anglosaxon thing and very common in your culture. In Germany it would be harder to establish a format like this. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Overall, I can't say I have too many complaints! Again, the episode ending and then... not ending caught me off guard, but as I said, I did not mind the extra few minutes \"as the credits rolled\", so to speak. I'm actually going to stay subscribed to you so I can catch up on some of your older episodes! All in all, great work and keep it up! Thank you so much for your kind words, it means a lot to us!

Radiotopia had a \"pitch us a new idea for a podcast\" contest. Got something like 1400 pitches. The execs at Radiotopia narrowed it down to like 50 and Ear Hustle was not on the top of their list. It almost didn't make the cut. Then they opened up the voting to listeners and supporters to pick the one best idea and they picked Ear Hustle as the best idea for a new podcast. So Ear Hustle was born. And in 25 episodes we've learned to appreciate and love not just E but so many other characters in that prison. To the point where now when E gets out, there are hundreds of people if not thousands all so excited and happy for him. If they didn't make the podcast he would be getting out and maybe nobody would congratulate him. It's just crazy how powerful podcasting can be.<endless_thread>: I was on the committee that went through those (many, many) submissions back in the day and can confirm. Radiotopia supporters were passionate and nearly unanimous in their support for the idea of Ear Hustle. Pretty cool to see<lime-link>: I once volunteered to review 10 podcasts here on Reddit. It took me 3 days to go through 10. I can't imagine going through 1400 podcasts and check them all out. That process must have been monstrous. But I've heard Julie explain this process and it was a nightmare. But then you have Gimlet's The Cut, and they magically narrowed their hundreds of entries down to 3. Without explaining how they did it at all. I was very skeptical that they actually listened to all of the pitches... <endless_thread>: Luckily it was a good-sized group going through everything so work was divided but...yeah...I think that's when it really dawned on me how big podcasts were getting.

We currently have about 1200 listeners, half of which we have gained in the past two months. I just want an honest critique from you. Listeners tell me they like it and love it, but I want to improve in every way, whilst keeping it real. Our sound has improved dramatically and sounds like an actual studio now, and I've just ordered new microphones and an interface so in January we will sound even better. We did our first live show in front of a sold out theatre last month which is how we got a lot of local press. I'm just curious to know why people like the show and why people hate the show. I'm working on improving my speech, content and timing, without coming off as pretentious or ingenuine. Pick an episode title that gets your attention and give me your honest and brutal feedback please. I'm about to invest in a set so we can do video podcasts for YouTube in January, so I'd like as much advise as possible. Thank you in advance.

Not a podcast, but Jordan Peterson's biblical lecture series is also amazing(even if you aren't religious, it's still a great, thought provoking series). &amp;#x200B; <EDIT>: Just expanding on JBP. He talks in such a way that he verbally fleshes out ideas and philosophies to the nth degree. He is basically thinking out loud but it's a great way to take a deep, deep dive into an idea or philosophy. Even if you disagree with him, I absolutely love his \"thinking out loud\" style of talking.<TerraceEarful>: Jordan Peterson is lying, reactionary trash. [deleted]: Have you listened to the biblical series or are you just triggered that I suggested a right leaning commenter? <TerraceEarful>: We have someone here who is asking for self-help recommendations. You suggest someone whose contributions to the field amount to \"clean your room and blame feminists for your problems\". I've heard enough of Peterson's self-serving pseudo-deep nonsense to know that I would not be interested in his hot takes on the bible. [deleted]: So basically what you're saying is that you haven't heard his biblical series at all and you're assuming it's just like his debates and interviews (it's not at all). OP literally said he is asking for a podcast that can help him explore different opinions and ideas and that will be a kick in the pants to motivate him in life. I can definitely say that JBP has been that for me. So yeah you answered my question. You haven't heard what I'm actually suggesting, you're just triggered because it's someone who's opinion you disagree with or who's philosophies you don't like. That's entirely your right but don't force bitterness on everybody else. <OP>: It's free. Listen to some of his biblical series and see if it grabs your fancy. It might not, but that's ok. It's not for everyone. At worst you've lost a few hours of your life and developed a first hand opinion of somebody who's gaining popularity these days anyway. I'm not telling you that you have to enjoy it. It's just a suggestion for something you *might* enjoy. <EDIT>: Oh and btw if you think his message is \"blame feminists for your problems\" then you have entirely misunderstood his positions. He's extremely critical of the \"incel\" pity party and constantly says that there is nobody to blame but yourself and that you should pull yourself up from your boot straps. Also, you know that the \"clean your room\" is an allegory for \"take responsibility for yourself\" but you deliberately mischaracterised it to make him seem like a cheesy \"life hacks\" guy.<TerraceEarful>: I've heard him lie about pretty much everything else he has opened his mouth about, but I'm supposed to believe there is value in his biblical analysis. Ok then. Beyond the lies and the politics, here is something that bothers me about Peterson as a self-help guru: The man is clearly deeply miserable and filled with barely contained anger. A pint of cider apparently sends him into a 25-day cycle of sleeplessness and feelings of impending doom. Is this really a man you want to be taking advice from? [deleted]: Please give examples of where he's lied consistently. I've a feeling you've seen mostly snippets and \"gotchas\" instead of watching any of his videos at length. As for sensitivity to alcohol, I don't see how that's relevant to the quality of his ideas. Do you even ad-hominem bro?<TerraceEarful>: This is always the same response from Peterson fans. 'Have you watched all his videos bro? Only then will the depths of his wisdom reveal itself to you.\" I've watched plenty of his videos, I've read his 12 Rules for Life cover to cover. There is nothing there but superficial self-help on top of a layer of reactionary politics. You want lies? How about him claiming to be an evolutionary biologist? How about his misinterpretation of the transgender bill that is shared by exactly zero legal experts? How about claiming he is on an all beef diet, which every doctor and actual expert on nutrition will attest will literally kill you? How about claiming to be all about full speech and sending multiple cease and desist letters to silence those who dare criticize him? How about his repeated spreading of climate change denialism? It is worth noting, that on literally everything he comments on that is outside his actual field of expertise, the people who are actual experts disagree with him. Ask a biologist about his lobster analogy. Ask a legal scholar about his interpretation of the c-16 bill. Ask a nutritionist about his diet. Ask a philosopher about his interpretation on post-modernism. Ask a historian about his views on the history of communism and fascism. All of them will tell you he is wrong, over and over again. But of course, the easy explanation for that is the same as it is for every other kook: there is a conspiracy of \"post-modern neo-marxists\" who have taken over academia and are suppressing the real truth! [deleted]: I didn't say you have to watch all his videos. I said I suspect you've seen snippets instead of full length in-context videos. If you haven't, good for you. I can't comment on him claiming to be an evolutionary biologist other than I doubt he was trying to claim that he was qualified in it but rather that it's something he's done research in. If he was trying to claim credentials then I agree that's dishonest of him. Doesn't mean he doesn't have any other useful insight. He specifically said he was against Bill c-16 **and its surrounding legislation**. That's important. He was worried about the compelled speech and that is in fact a reality in parts of Canada and c-16 is the federal backing for many of the local laws regarding speech. He didn't claim c-16 in itself was that bad. As for the all beef diet, I can say with first hand experience it's possible, as some of my family members have done it. Carnivore diets are well known and fairly popular. I'm not claiming they're healthy or worth it but you can survive on them. Him claiming it works for him isn't a lie. It's an anecdote. Unless you can prove that it didn't actually work **for him**(or they he didn't do it) then you can't call it a lie. And he didn't suggest other people should try it. He's actively said he hates it and wouldn't recommend it but that in his case it worked. As for the cease and desist letters, the only examples I can find of him sending them is in the case of libel such as people claiming he's a white supremacist and such. He is actively against white supremacy or any sort of identity politics so somebody publically misrepresenting him as one is in fact a crime. Besides, from what I can tell from what he says in other cases, he's not a free speech absolutist. He's just against competed speech. I may be mistaken though. I've seen no climate change **denial** from him. At most I've seen skepticism which I think is deserved seeing how inaccurate the models have been historically. He's discussed his opinions on possible climate change solutions so I don't think you can call him a denier in good faith. Even if he was a denier, that doesn't make him a lier. It just means he has a different interpretation/opinion of the current body of evidence. I'm not saying he's right, but that does not make him a lier. As for whether his opinions on his non-expertise are valid, that's irrelevant as you're saying that OP shouldn't even consider his thoughts on his expertise which is psychology. The biblical series is \"the psychological significance of the biblical texts\" and that's what he does. He picks apart the biblical stories and draws analogies to psychological concepts. Anything else?<TerraceEarful>: Surrounding legislation? What are you even babbling about? Please be specific. Here's an example of Peterson sending a cease-and-desist letter to a feminist for the crime of criticizing him: https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/09/24/jordan-peterson-dishes-out-what-he-sees-harsh-truths-can-he-take-them-return And no, calling someone a white supremacist is not a crime, it is merely an opinion. If one were to claim 'Peterson has called for the extermination of minorities', that would be libelous because he never said such a thing. There are also people who claim to flourish through strictly consuming air and sunlight. Peterson is free to submit himself to scientific scrutiny in order to disprove all of nutritional science currently known. Zero chance he will do so though, because he is of course lying. On climate change, this is the typical stance from weasels like him. He's skeptical of facts that are inconvenient to his ideology, never on those that support it. [deleted]: Surrounding legislation were his words not mine. I'm just quoting him and pointing out you left out a critical piece of information regarding his view point. I can't say for certain what legislation he was referring to but I know there are compelled speech laws in some localities in Canada which I suspect were what he was talking about. In that case I agree with you. I think it was uncalled for for him to sue over fair criticism. That still has nothing to do with the quality of his commentary on the Bible. My mistake. You're correct. I misunderstood libel. I seriously don't see why you are so extremely doubtful of the carnivore diet. It's a well known fad diet. If people were dying in the masses from it then I'd expect much more News about it. He doesn't have much ideology regarding climate change except that solar and wind are highly inefficient and are not yet viable (this is completely true so far). He's in support of nuclear which is the cleanest form of energy we have. He isn't skeptical that climate change is happening. He's just skeptical of some proposed solutions and of the degree to which it may be a problem.<TerraceEarful>: There are plenty of fad diets that are extremely unhealthy. This is one of them. For Peterson to be recommending this one, as a scientist, without it having undergone rigorous scientific scrutiny is highly irresponsible. He really, really should know better. [deleted]: I explicitly said in my previous comment that I don't think it's healthy. I agree it's likely very unhealthy. But he didn't endorse it. He just said it worked for him.<TerraceEarful>: Yet he promotes his daughter's $150 an hour consultations, who has zero qualifications in nutritional science and relies strictly on her subjective experience. Is that not an endorsement? [deleted]: I've never heard him explicitly endorse her other than saying it was her suggestion but if he does explicitly endorse her then I agree he shouldn't. Still has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of his commentary.<TerraceEarful>: He has absolutely promoted her on his Twitter feed, linking to her consultations for his hundreds of thousands of followers. The entire thing is merely one of many data points pointing out that Peterson isn't to be trusted. So when Peterson offers up his biblical interpretations, it seems more than reasonable to point out that he has a history of being dishonest to support his socially conservative ideological claims. Since interpretations are just that, interpretations, not provable facts, it would be difficult to assume his wouldn't be tainted by his ideology.", "num_messages": 17, "avg_score": 3.7058823529}

How would someone change some of the formula to stay within that population of listeners, but have their own identity.

It would be cool to hear real discussions between an athlete and a coach who know each other fairly well. I do not know if any of your athletes would be up for something like that, but you two talking with each other and discussing the topics about life, personal interests, etc. would be something different than what I usually hear on strength coach-ran podcasts.<johnnyjayd>: Interesting perspective, I like it! I don\u2019t believe it would be very sustainable from a regular content perspective, but it would give me an opportunity to change the tempo every few episodes. The cool part about my job. Is that I travel with the basketball team to different colleges around the country. I wish I already had this up and running bc I feel like I\u2019m missing out on opportunity every time we hit the road and I have no show to work on. <bingewarmer>: That sounds like a really fun job, I hope to do something similar one day! So when you travel with the team, do you link up with other strength and conditioning coaches? I am assuming you do but I imagine you have other duties as well.<johnnyjayd>: Most definitely have other duties, but I try to get in touch with them at least a week out to set up a brief meeting with them. Sometimes I can spend a couple hours with them, while my team is doing something where they don\u2019t need me.

Mine are currently: Stuff to Blow Your Mind - Discussion about topics from every corner of science and culture Love + Radio - People telling unusual and fascinating stories from their lives Myths and Legends - Tells myths and Legends from all around the Globe Curious to hear what your top 3 are. <Psilocybology>: 1) Philosophize This! - An educational podcast about philosophy where you don't need to be a graduate-level philosopher to understand it. In chronological order, the thinkers and ideas that forged the world we live in are broken down and explained. 2) Justice in America - Each episode covers a new criminal justice issue. We explain how it works and look at its impact on people, particularly poor people and people of color. 3) Intercepted - Discussions about the crucial issues of our time: national security, civil liberties, foreign policy, and criminal justice. (Descriptions taken from bits of their Spotify descriptions)<DTownForever>: I also really enjoy Intercepted - though I don't always agree with what they say, they always examine things from a big picture, historical perspective and not the type of reactionary politics podcasts like Pod Save America. <ETA>: A little while ago I learned that some people view Intercepted as a \"conspiracy theory\" type publication. I don't see it, but I guess it has a reputation as such. :shrug:<Psilocybology>: Yeah I can't say I always agree with everything either, but it definitely gets me thinking about things in ways that I appreciate. The episode that really did it for me was when they had Noam Chomsky on, that was probably my favorite. I can see how some people might say that; there are some aspects of the show that I've felt that way about. But what's scary is that things like systemic racism and the criminal justice system or the influence of money in politics, they're not conspiracies, even though they can sound like they are. I haven't come across anything when listening though that to me seemed to actually cross into the realm of conspiracy. <DTownForever>: There was a bonus episode a while back where they played this amazing lecture by Nikhil Pal Singh - October 5th is the date it aired.

This is not to brag, but to prove a point... I have tried multiple times to get approval on being a monetized member of soundcloud. We have had a super-pro-$15/mo account for 2+ years, we have over 25k downloads, no copyright strikes, etc. They will not let us sign up because (email from them directly): \"The reason you aren't eligible for Premier might be because plays for some of your tracks seem to be unauthentic. I'm afraid we cannot disclose how we differentiate authentic from unauthentic plays but we do perform filtering when considering creators for eligibility to Premier Monetization.\" I have asked them multiple times if there were any other holdups and their response has been that phrase, word for word, every time. We have no other things that would prevent us from getting paid. It's additionally insulting that they will not outright confirm a problem with their system or, worse, are flat out refusing to pay us after offering the program to paying members. Our works have over 1,000 downloads/month on obscure apps, and well over 50k on mainstream ones. <Either>: A. Over 96% of their listeners are fake/bots aka \"Inauthentic\". B. They are deliberately denying creators who are eligible to monetize. We have never paid money to advertise our Soundcloud, nor have we ever engaged in paid social media boosting, so we shouldn't have any bots. Either outcome from Soundcloud is seriously troublesome and you should all be aware of it.<Pilebsa>: If you are a content creator, why dilute your equity by using an aggregator? If you're responsible for your traffic, fuck SoundCloud. Don't give them your hard-earned traffic if they're not going to pay you. What we're seeing here is the beginning of the Internet becoming a tool mainly for elites. Yea, you can find free hosting of your content IF you let them exploit it. Otherwise it will cost you more and more to make that content available to the masses in ways you have control over. This is what happens without net neutrality. Less outlets to host your content on. Fewer hosting providers. Higher costs for hosting. More stringent terms on what you can and can't do with your content. Welcome to the future. Please vote.<ArchonReeve>: TBH RSS aggregators like Libsyn are pretty great. The price of automation, quality reporting, and actual customer service (plus the occasional advertising lead or push onto a new platform) is worth the $5-$15/month. Soundcloud in particular isn't transparent, and is trying to build their brand by saying they'll pay you if you get big, which I'm calling foul on.<Pilebsa>: Unless they give you access to the server logs, you can't trust any of the metrics they're claiming, good or bad. Ultimately, the only way to know if you have traction is having fans directly interact with you. <ArchonReeve>: We have a high-functioning patreon, 800+ iTunes ratings, and daily fan interaction with different people. Unless 96% of our Soundcloud downloads are bots (per their reporting), we absolutely exceed 1k per month on Soundcloud alone. Their reports are, in theory, what they should be holding creators accountable to.<Pilebsa>: Why would you mess with Soundcloud if you have Patreon working? That's like collecting aluminum cans after you won the lottery. <ArchonReeve>: If you made under $30k/year working 50+ hours a week, and could make an extra $300 a month by clicking 'yes, opt in', you'd understand how big of a game-changer this could have been.<Pilebsa>: $300/mo?

Did Soundcloud actually say you were going to get $300/mo? <ArchonReeve>: Their new release promises a $0.007 per play if you subscribe to their Pro level ($10-15/mo) and opt into the program, which, for me would equate to about $300/mo.<Pilebsa>: Hmmm, well I guess there are some catches to that.. doh", "num_messages": 12, "avg_score": 11.3333333333}

The premise is it\u2019s a true crime podcast about bodies that are found in barrels in the woods, and no one knows who they are, so not only are they trying to find who put them there they also have to find out the victims. I don\u2019t want to give anymore away, but I will also add that this is one of the first cases to use familial DNA to identify someone, so it was kind of the case that started all this. Such a good podcast!!!<Sophhfb>: Perfect summary! I really enjoyed the true crime mystery aspect but also the development of DNA and how it's used in law enforcement and the exploration of the moral implications of what science is now capable of!", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 59.25}

If you flip through all the AM radio channels you quickly find that besides a few Christian gospel channels, Foreign language shows and Alex Jones, there's pretty much nothing but static.

Thanks in advance! <Pilebsa>: If you really want to understand cause and effect, I would recommend watching two key documentaries that basically set the stage for what's going on politically in America (both free and available online): 1. [The Corporation](https://youtu.be/xHrhqtY2khc) - traces the history of the entity, the \"corporation\" and how it works and how it has evolved to have so much political power. 2. [Manufacturing Consent](https://youtu.be/AnrBQEAM3rE) - Noam Chomsky's highly-regarded analysis of how private interests are able to manipulate people and public opinion and appropriate government. <jmnugent>: My big problem with these kinds of \"documentaries\" (I put that in quotes for a reason).. is that they use a lot of really hyperbolic fast-edit / jump-cut type of dramatization clips.. that are kind of \"rapid fire\" and loosely strung together \"facts\". Presented in a way that doesn't let you (or allow for) you to slow down and think-for-yourself. Even if there are some kernels of truth underlying it.. it's presented in a way that largely comes off as brainwashing and propaganda. It's cute if you're a 1st year college student in a Gov/Philosophy class.. but if you spend 2 or 3 decades out in the real world.. you'll realize \"documentaries\" like this are just glossy surface coverage of issues that are much larger and much deeper and much more complex and nuanced. <Pilebsa>: In other words, you object to the \"tone\" of the content, but not the actual content? That doesn't seem to reflect a true desire to learn the truth. <jmnugent>: No, I object to the distorted way its presented. Truth is subjective (and especially dangerous anytime someone tries to pressure/convince you that their truth is the correct truth). I prefer facts that cannot be twisted by agendas. <Pilebsa>: &gt; No, I object to the distorted way its presented. Can you cite something specific? Or is this just a \"feeling\" you have? &gt;I prefer facts that cannot be twisted by agendas. *Everybody* has bias. There is no way to tell any story without someone's agenda getting intertwined into it. If you are aware of inaccuracies in claims in something, **point those out specifically**. If you're just vaguely commenting that you don't trust the information because of the way it's presented, that doesn't tell any of us anything. And it's not enough to condemn the source. In a perfect world, every podcast, every movie, every song would be composed in the perfect manner that makes us most comfortable. But this isn't a perfect world. So we have to adapt. We have to read-between-the-lines. We have to do our own homework. In the meantime, if you can cite something specifically errant about anything I posted, I want to know. I'm not concerned about how you feel about it. Don't imply there are inaccuracies unless you're going to **cite them**. <jmnugent>: Again.. I never said it was \"inaccurate\". What I said was that it's * Distorted presentation (it's only trying to get you to swallow the BAD side of media.. it doesn't represent both sides fairly or evenly). * and it's presented in a way that tries to \"convince you WHAT to think\".. instead of simply presenting facts and giving you freedom to make up your own mind (free from influence). Anytime a video is trying to convince you to believe a certain way.. you should always distrust that.. because they likely have an agenda. With videos like \"Manufacturing Consent\".. there's a prevailing bias and distortion that people are \"ignorant and unwilling rubes\" who are easily tricked and that the Media has some Orwellian overarching power to manipulate people in any way they want. That's just bullshit. Information only has power over you if you let it. (and you have the choice of whether to let it or not). We see that in society all around us today.. with all the divisiveness and tribalism and political-extremism from all sorts of different groups. The average citizen/end-user needs to: * Practice better critical-thinking * Get their news/media from a wider variety of sources That's all. That's it. This broad-brush stereotyping and hyperbolic nonsense of \"ALL MEDIA IS BAD\" ... is part of the problem. Because by approaching it that way, is just adding to the partisanship, divisiveness and hyperbolic knee-jerk reactions. What we should be doing is creating a Documentary that shows the average citizen how to be a better critical-thinker. How to evaluate information and understand how to separate opinion and claims and speculation from facts and unbiased information. Manufacturing Consent doesn't do that. All it does is pound you over the head with a big stick.. trying to convince you there's only 1 explanation.. and that is \"media is bad\". All those documentaries (Century of the Self, The Corporation, Manufacturing Consent,etc).. all seem to take that same style/approach: * Rapid fire \"facts\".. presented over quickly flashing video-clips of hyperbolic examples .. that are meant to illicit an emotional reaction instead of free thought. No good documentary should do that. Good documentaries should present the information in a calm and rational way, ESPECIALLY presenting BOTH SIDES of the information.. and ESPECIALLY presenting it in a way that leaves you free to make up your mind yourself. You should never finish a documentary thinking \"Well.. I'm convinced!\"... that's the surest sign of a failed documentary. You should always finish a Documentary thinking \"Wow.. there's a lot of good information to digest there. I'm going to have to take my time thinking about that and go do more research and try to understand the Pros/Cons of this topic before I come to any conclusion.\" Thats the biggest irony about videos like this. They purport to warn you against \u201cpropaganda\u201d,.. but they themselves are propaganda. <Pilebsa>: &gt; With videos like \"Manufacturing Consent\".. there's a prevailing bias and distortion that people are \"ignorant and unwilling rubes\" who are easily tricked and that the Media has some Orwellian overarching power to manipulate people in any way they want. This is a strawman argument, like the rest of your claims. &gt;Manufacturing Consent doesn't do that. All it does is pound you over the head with a big stick.. trying to convince you there's only 1 explanation.. and that is \"media is bad\". Again, a strawman. The documentary doesn't say that. And it's a false dichotomy to suggest it's either \"all media is bad\" or \"all media is good.\" You're arguing against an imaginary position that's the result of your own bias, not the actual film. The doc does not call people \"ignorant and unwilling rubes\" but it does demonstrate various examples of how people can be manipulated by media. That's the whole point! I think this just flew right over your head. And likewise, a documentary like \"The Corporation\" which is presenting a case for why corporations have no mandate to be ethical, has an ominous soundtrack.. that's part of the presentation. If you're a smart, independent thinker, you should be able to recognize that. It seems ironic you argue people aren't \"ignorant and unwilling rubes\" but at the same time, you don't want to watch those films because apparently, you're not capable of identifying what is true and what is propaganda? Wow. Do you not see the hypocrisy? <jmnugent>: &gt; Others may find the videos full of a lot of useful information. Then they're idiots. &gt; \"The information is presented in a way that is more dramatic. That's the nature of the medium.\" No.. that's propaganda. &gt; \"I'm curious, do you complain about super hero movies having more explosions than are necessary to convey the appropriate message?\" No. .because super hero movies are fictional. Videos like \"Manufacturing Consent\".... are presented/purporting to be an \"accurate encapsulation of Media\"... and they are not. It's a dramatic and distorted hyperbole.. meant to tug at your emotional response. Like I said.. it's purporting to \"warn you against propaganda\".. but itself IS propaganda. That people just blindly accept it.. is feeding into the problem it claims to be fighting against. <Pilebsa>: &gt; Then they're idiots. This conversation has now degenerated into preschool name-calling. Good luck with life. <jmnugent>: *shrug* .. I'm pretty good at critical-thinking and avoiding propaganda... so I think I'll do just fine. <Pilebsa>: And you also know everything.... and apparently a world-renown MIT professor has absolutely no wisdom to impart to you. <jmnugent>: And again.. you don't seem to understand that it's not WHAT is being said.. but HOW it's being said. Media certainly isn't perfect. I'd agree with that. But it's not some overarching satanic evil either. Part of the individuals job.. is to use critical thinking to cut through all the misinformation and bias. To get your information from a wide variety of different sources. To put the effort into filtering and sorting through all the information you get and separating the good from the bad. You have to do your own homework. You can't just sit blindly back and expect a documentary to convince you of a certain position. Are you a passive zombie?.. or are you going to think for yourself ? If this documentary presented both sides (the good and the bad).. and gave examples from both sides.. and then ended by saying \"Now it's up to you -- to put the effort into finding the right media sources that fit your needs\".. . .. then that would be totally fine and I would 100% support it. But it doesn't do that. <Pilebsa>: &gt; And again.. you don't seem to understand that it's not WHAT is being said.. but HOW it's being said. I understand completely. How it's being said is peripheral to what is being said. You are suggesting it's just as important. But it's not. A fact is a fact. If I tell you that fact under red lighting with dramatic music, it does not in any way, make that fact any less factual. And as far as the \"gotta show both sides\" argument, I'll refer you to a famous [Jon Stewart appearance on CNN Crossfire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE) where he skewers that false equivalence. Not all sides of an issue are equally legitimate or worthy of consideration. That myth is one of the most destructive ones in our social and political system nowadays. If you want to do a story on civil rights, the idea that you're not truly being \"fair and balanced\" if you don't give half the time to neo-nazi rantings, is completely absurd. <jmnugent>: &gt; \"How it's being said is peripheral to what is being said.\" No. It's not. HOW something is said is critically important. &gt; \"A fact is a fact.\" And if a documentary is presenting those facts in a distorted/dramatic way to make them appear to show/imply something that's not factually true.. then those \"facts\" are undercut by the distorted presentation. &gt; \"If I tell you that fact under red lighting with dramatic music, it does not in any way, make that fact any less factual.\" No. .but doing so may distort the perception enough to make someone think the the fact means something it does not. And that's the problem. That's where this documentary goes wrong. Media isn't perfect.. and it certainly is guilty of certain types of propaganda.. but it's also not the \"all seeing and all-manipulative evil\" that the documentary's tone seems to imply it is. <Pilebsa>: Let me repeat what I said: &gt; If I tell you that fact under red lighting with dramatic music, it does not in any way, make that fact any less factual. You have to decide if you're going to get bogged down in the peripheral bullshit, or you're going to use your \"critical thinking skills\" like you say you have, to isolate the relevant information. It must be nice to think that everything on this planet can/should be tailor-made to your specific aesthetic sensibilities. Your criticism of the method of delivery of the information is based on *subjective* criteria. If you isolated particular claims and showed they were false, then you'd be making an objective claim. But you're not. And I hate to break it to you, you're not the only person who has the capacity to have subjective feelings about stuff. The way we find middle ground isn't to suggest everybody deliver information that pleases our subjective opinion. It's to skip over that stuff and get to the meat of the matter. You continue to distract from the cogent points, getting bogged down in unrelated minutiae. That's your problem. Not the problem of the film's producers. The moment you actually cite something specific that you can prove is errant, then you move into the realm of having an intelligent, objective, relevant claim. In the meantime, you're no different than a typical uninformed voter who rejects massive amounts of information wholesale, because he doesn't like who said it. For example, if you show me a video of Rush Limbaugh making a claim about global warming in his typical smarmy, condescending way, I could easily take the low ground and dismiss the claim because I am not a fan of Limbaugh or I don't like the tone of his voice. *But*, the more intelligent, rational response would be to look aside from his delivery and address the actual claim he's making. You are doing the former. I advocate doing the latter. In both cases, people may come to the right decision, but one person has found truth, and the other has merely reinforced his own prejudices, and is no closer to understanding what is and isn't real. If you wholesale dismiss information merely because you don't like the way it's delivered, you are handicapping your ability to see the truth. That's not critical thinking. That's ideological and emotional blindness. <jmnugent>: A classic example of how important perspective and presentation is: https://imgur.com/CMykxFC <Pilebsa>: Completely irrelevent and unrelated to the argument at hand.

I originally was calling it What Makes You Happy? and I really like the name because it leaves my topic options wide enough that I can theoretically talk to anyone who has a hobby as well as anyone even tangentially involved with mental health. Unfortunately, the name What Makes You Happy? is kind of taken. There is a podcast named Whatever Makes You Happy that I don't want to be confused with. Even their visual branding is similar to what I came up with. Here's a brief description of the show itself: WMYH is a show that explores hobbies and pastimes and how they delight us. The show also explores the nature of happiness itself, and how people use hobbies to make themselves happier. In a given episode, we might be speaking to a guest hobbyist, learning more about their chosen hobby. In another, we may be speaking to a mental health professional, a philosopher, or a spiritual leader about the nature of happiness, and how hobbies in general can help or hinder that. Thanks so much for any help you can give. I've got a few episodes recorded already, I think it's going to be a great show. &amp;#x200B; <Edit>: I ended up calling it What Makes You Happy? as originally intended. The other podcast with the same name hasn't been active for at least 3 years. You can check it out here: [http://clevelandcreativeoutlet.com/wmyh/](http://clevelandcreativeoutlet.com/wmyh/)<Solarbg>: I made a podcast series exactly like this called ''Time For Your Hobby''. I have interviews with everyday people to find out what their hobby means to them, how it had an impact on their lives and get rid of any misconceptions. You could call yours : ''Hobby O Clock'' ''Pass Time With Pass Times'' ''The Happy Hobby'' ''The World Of Hobbies'' &amp;#x200B; Send me the link once you have your first episode, I would love to listen to it.<dezstern>: Is Time for Your Hobby still being published? Would love to listen to it! &amp;#x200B; Thanks for your suggestions! I really appreciate it.<Solarbg>: Indeed it is, I just started the show in September and the interviews are coming along great and to be honest the best part of the whole podcast is the 1 on 1 conversation with my guest.
