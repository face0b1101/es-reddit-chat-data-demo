If they do go forward then fantastic and I'm happy to be wrong in this case. However if they try to shift cast members mid-story and continue that way I may be out.

The old stuff hasn't aged well AT ALL. <DongleNocker>: Well in terms of special effects, set building, and costumes? I agree they are horrible compared to what is possible today, technology and budgets simply wasn't there. On the other hand, the writing was many times better. I find Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker's era of Doctor Who more enjoyable on the whole because of it. <ubermonkey>: &gt; On the other hand, the writing was many times better. Really? I find everything from that era -- not just Doctor Who -- to be embarrassingly stilted with few exceptions. People don't act or talk or even move naturally; it was the style of TV back then. By the 4th Doctor things were a LITTLE better, but the plots were still incredibly simple and generally lacking in any sort of nuance. (Again, not just a Doctor Who thing -- it was that way in most TV well into the 90s.) <DongleNocker>: &gt;People don't act or talk or even move naturally; we are talking about science fiction where the setting too often isn't on earth and the characters aren't human. <edit>: I also forgot to mention the time travel aspect as well. <ubermonkey>: Yes, we are. The subject matter is pretty irrelevant to this critique. Do you see why? <DongleNocker>: I see you point, but think they are irrelevant due to the subject matter. It is science fiction... why would an alien or even a human from another time and planet \"People don't act or talk\" like what you would consider naturally? <ubermonkey>: People don't stop being people because something extraordinary happens, and if there's one central theme in Who is that's the aliens are almost all still people, at least morally speaking. All TV and most film through the 70s is really stilted and awkward when compared to modern works. The style of the time called for a weird formalism in the way people spoke, moved, and interacted -- and this is true for stories about regular human concerns as well as for stories about Time Lords. It's part of what makes all older TV feel hokey and dated, even if there aren't any special effects. And Doctor Who doesn't get a pass just because of its plots. (Also, you're really close to an argument fanboys/Stans make when a given franchise/story is dinged for logical inconsistencies borne of poor worldbuilding or bad continuity choices. Someone asks a valid question about why Harry or Luke or whomever does a thing that seems, upon examination, to be silly in the context of the fictional world, and the Stan says \"But it's a story about wizards / space wars / whatever! It's all unrealistic!\" as though that explains it. The argument doesn't work there, either.)<DongleNocker>: &gt;People don't stop being people because something extraordinary happens, and if there's one central theme in Who is that's the aliens are almost all still people, at least morally speaking. Not really. But hey, whatever you want it to be I guess. <ubermonkey>: Well, let me clarify, because it doesn't seem like you're engaging with any of this (analysis or Who itself) on more than a surface level: Obviously the horror of the Daleks is that they are so utterly NOT human, but MOST of the time, when we encounter aliens in Who that aren't actively hostile to the Doctor and his companions, they are essentially human in nature if not biology or whatever. First and foremost, we have the Doctor. Much is made of the two-hearts, nearly-immortal nature of the Time Lord, but the reason we parse the Doctor as a hero is because s/he acts heroically in human terms, and leads by embodying values we recognize as human. Be kind. Help people. Never be cruel. Then we have the vast array of human-shaped aliens we've encountered. The most recent example this season is probably Yoss, the pregnant man from the Tsuranga / PTing episode. Obviously, if he's a *pregnant man* he's not human by physiological standards, but his fear and anxiety about his pregnancy, and his need for companionship in the process, and his awe at fatherhood, are all very human traits. He's not a Human, but he's certainly very human. That's the kind of thing I mean. It isn't just \"aliens who look human,\" either. We have plenty of other examples, like Madam Vastra, or even Kamelion, who are obviously not physically human, but function in the story as human-relatable characters with human emotions, motivations, and arcs. So yes, **really**. <DongleNocker>: &gt;Obviously the horror of the Daleks is that they are so utterly NOT human, but MOST of the time, when we encounter aliens in Who that aren't actively hostile to the Doctor and his companions, they are essentially human in nature if not biology or whatever. Not really, especially in the real/original Doctor Who. In the original doctor who you were always presented with how someone presents themselves vs how they actually take action. And the reboot series, seldom if every has that layer of complexity or realism. &gt;First and foremost, we have the Doctor. Much is made of the two-hearts, nearly-immortal nature of the Time Lord, but the reason we parse the Doctor as a hero is because s/he acts heroically in human terms, and leads by embodying values we recognize as human. Be kind. Help people. Never be cruel. That isn't really the truth, whenever the doctor chooses a side the other side will suffer, because he's decided which side better. You have the mistaken idea that the doctor is some absolute of morality. I'm not sure what having two hearts has anything to do with it, other than a distinct method to show he isn't human. &gt;The most recent example this season is probably Yoss, the pregnant man from the Tsuranga / PTing episode. Doctor Who ended last season, whatever is being made more recently is like someone re-animating a dead body to create a zombie and telling you loved one came back to life. It isn't Doctor Who anymore. I think you are too caught up in the not so great and rather awful \"new who\" and need to go back and watch the foundation of the series to see how they are mucking up the franchise. <ubermonkey>: Wow, you seem to have especially poor reading comprehension. OTOH, this explains your odd take on Who generally. &amp; also... &gt; Doctor Who ended last season, whatever is being made more recently is like someone re-animating a dead body to create a zombie and telling you loved one came back to life. It isn't Doctor Who anymore. I see that you're one of *those* sort.. I cannot IMAGINE why you draw such a bright line between seasons. Really. I'm completely stumped. <DongleNocker>: &gt;Wow, you seem to have especially poor reading comprehension. OTOH, this explains your odd take on Who generally. Nope, I just whole heartily disagree with your conclusions and place much more weight on the original series as the definition to what Doctor Who is and should be. &gt;I cannot IMAGINE why you draw such a bright line between seasons. Really. I'm completely stumped. Doctor who changes, but there are always things that don't. They have changed one one too many of those things that did not during the original series. Time to pull it back and return to something closer to the source material on what the current series is based. <ubermonkey>: &gt;They have changed one one too many of those things that did not during the original series. Just come out and say it. You post in MGTOW. It's clear where you stand on issues of gender. If you're going to be pissed off about a woman playing the Doctor, don't mince about with dog whistles. Of course, the problem with being up front about that position is that most people won't bother giving you the time of day. For example, if it had been clear to me at the outset what sort of bitter weirdo you were, I wouldn't have replied to you in the first place. Fortunately, RES allows me to tag you, so I won't make that mistake again. <DongleNocker>: My posting in other subs and on other topics is not relevant to this conversation and your stalking creepy. &gt;It's clear where you stand on issues of gender. It isn't about gender, I welcome another Doctor Who spin off with a female main characater. If you want to have a show based on a female timelord character, pick one of the many pre-existing (Susan, Romana, The Rani, etc.) or create a new one. But, the Doctor himself has always been a male role model for boys and young men, especially when he was created in the 1960's when so many fathers and grand fathers had died in both of the world wars. This is like recasting great female main characters like wonder woman, Laura Croft, Ripley, Dana Scully, Leeloo, or Sarah Conner as a man. <ubermonkey>: When you encounter someone with weird ideas, it's often illustrative to take a look at their posting history. If you don't like people can see what you've written, well, maybe be more circumspect about what you put out there. So I took a look, and what I found was a bitter MGTOW sort, and consequently I'm utterly unsurprised that you're butthurt about Whittaker despite the fact that this character has changed bodies on the regular for half a century (unlike any of the rest you name). The Doctor's still a role model, for people of all genders -- at least, if you're not some weirdo misogynist. But if that describes you, none of the prior Doctors would really be appropriate role models, either. Oh, btw: &gt;If you want to have a show based on a female timelord character, pick one of the many pre-existing We did! It's called *Doctor Who*, and it's fabulous.", "num_messages": 18, "avg_score": 24.1111111111}

Maybe something like: a court-room drama set in 2150; a small-town murder mystery in a world with elves and orcs; A story of a single mom, who happens to live in the last metropolis on Earth-2, and the hardships she's going through trying to provide for her three half-human/half-formic babies?

Both of those stories could ONLY occur in those worlds, I want something like My Dinner With Andre, that just also happens to be sci-fi. Something that focuses on the everyday, normal people who live in those worlds. A character-driven drama that slightly touches on the sci-fi or fantasy world it's in, but which doesn't draw all of its entertainment from it.

Just thought here would be a good place to ask for some help. Currently I am using The Borg from Star Trek as a case study for the representation of collectivism, as well as others such as the Cybermen from Doctor Who. If anyone has any other recommendations of good examples of science fiction that features strong allegories for the battle between individualism and collectivism, please let me know. Thanks in advance. <APeacefulWarrior>: Atlas Shrugged is science fiction, even if most Randroids don't want to admit it. And given Ayn Rand's prominence in this particular debate, you'd be remiss not to cover it. I'd also suggest checking out the works of Eric Frank Russell, an often-overlooked silver era sci-fi writer who is probably the most openly libertarian of a bunch of sci-fi writers who tended that way. His short story \"And Then There Were None\" is pretty representative of his beliefs, basically a utopia of an ultra-individualist society that slowly converts a ship of military men to their way of life. IIRC, it's online for free if you Google it. <Edit>: Oh, and don't forget \"Invasion Of The Body Snatchers,\" particularly the 1950s version which is widely interpreted as being an allegory for individualism vs communism.<c4tesys>: Ayn Rand's Anthem is a much shorter, easier read, and more sci-fi/fantasy than Atlas Shrugged. It's central conceit is that of individualism vs. collectivism, and it inspired the Canadian band RUSH's 2112 which is also about an individual vs. an authoritarian regime which bans music. Unfortunately Anthem's conclusion, private ownership of house/land &amp; the fruits of one's own labour, is unsustainable imo. Nevertheless, it's a decent book that can rub shoulders with the biggies: 1984 &amp; A Brave New World. To OP: you're including those two, right??<APeacefulWarrior>: &gt;Ayn Rand's Anthem is a much shorter, easier read, and more sci-fi/fantasy than Atlas Shrugged. But also much less commonly read, and less influential on the overall debate that OP is looking at. I mean, it was Atlas Shrugged that distilled out all political discussion and reduced the entire debate down to \"individualism vs collectivism\" in the first place. It's the book that basically defined the topic that OP is covering. Besides, they can just read Wiki articles. I'm certainly not suggesting they try to read it cover to cover. God no. (Although, I would take issue with saying Anthem is \"more\" sci-fi than Atlas. The entire plot of Atlas revolves around brilliant engineers and scientists developing new technologies, and then building their idea of a better society around those technologies. Her idea of a better society may be a bunch of sociopathic monsters who deliberately destroy civilization so that they can rule over the remains, but it still fits any reasonable definition of \"sci-fi.\")", "num_messages": 4, "avg_score": 1.25}

Usually venturing pretty far into fantasy. Hard sci-fi is pretty straight forward. Space ships and aliens. Pulp with as much logic as possible. Most writers do a little of both.<Hieron_II>: I have to disagree with your opinions on hard / soft Sci Fi. Hard Sci Fi can have neither space ships &amp; aliens, nor pulp. Soft Sci Fi can make zero use of science fiction in it's talking about the nature of man or extrapolating histories, turning all the Sci Fi elements into a backdrop. Hard Sci Fi is about getting the science right, or, at least, not getting it obviously wrong. For obvious reasons, it is better suited to \"extrapolate future histories\" - that is called \"futurology\", btw - cause you want your extrapolations based on good premises. Soft Sci Fi abandons strict adherence to science for more creative freedom. How exactly this freedom gets used - depends on an author. \"Turning all the Sci Fi elements into a backdrop\" is one possible outcome.", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 2.0}

How many members of those \u201cgeneral audiences\u201d saw the original trilogy in the theatre before the prequels were made? How many saw the prequels before the original trilogy? How many had a developmental disability? How many had been impregnated by a sibling? My point is that general audiences can be quite dumb. No one with a fully functioning brain, who was previously exposed to the original trilogy and the prequels, would think TLJ is better than Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith.

No novelist had described aliens and intergalactic relations like that before. I was especially thrilled by the larger-than-life Nicholas van Rijn and his genius. Over the years, I've sporadically read other stories in Poul Anderson's Polesotechnic League universe. Yesterday I finished another anthology of his stories and was again blown away. One unique thing about Poul Anderson was how he built and described planets/stars and the subsequent effect on the evolution of sentient beings. I'm yet to come across any scifi writer who did this better than Poul Anderson. The attached picture is from the afterword to 'The Man Who Counts. For fans of Poul Anderson, I found an amazing blog where a few people have spent years discussing and analyzing all of his written works. I could spend a whole week on that blog and not get tired. It's poulandersonappreciation.blogspot.com So far, my interest in Poul Anderson is within the Polesotechnic League era, starring van Rijn and David Falkyn. After readin all the stories and novels of that era, I'll move to the era of the Terran Empire and Dominic Flandry. <daralick>: The Mote In God's Eye and followup The Gripping Hand are great reads.

That's because an Internet hate-bubble is not necessarily reflective of larger global reality. There are plenty of people who enjoyed TLJ, but the over-the-top response to it from certain corners of the Internet made it impossible to have any kind of reasonable or measured debate about it. So a lot of people just gave up trying to talk about it. When one side is saying, \"Hey, it was a pretty good movie with some big ideas and a few notable flaws,\" and the other side is saying \"OMG WORST MOVIE EVER SJW BULLSHIT RAPED MY CHILDHOOD\" it's pretty hard to find much common ground for discussion.<daedalus4210>: I\u2019m surprised because I literally don\u2019t know anyone personally who liked it, and more than half on the internet said they did.

Also, initial audience polls of people walking out of the theater gave it an A rating. And speaking personally, I *liked* that it did new things - especially after being somewhat disappointed at how much of a retread EP 7 was. Yes, Johnson probably did go a bit too far about subverting expectations, and maybe shouldn't have pulled quite so many rugs out from under people. But it set up the first Star Wars movie I've seen in ages where, from start to finish, I really had no idea what was going to happen next. And as someone who's a \"first generation\" Star Wars fan, I really appreciated that. Like the throne room scene. Going into it, I honestly wasn't sure if Rey was going to team up with Kylo Ren or not. Her going to the dark side actually seemed like a *possibility*. That's really impressive dramatically, considering how formulaic most space operas tend to be. Plus, strong performances, genuinely excellent cinematography, recognizable character arcs, and generally well-articulated themes. It was a *good* movie.

Number two on the list<raevnos>: If you like that concept, track down [The City, Not Long After](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City,_Not_Long_After).<-MarcoPolo->: Thanks for the replay. I just recently got some more time to read. Am afraid of classics of sci-fi coz if they put more pressure on tech than on story/universe-wide questions Im afraid Im gonna get put off. What u r showing is 1989 and I will... check it out after this book Ancillary Justice right now Im reading. U gonna go to my kinda new - one year old - bookmarks READ. From my side, not so small investment into SAGA comics is pretty much worth it. But Im new. And everything new is great for me so", "num_messages": 3, "avg_score": 0.6666666667}

I like how it gets to the point pretty quickly as I have found (whilst I liked the other books) they dragged out some parts which I found ruined the pace from time to time. I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations of some other books to check out once I've finished this? One of the other things I liked about Rama was the size.

It's the worst thing ever. But it absolutely does not even in the slightest ruin the original for me. I still watch it all the time. You wanna hate the live action?

[deleted]<Bardzly>: I haven't seen the numbers and I can't speak for everyone, but as a youngish reader I do fit more into the trend of preferring fantasy to sci-fi (in general). There are some fantastic sci-fi books and writers I love. Iain M Banks' culture series have been some of my favourite books all around, and David Brin is one of my favourite writers. Personally though I've found fantasy easier to read. I can't say exactly why that is, but I've found that reading sci-fi doesn't drag me in in the same way and I have to be really invested in the plot and or characters to keep reading to the end. On the other hand, fantasy seems to be easier for me to read and just immerse myself in. I personally think that part of it has to do with my suspension of disbelief. When I go into fantasy books its with the precognition that Gods exist, magic is a thing and the society is how it is. Don't question it. (Though the best writers always support it well). Mostly when I go into Sci-Fi, I find that the attempt to explain how the world / cosmos became as it is starts to grind on me and I have a harder time immersing myself in the book. In terms of escapism, I've found that in most fantasy books as well, the protagonists are empowered to change their entire world (a chosen one plot etc.), Whereas in most sci-fi stories, the protagonists may change their situation, but less often do they change an entire world and at least in the books I've read are more often actors within a world than chosen ones changing it (with some notable exceptions obviously). Just my 2 cents, it won't apply to everyone, but with enough input it might help narrow it down.<Crazytowndarling>: As a response to you comment about explanations of \u2018the story of the universe up to those point\u2019, I would say Randolph Lalonde\u2019s Spinward Fringe series is a great example of doing this the right way. He sprinkles little nuggets of it in throughout his books. He reveals it in a very organic way and VERY rarely info dumps. <Bardzly>: Sounds interesting.

The one that stood out was one of a robot on an Earth devoid of humans. A robot had experienced damage to his power supply, and so had to prey on other robots for their power, which ends up destroying them (something about the positronic brains needed to be powered at all times or the memory would be wiped). He meets a human who stays in a crypt in the middle of a cemetery, who is actually a vampire. As things turn out, an angry mob of robot villagers come out to burn the vampire robot, but his vampire friend comes out into the daylight to say he is not the killer they are looking for. The robots promptly accept the humans word as the truth and the vampire ends up turning to dust in the sun. I've tried my considerable Google-fu, but this seems too obscure even for this. **Edit: Poul Anderson was not involved in the creation of this book. It was Roger Zelazny**<Sharrukin-of-Akkad>: That sounds a *little* like Anderson's story \"Epilogue,\" but I don't think that's it - there's nothing like a human vampire in that.

It's great on audiobook. She reads her own work and it's both a solid story and solid performance. I recommend it quite highly. I just finished listening the sequel, _The Fated Sky, and it's also excellent. I hope she does more. By complete coincidence, I listened to _The Calculating Stars_ right after finishing Rebecca Traister's _Good and Mad_. (That's not sci-fi. It's more social/political, a study in women's anger written as a companion to the \"me too\" movement.) _The Calculating Stars_ puts the many issues Traister raises into clear focus in a series of worked examples, but yet manages not to be tedious about it.<neuromonkey>: Cool, thanks! I'll put Kowal's books near the top of my \"next up\" list!<netsettler>: For what it's worth, if it's the sort of thing you ever do, I really recommend Traister's book, too, I meant to say. It is extremely well-organized and a very nice study in the modern history and even ethics of anger, a topic I'd have expected to be pretty disorganized. Anger and injustice is a complex topic people probably don't think enough about, though sci-fi sometimes confronts it usefully. I found it to be a really nice flow from one book to the other.<neuromonkey>: Interesting. Thanks! Anger is definitely a topic that's been on my mind over the past couple of years.<netsettler>: One of the many things that impressed me with the book is its sense of nuance. Distinguishing between anger as a positive motivating force when things are awry, and anger as a negative once normalcy has been restored is an example; that is, not going too far. But the book is full of subtle distinctions that are visited one at a time in a form that attach a lot of organization to a messy topic. I hope you enjoy it as much as my wife and I did.<neuromonkey>: Huh. Even more interesting. I've heard that anger management tries to distinguish between *feeling* anger and *acting* upon it, particularly acting upon impulse. I feel it's a very poorly explored emotion, at least in constructive ways. It seems to motivate so much in the modern world, and there's so little analysis of it, beyond the most superficial acknowledgement that it exists.

If you really want strong scientific/engineering, though, read absolutely everything by Daniel Suarez, starting with \"Daemon\" and \"Freedom TM\" (Freedom is the sequel to Daemon). His books, mostly, just employ current technology in novel ways to change the world. Dune has way more advanced engineering, since it's projecting centuries into the future, but the stuff Suarez talks about is way closer to home.<shouldbebabysitting>: &gt;Oh man. You just got started. The absolute top classics, to me, are \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" and \"Dune\". Dune's what you'd prefer of those, going by your question - it takes engineering to universal extremes. I think it's weird you'd say Dune as heavy science scifi when to me the science is non existent and exists like magic in Lord of the Rings. It's a backdrop to tell a story but has no logic or scientific basis. If it was the 1960's it would get a pass because paranormal was still being studied. But now we know you can't actually change the world by dropping acid. <naught-me>: Well, I think it's pretty safe to say that, whatever tech they're using in 2000 years (or whatever), it'll be magic enough that we've got no business speculating except for entertainment. I wouldn't classify \"Dune\" as heavy on tech, for the same reasons, except that I love the idea that the highest technologies would be human advancements, ways to train humans to be superhuman (mentats, bene gesserits), and it's for sure a lot more tech-based than \"Stranger in a Strange Land\".

The rest simply didn't bring anything new to the table. What kills interest in modernised WotW for me is the simplistic storyline - that advanced aliens have no frigging clue about microbes. That was a perfectly fine and believable plot *when it was written* - after all, it was only the late 1800's when we discovered that microbes caused disease. The public knew nothing about them. But it's a \\*stupid\\* storyline now, for a modern scifi audience - unless it's set back in those times, in its original context. IMO if they want to set it in the present, they'll need to modernise that plot point - so it makes sense to a modern audience, yet somehow keeping that underlying message H.G. Wells wanted to portray - that we are endebted for our survival to the smallest of living creatures; the microbes, whose power and influence on our lives was first being realised during his lifetime. Otherwise, it's a story of advanced aliens somehow not realising they can't breathe our air. <ED>: I know! Make it a parable about how vaccinations are good for you! The aliens died because they weren't vaccinated against the common cold! Truly a message about microbes for modern times! :) <ED2>: Interesting trivia about microbes! A Dutch textile merchant, [Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/van_leeuwenhoek_antonie.shtml), was the first person to see \"tiny animals\" (he called them \"animalcules\") swimming in a drop of water, in 1676. Leeuwenhoek meticulously made his own lenses, for closely inspecting high quality linen etc. for his business. Thus he invented the most powerful \"microscope\" (the name wasn't coined yet) at the time, and that would exist for the next century. Made out of tiny, hand-made lenses, embedded in a small copper plate, he built about 240 of them over 50 years, but told nobody his secret of how they were made. He was later made a Fellow of the Royal Society for his discovery of \"animalcules\", what we now know of as \"microbes\". It took until 1876 for a German physician, Robert Koch, to prove that microbes can cause disease - an incredible revelation that completely changes our view of how the world works. Still a strange and mysterious topic 20 years later, Wells is inspired to pen \"War of the Worlds\" in 1895 (which I like to think of as a double-meaning - a war also between the normal world and the microscopic world). <Oolacileoona>: Eh I don't think its unbelievable. They probably knew about the physiology of earth but didnt anticipate all the possible chemical reactions that would destroy them. For all our advanced knowledge of chemistry we still cant anticipate all possible reactions. But I get what you mean. <waveform>: &gt; didnt anticipate all the possible chemical reactions that would destroy them But it wasn't that - Wells writes it was \"the smallest creatures that God himself put on Earth\" - i.e. microbes, disease, as they \"ate our food, breathed our air\". Pretty basic mistake to make for an alien, one would think. Then again, they never bothered testing a planet's air before beaming down in Star Trek either.<DiscoUnderpants>: It was the *point* of the story. The Martians are Victorian Englishmen. They are arrogant, violent and cruel to humans(ie people who arent Victorian Englishmen)<Onanipad>: Where did you get that from?<DiscoUnderpants>: Wells was deeply critical of the actions and behavior of his country. The journalist travels from Woking to London and encounters a pastor and a soldier who are pathetic. The great British Empire is being pounded to dust seemingly without effort. Wells hated the way indigenous people were treated by the empire, barely armed people being destroyed with superior arms and *disease*.", "num_messages": 9, "avg_score": 127.1111111111}

I think the fans get a lot of crap for expecting too much but if Star Wars didn't exist and that was the first movie in the series I would think it was made by a high school A/V class with a much bigger budget. The writing was horrible, the visual effects seemed unfinished, the plot was at best disjointed and there were so many cliche scenes I wanted to barf. The random cheesey jokes that were put in really just reminded me I was watching a Disney cartoon and the scenes that were obviously made to promote a ride at Disney World were . . .. obvious. The only redeeming attribute was most of the acting was spot on but you can almost tell they were trying so hard to make the bad writing come off as something good. I am not even a Star Wars fan so I can't imagine what the fans are feeling. What a shame. I know I am just heaping on to the pile but I just couldn't get over it this morning and needed to vent. <jeikaraerobot>: &gt;and needed to vent Well, have fun with this counterpoint, then. <Context>: the original trilogy bores me to death, the prequels I haven't bothered with, the seventh movie was less memorable to me than an average Dreamworks cartoon. So then, I absolutely felt that the Last Jedi was doing\u2014successfully\u2014a lot of very clever things plot-wise, e.g. Leia's survival, whatshisface goblin's unexpected death and a whole plethora of other potent story forks where it could really have *believably* gone either way: is she a traitor (she could very well be\u2014or not be), will he *not* go to the dark side (in this movie he very well might), etc. etc. To me, the best thing about the movie is how the plot forks believably (i.e. opens actual, feasible story options before resolving them) rather than stay on-rails and be 100% predictable like the rest of the franchise. Clearly, I look for completely different things in movies compared to you or some Star Wars fans. I value explicitly open-ended stories that seemingly develop right there on the screen\u2014stories that feel *gonzo*\u2014and finding a Star Wars movie that was actually like that bordered on being delightful. The set-in-stone roller-coaster of an average Star Wars movie bores me *to tears*.<WellGoodLuckWithThat>: I guess it was open-ended in the sense that they pretty much killed and nuked anything interesting remaining in the new trilogy, except Leia. So it left the next movie with pretty much any direction to go. But Carrie Fisher died so putting all their eggs in the girl power basket kind of backfired. They won't get to make the episode 9 where Leia helps Rey train a group of ethnically diverse all female Jedi with a few new easy to cosplay aliens thrown in to go take on the last interesting male character and his evil but newly ripped abdominal muscles.<jeikaraerobot>: &gt;they pretty much killed and nuked anything interesting remaining in the new trilogy Like what, for example? To me, the first (seventh) movie was a bland wasteland of pallid *nothing*.<WellGoodLuckWithThat>: Everybody interesting is dead, all that's left are goofy characters and a few Mary Sues. The movie ended and I couldn't really see where else it would go, and at the same time I stopped caring.<jeikaraerobot>: &gt;Everybody interesting is dead What, like in Hamlet? Also, there was *nobody* interesting in the first (seventh) movie to carry over, in my opinion. &gt;The movie ended and I couldn't really see where else it would go But that's a sign of good writing! The Last Jedi wasn't all *that* well-written or anything, but that element is an *upside*, not a downside. A movie is supposed to be completely over by the end. Fishing for sequels is trashy film-making at its worst. Man, we look at movies *so* differently.<BaconBehemoth>: Hamlet didn\u2019t have a sequel.<jeikaraerobot>: You can't be any more wrong. It had numerous sequels, prequels and spin-offs (by different playwrights\u2014*exactly* like like the movie in question), including world-famous stuff by very high profile authors, e.g. Stoppard. Apply yourself, BaconBehemoth.<BaconBehemoth>: Hamlet by William Shakespeare was never intended to have a sequel. The fact that it is public domain, and OTHER people have written \"sequelae\" to it, is irrelevant. SW is episodic. They undercut every single plotline, leaving basically nothing to hang episode IX on. It's junk. Curb yourself jeikaraerobot.<jeikaraerobot>: Good job moving the goalposts from \"*didn't have a sequel*\" ([literally](https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/8ukg5c/so_i_finally_got_around_to_watching_the_last_jedi/e1hsnj5/)\\) to \"*wasn't expected to have a sequel by the original author*\". I'll allow this for once. So, what makes you so certain that Shakespeare definitely, certainly didn't intend Hamlet in particular to have a sequel? He wrote sequels *and* prequels to his plays. Also, **keep in mind** that the last two Star Wars movies have completely different writers and directors. Completely different people.<BaconBehemoth>: You started this argument by comparing TLJ with Hamlet... Laughable on it's face.

There should never have been a choice. Only destroy. And also cut like 90% of the overly pompous dialogue with the starchild. If you assume the \"Destroy\" ending is canon, there is a lot you can do with the recovery of galactic civilization. The mass relay network is damaged but not lost. The galaxy has united against the reapers, but now reconstruction will start. Old conflicts come back to the surface and new challenges come from the resurgent Krogans, and the Quarians settling their homeworld again for the first time in 300 years. The various sides will all race to salvage the remains of the destroyed Geth and Reapers in order to gain a technological edge over one another. Can the citadel council be reestablished? How much of the galaxy can they control with the network down? I could see one conflict center around what relays get repaired first. Also the new location of the citadel in orbit around Earth will bring accusations that Earth get favorable representation in the council. Meanwhile thousands of systems will be out of reach of a functioning relay, and unlikely to see a repair crew in a long time as repair is expensive and difficult and precious few have the expertise needed. A few decades later and these systems will be all but independent with massive piracy problems as relatively few vessels have the capacity to generate their own mass effect field for galactic travel. I see this as a universe with huge potential. Instead of Andromeda we should have seen new characters in this setting on new adventures. But that would require the original studio run it and not the paired down new studio they pushed Andromeda on.<AKA_Sotof>: I agree that if they had not gone with the starchild and done a suicide mission last arc then the game would have been good, but they didn't and they're not ever going to. As it stands that ending utterly ruined 3 excellent games and it deserves all the hate it gets. That said, I actually liked Andromeda for what it was. It wasn't spectacular which isn't good for an ME game, but it was good fun aside from that. Though, I really wish they would've nailed Andromeda better - it had a lot of potential it did not quite live up to. As for the continued Milky Way story... It's going to take a lot of work to recover from the giant pile of shit that is ME3s ending.<MoonPieMoney>: &gt; that ending utterly ruined 3 excellent games Hyperbole.

Lush, nuanced, and philosophical, the story grapples with the decline of the nation state, the rise of tech platforms, and reconciling sins of the past with dreams of the future. Craig Newmark calls it, \u201cA riveting cautionary tale about how the control of information could lead to new forms of democratic governance, or to accidental empires. Rooted in the current realities of the internet and social media, Borderless explores a near future in which our lives are shaped without our conscious consideration.\u201d Unlike any other book I\u2019ve written, Borderless had a title before I sat down to draft chapter one. The dismantling of borders is a powerful theme in my life, and I began to recognize it beneath the surface of the headlines. The characters, plot, and world gravitated around this core idea before falling into place as I made my way through the manuscript. I am a child of immigrants. My father is from Holland. My Jewish paternal grandfather was one of the only members of his family to survive World War II. He hid in a secret compartment while Nazi patrols searched their cramped apartment. Meanwhile, my paternal grandmother, a Protestant, became a secret agent of the Dutch resistance, ferrying information, supplies, and people out of the camps, even as she raised and protected her family. They fled to the United States when they worried that the Cold War might devolve into a third World War. My mother is from Vancouver. Her family immigrated to Canada from the Orkney Islands north of Scotland, and for them, British Columbia must have felt tropical. I have many fond memories of scrambling over rocks and sneaking through forests on Vancouver Island with my cousins. And, of course, huddling around the monitor\u2019s glow to play Final Fantasy VII while our parents shook their heads in bewilderment. My wife is from Colombia, and her family escaped the drug violence that plagued Cali by moving to Connecticut. Just before I embarked on Borderless, we volunteered with a local resettlement agency to host a Ugandan refugee in our home in Oakland. The initial commitment was for three months, but Marvin ended up staying for nine months and became a dear friend. We\u2019ve learned an enormous amount from each other, and he continues to find it quite odd that my \u201cjob\u201d is writing books. As I prepared to write this particular book, I couldn\u2019t help but notice how different our world today is from the one my grandparents inhabited. Baby pictures from friends living in a far-off Austrian village greet me when I go online after my morning coffee. A momentary uptick in Sri Lankan tea prices zips through global markets at the impossible speed of high-frequency trading. We can fly halfway around the world only to board an on-demand car service and stay in a stranger\u2019s apartment complete with an unfamiliar toilet and a friendly list of local tips taped to the fridge. While I worked my way through the rough draft, more modern oddities presented themselves. I used Google Maps to track the trajectory of a character's flight to and from the Arctic. I played around with a research tool that projects the impacts of sea-level rise on specific urban areas. I discovered the beautiful true story of the Golden Record via Maria Popova\u2019s peerless blog, Brainpickings. Just for fun, I backed a Swedish artist\u2019s Kickstarter project and began a collaboration with a designer living in Argentina and an illustrator living in New Zealand. My grandfather spoke Esperanto, but he would never have recognized this weird dimension we insist on calling \u201creality.\u201d Cars, telegrams, planes, phones, trains, broadcast media, and container ships made the world smaller. Now the internet is stitching the strange, scary, and wonderful pieces together into a single civilization. Unfortunately the results aren\u2019t always pretty. As I write this, authoritarian populism is rearing its ugly head, hate-mongers dominate the news cycle, and a country of immigrants is beginning to turn away people like Marvin. This is something my grandparents would recognize in a heartbeat. Fear at an uncertain future is all too understandable. Technology isn\u2019t just making our national borders more porous; it\u2019s shifting the borders of the twentieth-century social contract and causing a lot of people a lot of suffering. But letting fear get in the way of reason leads to ruin. Civilization is more delicate than it seems, and unlike previous civilizations that were geographically limited, this is the only one we\u2019ve got. Progress is painful. We use technology to do work we would prefer to avoid, and then need to make up new jobs for ourselves. We enjoy the cheap prices made possible by offshore manufacturing, and then realize we can\u2019t enforce social or environmental regulations across the supply chain. We download entire libraries of pirated music, and then discover we must support artists if we want more of what we love. Problems beget solutions beget new problems. The snake eats its tail, and we go round and round again. But that doesn\u2019t mean things don\u2019t get better. Child mortality, infectious disease, poverty, and violent death are at all-time lows. Literacy, longevity, and scientific knowledge are at all-time highs. There isn\u2019t a time in all of history I\u2019d rather live in than the present, and there\u2019s nothing more important than doing our part to build a better future. When I finally reached the end of the rough draft, Diana, the protagonist, had become a close friend. As a quirky and dangerously competent spy, she was enormous fun to write. Chapter by chapter, she developed a stronger and stronger sense of agency until I felt like I was documenting her adventures rather than inventing them. Diana proved herself to be the kind of person who doesn\u2019t shy away from hard truths, who confronts and overcomes her own flaws, who aspires to serve rather than rule others, and who fights through all the madness and pain that life throws her way in order to do what she feels is right. I have a lot to learn from her. Perhaps we all do. Thank you for reading. I put everything I have into this story, and if you\u2019re still with me, I can only hope that it will resonate with you. As in so many other arenas of life, the borders delineating the publishing industry are changing fast. But there\u2019s at least one thing that\u2019s as true as ever: writers write manuscripts, but books succeed thanks to the support and enthusiasm of readers. If you enjoy Borderless, please leave a review and tell your friends about it. It may feel insignificant, but nothing is more powerful than word of mouth. Onward and upward.

Wells short story \u201cIn the Abyss\u201d <TheKnightMadder>: Rifters by Peter Watts is about a bunch of people working in an abyssal level sea base. It's very 20 minutes into the future biopunk, in that the divers have been modified to be able to survive swimming around there with minimal equipment, some even feeling more comfortable out there in the pitch dark freezing water than inside the claustrophobic hull of their seabase. I'm pretty sure it's free too.

Fallout 3 and nv were my gateway drug. :)<TheKnightMadder>: Jeez, why haven't you played Prey man! It's literally by the same devs as Dishonored, and published by Bethesda (though they made a few stupid marketing decisions). It's also really story based, but not in the normal way. It's hugely into the 'figure it out yourself by reading peoples emails, memos, audio logs and the occasional recording you made yourself' sort of thing. Reviews were very positive for it, but for some reason it just didn't sell too well (again Bethesda did sort of fuck up the marketing so that might be it). <EDIT>: Here, have a trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJsha\\_16yrc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJsha_16yrc) And this is a gameplay trailer for the DLC, which gives you an idea of what the action is like: [https://youtu.be/qUJqMiUPTFM](https://youtu.be/qUJqMiUPTFM) There was one other trailer too, but it was hot garbage and should not be watched. &amp;#x200B;<neonbliss>: I don\u2019t know.

[link](https://i.redd.it/pmjq8ktj4p421.png) What I loved about Shiro and how Dreamworks handled the character was that \"it wasn't forced onto the audience\". For example \"here's a gay character from the start and everyone should fall in love with them. Otherwise you're a bigot!\". What I find more in modern science fiction shows is that they're trying too hard to \"be progressive for the sake of being progressive\" and just giving \"forced diversity\". For example, the newer Star Wars has a female hero \"Rey\" who just kicks ass for the sake of kicking ass. Even though she's never had any training and knows little about the force. Often criticized as a \"Mary Sue\". Why..........because \"feminism and girl-power and we can sell this stuff off\" Then in The Last Jedi, we have Vice-Admiral Haldo, who came across as an incompetent leader, but the audience is suppose to like her even when she makes bad decisions. Again with Rose, a chubby Asian woman who comes across as annoying and is not charismatic or likable, but we're suppose to like her because it's sexist otherwise. In the last seasons of Doctor Who, we were introduced to the companion \"Bill\" who is a lesbian black women. In the adventure she's goes on with the Doctor through times and space, almost every opportunity, she introduces herself as a lesbian. Which is unrealistic as a hetro character wouldn't just go around saying \"Hi, How are you doing? I'm a straight guy\" everywhere they went. In the more recent Star Trek Discovery, we're introduced to a gay couple. Again it just feels very forced and any criticism is met with taunting. An example on handling diversity which did work, was the original Star Trek. You had an engineer who \"just happens to be Scottish\". A helmsman \"who happens to be Japanese\". A communications officer who \"happens to be a woman and black\". These traits didn't define them as a person, in the same way that Captain Picard was bald and played by an English man. Or Lando Calrissian was black. People loved Lando Calrissan because he was cool, slick and charismatic. People loved Picard because he came across a strong leader. The audience like these characters because they're likable characters. Their colour, sex or sexual orientation becomes irrelevant. In the same way that someone's hair or eye colour is irrelevant. What I really liked about Shiro, is that they made a very \"likable\" character. He's a veteran hero, a competent leader, brave, has his own struggles and doubts and tries to overcome them and lifts people up and overall acts like a big brother to the rest of the team...............who happens to also be gay. I really liked the character and in the end, his race, gender and sexual orientation became completely irrelevant and didn't matter That's how you strengthen diversity and that's how you make good presentation.<ShoddyDiscussion>: I honestly have never cared about the gender or sexuality of a character, and unless it's vital to the story you're telling, it doens't matter...at some point, whether or not someone is gay will not matter, whether or not someone is a man or woman will not matter, whether or not someone is of X descent will not matter...at that point, that's your equality, when NONE of it actually matter. And I mean, you had a succubus main character on lost girl who basically had sex with any gender, and it just was...<monkey_sage>: Do you at least understand why it may be important for minorities to see themselves in popular culture? I understand that *you* may not care, but can you understand why others might?<ShoddyDiscussion>: Yes, I understand, what with growing up jewish in america, I understand what it's like not to see your self represented in popular culture as much. <monkey_sage>: That's nice to hear, that you can relate :) Thank you for your honesty.<ShoddyDiscussion>: It's amazing how this seems like sarcasm and pisses me off<monkey_sage>: It's not, I was sincere.", "num_messages": 7, "avg_score": 1.5714285714}

I'm particularly interested in books that touch on the economic aspects of Utopian society, either in a way that's central to the novel, or in a way that's heavily fleshed out in the process of world-building. e.g. if the world is post-scarcity, how/why is it post-scarcity, and how does the book speculate on the consequences of post-scarcity? In a Utopian Far Future, what is capitalism replaced by, or does it evolve, and if so, into what? -- those kinds of questions. Thanks!<KeavesSharpi>: The Culture series by Iain Banks is right up your alley. <newobj>: This def seems to come up the most. I was a bit off because the first book seemed to be about war?<KeavesSharpi>: Yes, but it's a war between the utopian Culture and the fanatical Idirans. And it shows how a true technological utopia even deals with war, which itself is pretty cool. The series is a bunch of books that are generally completely unrelated stories, that take place in the context of The Culture. So you get to see all kinds of facets of it, and the worlds that it interacts with. It's really just what you're looking for based on the details of your request. Honestly the first book can be a bit of a let down in parts, but it does a good job of introducing you to The Culture, and why some people feel opposed to it. Also, the war itself is the backdrop of the story, not the story itself. <newobj>: I see. Thanks!", "num_messages": 5, "avg_score": 1.4}

A few examples being that I'm a fan of Warframe, Lovecraft, and cyberpunk franchises like Blade Runner/Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and Shadowrun. I know cyberpunk doesn't really fall into the \"weird\" of weird Sci Fi but that's just stuff I'm looking for more of. <mobyhead1>: You\u2019ll have to be more specific. Written science fiction already tends to be weirder than movies and TV.<TheRatMann>: Well things like Lovecraft, Warframe, and Shadowrun all tend to have this mixture of science with spirituality or magic, especially Lovecraft and Shadowrun whereas Warframe tends to treat the weird or alien as something normal that isn't really questioned.
