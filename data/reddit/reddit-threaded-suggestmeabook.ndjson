Don't care so much about if you get it or not, try to enjoy the insanity, and if you do you will be very rewarded. <BooksAreMyVice>: Thanks a million. I only ask because sometimes reading a book about the book can really help with these expansive tomes. That's what got me though Ulysses (Portals of Discovery / Understanding Joyce) and Infinite Jest (DT Max's bio gave the all the motivation I needed there - lots of Pynchon talk too). <qfwfq9>: I understand the appeal of reading something on the side of something large and complex just to get through it. Gravity's Rainbow is tough and if you really want to get the most out of the first reading I'd suggest the online notes\u00b9 as they summarize large parts of the book where the plot goes through a lot of twists and turns. It's just a summary though, but very helpful. The companion book is not so helpful since it maps out all the references and tries to follow the thought process of Pynchon instead of analyzing the work. It should be saved until the second or third time you read it. Something that has helped me with reading complex books is reading along to the audio book. Ulysses, Finnegans Wake, The Tunnel, and JR are a few books that rely heavily on the spoken language, and will therefore reward you with a lot of nuance that will go missed without sound. It also helped me with morale during the more abstract parts of Finnegans Wake. For Gravity's Rainbow I'm not sure but I'm thinking about reading it again with the audio since there's so many weird puns sprinkled through out the book. Good luck, and don't remember to let yourself laugh! \u00b9https://www.ottosell.de/pynchon/rainbow.htm<BooksAreMyVice>: Thanks so much for all those fantastic notes. I was the same with Joyce, and can definitely see the essential element of reading aloud / listening to certain points so that the onomatopoeia and linguistic tricks can reveal themselves, whereas an internalised narrative might have missed them. I've enjoyed some of the 'lighter' Pynchon books, but this will be my first time with GR. Once again, thank you. Your input has been very useful.

It so accurately describes the condition that although I wasn't actively suicidal at the start of the book, it dredged that feeling back up within me. I worry that it's not a good idea to encourage somebody facing suicidal thoughts to connect with a semiautobiographical book written by a woman who did in fact commit suicide. I'd rather recommend books that show the utter hopelessness of rock bottom, the protagonist in crisis, melting down and feeling like their mind is at war with itself, and then show that life can and does move beyond crisis. In one way The Bell Jar does this, but for me, it left me feeling more empty than I started. While pain never does go away, we need to respect it, and learn from it. For me, that pain eventually taught me the color of the air in my lungs and the deweyness of grass on my feet. So much can bloom from pain, and hope exists.

I might just be a little motherly about it :P<Lisbeth_Salandar>: Imo, reading the bell jar helped me feel less suicidal because I felt less alone and like what I was going through was quantified right there.

For crime I recommend David Simon\u2019s \u201cHomicide: A Year on the Killing Streets\u201d where a reporter shadowed Baltimore homicide detectives for a year and wrote down everything he saw. David Simon also created the TV show The Wire.<DwarfishIbuprofen>: Thanks for the recommendations!

This last (fall) semester has been an absolute *beast*, and I haven't been able to dedicate the time necessary to read as I usually do. That said, here are some books I read this year that I really enjoyed. I picked up several from years past that I've been meaning to get to: **H is for Hawk**: man, this one really, *really* got me. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. The way the author rights is just...engrossing. I really *felt* for her and rooted for her and was so happy for her all throughout her journey of raising that hawk. Beautiful book. **Sapiens**: *Fantastic!* Should be required reading of all humans. It opened my mind to ideas I'd never thought about, made me realize that we have come such a long way from where humans once were. Plus, it helped solidify my shifting views on religion. Three years ago, I left Mormonism and entered a confusing \"midland\" between belief in God and belief in...nothing. Now, after *Sapiens*, I am much more comfortable is accepting things as they are, that God is a great idea for people to rely on for comfort and such, but that science, evolution, and logical explanations for why we are here, where we came from, and where we're going win the day in the end. That leads me to my *favorite book I read this year*: **Educated, by Tara Westover**: I cannot stop praising this book. I read it in two days, despite being so busy with school and other things. I couldn't put it down. It hit me so hard (coming from a Mormon background myself), and the story of triumph, resilience, and bravery was incredible. I've recommended it to any person who asks me for a book suggestion. I've given out three copies of it as gifts, and have purchased another five to send as Christmas gifts. I want everybody to read this fantastic book. Up next? I am finishing my finals tomorrow. I want to read *a lot* over the Christmas holiday break I have. I've got **How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan** and **Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke by Sarah Smarsh** coming from Amazon on Saturday.

He often stays up all night and sleeps all day. He has been homeschooled for thee years after experiencing bullying in middle school, mostly because of his weight. I use \"homeschooled\" loosely, as the program he uses has just a few very minimal requirements, which he usually fulfills over a week or two right before they are due at the end of each of semester, so he really doesn't go to school at all. I actually don't think he has completed all of his courses in recent semesters, so is below grade level. He experiences anxiety, which has a lot to do with why his parents allowed him to leave school and quit sports (which he continued for awhile, but eventually quit entirely). For example, I have been to his house many times over the last year, and have only seen him once, for about five minutes. &amp;#x200B; He is a smart kid, but is behind in many basics at this point.

I\u2019ve been assured that if you analyze his controversial statements, you\u2019ll see that they aren\u2019t controversial. However, I just don\u2019t feel comfortable with the sexist, racist, transphobic counter culture that some of his followers stray towards.

With that being said, I think it\u2019s great that his writing has helped out many people, but I don\u2019t necessarily feel that his ideas are revolutionary or unique.

Do people really think we ought to judge art by the quality of its admirers?<troplazy>: And the he goes and says that woman that use make up and then complain about sexual harassment in the office are hypocrites <tman37>: That isn't what he said at all. He said if we want to remove all aspects of sexuality from the work place we need to address things like make up, high heels etc. because the purpose of them is to enhance sexual characteristics like red lips, big eyes, up turned butt and shapely calves. His point is that there will always be some sort of sexual interest/behaviour anytime you mix men and women. And that short of dressing everyone in the same form hiding smocks, it is just the nature of people and we should accept that. Once we accept that sexual behaviour between men and women is normal, we can discuss limitations from a realistic perspective. <sangemini>: I agree that that is one of his quotes that gets very very misconstrued and is often used against him, and sure, that might be a good point. However, it\u2019s easy for a misogynist or incel to take that point and say \u201cif women don\u2019t want to be harassed, maybe they shouldn\u2019t wear make up. I\u2019m not to blame for my sexual behavior, women put that on themselves\u201d and it overlooks the fact that in western society, an aspect of professionalism is looking nice and presentable. Women who don\u2019t wear make up are seen as incapable of taking care of themselves, thus would be seen as unprofessional if they didn\u2019t try to make themselves look nicer. Him pointing that out isn\u2019t clever or thought provoking. I think that thought process would occur to anyone. But it\u2019s placing blame on women. The equivalent argument for men I could say is \u201cwhy don\u2019t men not indulge in status symbols like cars and nice watches?\u201d <NorthEasternNomad>: As reasonable as this response is, you're essentially blaming JP for false interpretation and misuse of his words by others. That's hardly reasonable behavior from a person as intelligent and open as yourself. Consider this: there exists a grain of truth in JP's words. If there werent, you wouldn't be here, because he wouldn't bother you. Instead, you would dismiss it as guys being guys and move on. But it's gotten under your skin. Made you think. And that you're willing to listen is wonderful. But please, give Peterson a chance. Not his words as interpreted by others. Not the over muscled under brained reddit users. Just listen to JP, and I think you'll find that in the end, his is just an honest look at men and women, and by the interaction between them, as these things really exist, as opposed to the PC perspective society wants us to see. Thanks for coming here with an open mind.<sangemini>: I think your explanation of \u201can honest look at men and women\u201d is a good way to put it. And you\u2019re right, sometimes it\u2019s hard to put a mirror up to society and see what\u2019s there. It\u2019s \u201cevolutionary psychology,\u201d right?

I think it\u2019s good to be made aware of human natures...sometimes shitty, but natural tendencies. Tribalism is a good example. we are aware of the fact that throughout prehistoric human history we have had a natural tendency to see people different than us as a threat, or paint them as lesser, or whatever. In modern society that tendency has manifested itself as racism and we know that it has no place in this day in age. By being aware of that we can start to learn about racism and address it. So I don\u2019t have a problem with him being HONEST about it, what I don\u2019t like is the *finality* in his message. Where\u2019s the solution? I feel like that could just lead to people feeling like their shitty \u201cnatural\u201d tendencies are excusable, when really they\u2019re regressive to a massive degree. If he believes that the way to a better life is setting boundaries and expectations for yourself, why is he resistant when the \u201cpc\u201d culture tries to do it? (Pc culture might have been a bad example ghah) P.s. I really appreciate how respectful you were in your response, and perhaps you\u2019re right. Even if I don\u2019t end up agreeing with him, maybe having these thoughtful conversations was good for my brain!! <NorthEasternNomad>: Great response. I tend to think that Peterson understands a hard truth: there is no \"solution.\" Not as such. Men are men. Women are women. We each want what we want. There's no convenient solution to the nature of each respective Beast. Sure, PC Culture sees masculinity as a problem to be solved. But its not; its Male nature, healthy doses of masculinity are not toxic and there is no problem to solve. Rather, Peterson urges us to escape pradigms. PC, personal wants/desires and see these human beasts, and their behaviors, as they are, rather than as we want them to appear. Peterson is a sort of Platonic philosopher for behavior. Stop looking at the shadow image of behavior, colored by paradigm and expectations, and see the behavior, and its source, as it really is, as opposed to judging it by the flickering shadow upon the wall of your personal cave.

(Silly in a great way, don't get me wrong) But I was thinking about it, and the Scifi that I read that would most closely resemble the vibe and type of universe in this book, you might want to look into \"The Laundry Files\" series by Charles Stross -- Not so much space exploration in the \"rockets\" type of way, but in terms of high level physics and other dimensions/hell/possession/magic/horrors still being ostensibly a side effect of truly scary. The Series is referred to by \"The Laundry Files\" but the first book, called \"The Atrocity Archives\" (which is generally printed with a novella at the end, (\"The Concrete Jungle).... In the TLDR version, it follows another \"bob\" (this time Bob Howard) as he is drafted into a secret British govt. organization that works to actively suppress the knowledge of existence of \"Magic\" (super advanced math, the true language of the universe, can cause reflections and changes in higher dimensions that can affect changes in physical reality, but can also call \"other\" denizens of the multiverse, decidedly Event Horizon to the CORE in this regard. The series is set in contemporary times, where the amount of people thinking, plus the rise of ever more advanced computers(which can be used to more safely do \"magic\") is making us light up and look extra tasty for the Lovecraftian horrors that exist right beside us in the multiverse, watching, waiting, and licking their lips....

She has her first boyfriend and I\u2019m terrified she will get pregnant and try to pray the problem away because her bat shit crazy mom refuses to live in the 21st century. If you\u2019ve got a title that also teaches young women about self respect and loving themselves enough before being ready to practice safe sex that would be a bonus. Pretty specific but I thought I\u2019d give it a shot and ask. <Edit>: look for fiction. I know there are sex education books out there but I have to hide the message in fiction. Also, please don\u2019t openly judge me for going against her mother\u2019s wishes. There\u2019s a lot to this teen\u2019s upbringing that have led me to wanting to send her messages through fiction.<jyort>: Just tell her that you're worried that she's only being taught about abstinence and that she needs to find real information about sex in case she ever needs it. At 17 she's mature enough to hear it from you if she hasn't heard it elsewhere. It might be slightly awkward, but she'll most likely appreciate you being honest. Maybe suggest a youtube channel like sexplanations.<lalotele>: I think OP is trying to find a more subtle approach so as not to overstep her boundaries or upset her niece\u2019s mom.<jyort>: Yeah I know, I'm just saying it's not necessary to be subtle and the niece is definitely not going to tell her mom.<lalotele>: I\u2019d venture to guess you don\u2019t actually know that and OP probably knows better. I\u2019ve known kids from sheltered families who would in fact spill the information to their parents because they had been brainwashed so badly by their parents.<jyort>: I guess she could be unlike any 17yo I've ever met, but I find it more likely that OP is being overly cautious because that's generally how people treat talking about sex. OP should really consider thoroughly whether it truly isn't an option to just tell her that there are things she needs to know and that just having knowledge isn't going to violate any of her values. A subtle sex education is a likely to be poor sex education.<lalotele>: My parents never outright spoke to me about sex education and I learned through things like books and then research afterwards, and I was the smartest and safest of my peers. I had to teach my friend who had spoken with her parents that a blowjob did not cause pregnancy but that you should still use a condom while taking BC pills. This is not simply meant to be sex education, but an introduction to the subject so that hopefully OP\u2019s niece does research like I did. You literally know zero reasons why OP is doing it this way, it\u2019s ridiculous to think they\u2019re doing this because \u201cthis is how people treat talking about sex.\u201d There are so many more reasons and facets but very good job at painting things black and white. Yes, 17 year olds can in fact be different than the ones you have met believe it or not, not only is that anecdotal evidence for an entire population of teenagers but like I said even I myself have met teens who would tattle on whomever outright spoke to them about things their parents made \u201ctaboo.\u201d Please do get off your high horse in response to a post where OP is simply trying to help someone in a way you deem not good enough, even though you know so little of their situation. <jyort>: I think you're misunderstanding me. I'm not saying OP should give her a sex education, just that they should let her know that it's important to do that research and maybe give her a place to start. I get your point that I shouldn't be judging people I don't know, which is why I'm suggesting that they think carefully about it rather than insisting they do what I would. I didn't mean to say they should give her the talk, I was just using that as an example of people being overly cautious about talking about sex.", "num_messages": 8, "avg_score": 33.625}

Very action-packed but not in a way that's detrimental to the plot, every fight scene moves the plot forward (and there's a number of them, but not so much that it becomes repetetive).

Challenging both the idea of the addict's \"broken brain\" and the notion of a simple \"addictive personality,\" The New York Times Bestseller, Unbroken Brain, offers a radical and groundbreaking new perspective, arguing that addictions are learning disorders and shows how seeing the condition this way can untangle our current debates over treatment, prevention and policy. Like autistic traits, addictive behaviors fall on a spectrum -- and they can be a normal response to an extreme situation. By illustrating what addiction is, and is not, the book illustrates how timing, history, family, peers, culture and chemicals come together to create both illness and recovery- and why there is no \"addictive personality\" or single treatment that works for all. Combining Maia Szalavitz's personal story with a distillation of more than 25 years of science and research,Unbroken Brain provides a paradigm-shifting approach to thinking about addiction. Her writings on radical addiction therapies have been featured in The Washington Post, Vice Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times, in addition to multiple other publications. She has been interviewed about her book on many radio shows including Fresh Air with Terry Gross and The Brian Lehrer show.<thisISme4now>: I am a recovering addict and I have read this book.
